Carbon finance has emerged as a potential policy option to tackling global climate change, degradation of forests, and social development in poor countries. This paper focuses on evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of a set of forest based mitigation pilot projects that emerged under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The paper reviews research conducted in 2001-2002, drawing from empirical data from four pilot projects, derived from qualitative stakeholder interviews, and complemented by policy documents and literature. Of the four projects studied three are located in frontier areas, where there are considerable pressures for conversion of standing forest to agriculture. In this sense, forest mitigation projects have a substantial role to play in the region. Findings suggest however, that all four projects have experienced cumbersome implementation processes specifically, due to weak social objectives, poor communication, as well as time constraints. In three out of four cases, stakeholders highlighted limited local acceptance at the implementation stages. In the light of these findings, we discuss opportunities for implementation of future forest based mitigation projects in the land use sector. © 2007.","Forest based mitigation; Stakeholders; Sustainable development","carbon; agriculture; agroforestry; article; Bolivia; Brazil; climate change; conservation biology; deforestation; environmental change; forest management; global climate; interview; land use; pilot study; policy; priority journal; qualitative analysis; reforestation; research; social evolution; socioeconomics; sustainable development",,"carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Brown, K., Corbera, E., Exploring equity and sustainable development in the new carbon economy (2003) Clim.
