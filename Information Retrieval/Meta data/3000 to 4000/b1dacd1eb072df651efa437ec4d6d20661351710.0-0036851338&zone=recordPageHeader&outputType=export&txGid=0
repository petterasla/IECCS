The current flux of carbon out of fossil fuels is about 600 times greater than that into fossil fuels. With increased concerns about global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, there have been several approaches proposed for managing the levels of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. One of the most understudied methods for CO2 mitigation is the use of biological processes in engineered systems such as photobioreactors. This research project describes the effectiveness of Chlorella vulgaris, used in a photobioreactor with a very short gas residence time, in sequestering CO2 from an elevated CO2 airstream. We evaluated a flow-through photobioreactor's operational parameters, as well as the growth characteristics of the C. vulgaris inoculum when exposed to an airstream with over 1850 ppm CO2. When using dry weight, chlorophyll, and direct microscopic measurements, it was apparent that the photobioreactor's algal inoculum responded well to the elevated CO2 levels and there was no build-up of CO2 or carbonic acid in the photobioreactor. The photobioreactor, with a gas residence time of approximately 2 s, was able to remove up to 74% of the CO2 in the airstream to ambient levels. This corresponded to a 63.9-g/m3/h bulk removal for the experimental photobioreactor. Consequently, this photobioreactor shows that biological processes may have some promise for treating point source emissions of CO2 and deserve further study.","Carbon dioxide; Chlorella vulgaris; Greenhouse gas; Photobioreactor","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; chlorophyll; fossil fuel; article; Chlorella vulgaris; dry weight; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; nonhuman; photobioreactor; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Chlorella; Chlorophyll; Light; algae; Chlorella vulgaris",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Chlorophyll, 1406-65-1",,,,"Abraham, E.R., Law, C.S., Boyd, P.W., Lavendar, S.J., Maldonado, M.T., Bowie, A.R., Importance of stirring in the development of an iron-fertilized phytoplankton bloom (2000) Nature, 407, pp. 727-730; Methods for biomass production (1998) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, , American Public Health Association, Baltimore, MD; Belasco, W., Algae burgers for a hungry world?
