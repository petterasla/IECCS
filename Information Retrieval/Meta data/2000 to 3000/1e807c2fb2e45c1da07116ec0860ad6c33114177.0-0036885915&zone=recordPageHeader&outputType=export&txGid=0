An empirical-statistical model for heat stress is constructed for the city of Lisbon using the June-August months of the observational period 1980-1998. The model uses the regression of an aggregate dose-response relationship between maximum temperature and excess heat-related deaths, based on the difference between observed and expected deaths. The model is validated by correlation and residual analysis. The mean annual heat-related mortality for the period 1980-1998 was between 5.4 and 6 deaths per 100,000 depending on the method used to calculate expected deaths. Both validation methods show that the model has a moderate to high accuracy in modelling heat-related deaths compared to the observed record.","Climate; Heat stress; Heat waves; Heat-related deaths; Lisbon; Mortality","article; biological model; heat injury; human; meteorological phenomena; mortality; Portugal; season; validation study; Heat Stress Disorders; Humans; Meteorological Factors; Models, Biological; Portugal; Seasons",,,,,,"Carvalho, R., A influência das condições meteorológicas e do clima sobre doenças humanas (1999) Rev Port Saúde Pública, 1, pp. 23-45; Donaldson, G., Kovats, R.S., Keatinge, W.R., McMichael, A.J., The potential impact of climate change on heat- and cold-related mortality and morbidity (2001) Health Effects of Climate Change in the UK, , Department of Health (ed).
