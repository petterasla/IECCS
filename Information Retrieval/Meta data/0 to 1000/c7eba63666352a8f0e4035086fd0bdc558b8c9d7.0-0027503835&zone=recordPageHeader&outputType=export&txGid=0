The paper suggests policies that will allow these African nations to support the growth in energy services required to foster economic development through the use of less carbon-intensive technologies. Such an energy strategy would raise the quality of life of the sub-Saharan African people, and simultaneously restrain the growth of energy-related carbon emissions. Given the necessary infrastructure and political commitment, these countries can overcome the barriers that could prevent the successful implementation of these policies without sacrificing their developmental goals. © 1993.","Carbon reductions; Energy policies; Sub-Saharan African","carbon dioxide emissions; carbon emission; climatic change; developing country; emission control; energy policy; energy supply; Africa, (sub-Sahara)",,,,,,"World Bank, (1990) World Development Report 1990, , Oxford University Press, New York; Lashof, Tirpak, (1990) Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate, , paper written for the US Congress, US Environmental Protection Agency, Office Of Policy Planning and Evaluation, Washington, DC; Davidson, Energy Decisions in Developing Countries in African: A Case Study of Sierra Leone (1988) IDRC Manuscript Report MR 192e, , International Development Research Centre, Ottawa; Hall, Rosillo-Calle, African forests and grasslands: sources or sinks of greenhouse gases (1991) A Change in the Weather: African Perspectives on Climate Change, pp. 49-60. , S.H.
