As such, even today, electric utilities are making resource planning and investment decisions that consider the possible implications of these future carbon regulations. In this article, we examine the manner in which utilities assess the financial risks associated with future carbon regulations within their long-term resource plans. We base our analysis on a review of the most recent resource plans filed by 15 electric utilities in the Western United States. Virtually all of these utilities made some effort to quantitatively evaluate the potential cost of future carbon regulations when analyzing alternate supply- and demand-side resource options for meeting customer load. Even without federal climate regulation in the US, the prospect of that regulation is already having an impact on utility decision-making and resource choices. That said, the methods and assumptions used by utilities to analyze carbon regulatory risk, and the impact of that analysis on their choice of a particular resource strategy, vary considerably, revealing a number of opportunities for analytic improvement. Though our review focuses on a subset of US electric utilities, this work holds implications for all electric utilities and energy policymakers who are seeking to minimize the compliance costs associated with future carbon regulations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric utilities; Greenhouse gas; Resource planning","Air pollution; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Competition; Decision making; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Finance; Global warming; Investments; Occupational risks; Problem solving; Public policy; Public utilities; Resource allocation; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Carbon dioxide emissions; Compliance costs; Current practices; Financial risks; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas; Investment decisions; Policy-makers; Resource planning; Western United States; Laws and legislation; carbon dioxide; climate change; decision making; demand-side management; global climate; greenhouse gas; policy making; resource management; utility sector; North America; United States",,,,,,"Andrews, C., Govil, S., Becoming proactive about environmental risks: regulatory reform and risk management in the US electricity sector (2007) Energy Policy, 23 (10), pp. 885-892; Barbose, G., Wiser, R., Phadke, A., Goldman, C., (2008) Reading the Tea Leaves: How Utilities in the West are Managing Carbon Regulatory Risk in their Resource Plans, , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory LBNL-44E; Bokenkamp, K., LaFlash, H., Singh, V., Wang, D., Hedging carbon risk: protecting customers and shareholders from the financial risk associated with carbon dioxide emissions (2005) The Electricity Journal, 18 (6), pp. 11-24; Bolinger, M., Wiser, R., (2005) Balancing Cost and Risk: The Treatment of Renewable Energy in Western Utility Resource Plans, , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory LBNL-58450; Cavanagh, R., Gupta, A., Lashof, D., Tatsutani, M., Utilities and CO2 emissions: who bears the risks of future regulation?
