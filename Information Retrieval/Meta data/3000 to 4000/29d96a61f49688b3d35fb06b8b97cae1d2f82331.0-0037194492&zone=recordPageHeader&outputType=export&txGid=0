Forest Tree Physiology, Rennweg 1, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Only a few studies focused on variations in stem respiration within entire trees related to variations within sapwood temperature. In this study, sapwood temperature was measured in 1 cm depth at four positions in the stem of a 50-year-old cembran pine (Pinus cembra L.) throughout the year 1995. These temperature data were used to estimate variations in CO2 efflux within the stem, assuming that the temperature dependence of respiration was constant and that there is no difference in the number of living cells in the xylem throughout the entire stem. Respiration was compared on a surface area basis. South-facing sapwood temperatures were significantly higher than air temperature when compared to north-facing sapwood temperature. As a consequence annual respiration was up to 13% higher on the south than on the north side of the tree. Thus, within-stem variations in temperature have been taken into account when scaling up stem respiration from data obtained from one individual position within a tree.","Pinus cembra; Sapwood temperature; Stem respiration","Pinus cembra",,,,,,"Amthor, J.S., Plant respiratory responses to the environment and their effects on the carbon balance (1994) Plant-environment interactions, pp. 501-554. , Wilkinson R.
