CH4 and CO2 are the two major constituents of biogas and also the two important greenhouse gases causing the present global warming. Average CH4 and CO2 emission per plant from the floating gasholder model biogas plants ranged between 73 8.92 and 742 81.53 g d-1 and 159 17.31 and 1476 152.63 g d-1, respectively. Emissions from the fixed dome biogas plants ranged between 93 20.63 and 288 46.53 g d-1 CH4 and 196 40.90 and 598 93.70 g d-1 CO2. The current contribution of greenhouse gases from the installed biogas plants in India toward the annual atmospheric CH4 and CO2 budget is estimated to be approximately 0.143 and 0.306 Tg, respectively.","Biogas plant; Carbon dioxide; Emission; Greenhouse gases; Methane","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Biogas plants; Energy production; Gas emissions",,,,,,"Debnath, G., Jain, M.C., Kumar, S., Sarkar, K., Sinha, S.K., Methane emissions from rice fields amended with biogas slurry and farm yard manure (1996) Climatic Change, 33, pp. 97-109; Hutchinson, G.L., Moiser, A.R., Improved soil cover method for field measurement of nitrous oxide flux (1981) Soil Sci.
