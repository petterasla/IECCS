Before magma becomes a practical source of power, many engineering problems must still be solved. When they are solved, the most likely site for the first magma power plant is Long Valley, California, US. This paper examines the greenhouse benefits from developing Long Valley. By generating magma power and by curtailing an equal amount of fossil power, the expected mass and the expected discounted value of reduced CO2 emissions are estimated. For both measures, the expected benefits seem to be substantial. -from Author",,"alternative energy; Electricity; electricity production; emission control; environmental benefit; geothermal power; global warming; greenhouse benefit; greenhouse effect; magma power; Magma Power; USA, California, Long Valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028803451
