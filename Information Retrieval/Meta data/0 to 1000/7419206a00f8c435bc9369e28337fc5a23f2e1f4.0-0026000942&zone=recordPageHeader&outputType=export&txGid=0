The methodology also allows a determination of the extent to which each technology can contribute to abatement by a specified date. The primary focus of the paper concerns carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The analysis concludes that of seventeen different abatement options examined, the nuclear option is the most expensive, except for the marginal CO2 savings achieved from advanced coal technology. A combination of energy efficiency measures and high efficiency gas-fired generation can achieve CO2 savings approaching 285 million tonnes per year by year 2005. This represents a saving of 46.5% over existing emissions from the stationary sector (ie excluding transport). If the analysis is extended to include the effect of methane emissions from fossil fuel cycles, the advantages of energy efficiency and the renewable generating sources is improved. © 1991.","Cost-effectiveness; Energy-efficiency; Global warming","carbon dioxide; emission control; energy policy; global warming; greenhouse effect",,,,,,"IPCC, (1990) Policy Makers Summary, , Bracknell, UK; (1988) The Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security, Conference Statement, , Toronto, Canada; (1988) Escaping the Heat Trap - an NGO Statement of Policies to Prevent Climate Change, , Climate and Development Congress, Hamburg; Ministry of Housing, Physical Planning and Environment, (1989) High-lights of the Dutch National Environment Policy Plan, , The Hague, the Netherlands; Grubb, (1989) The Greenhouse Effect: Negotiating Targets, , For a fuller discussion see, Royal Institute of International Affairs, London, UK; Keepin, Kats, Greenhouse warming: comparative analysis of nuclear and efficiency abatement strategies (1988) Energy Policy, 16 (6), pp. 538-561. , Many observers have explicitly called for such an approach. See for example; Dale, Abatement of greenhouse gases in the UK (1989) ETSU paper to the OECD experts seminar in Paris; Barbier, Pearce, Thinking economically about climate change (1990) Energy Policy, 18 (1), pp. 11-18; Lashof, Ahuja, Relative global warming potentials of greenhouse gas emissions (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 529-531; The clean-up of sites already contaminated with toxic waste is one example; the prevention of further pollution from toxic wastes still being generated is anotherIt should also be mentioned that demand can be reduced by lifestyle changes, in other words by reducing the demand for energy services, as well as by supplying the demand more efficiently. The present paper does not investigate this possibility, however. It assumes that the demand for services is met. The economic growth rates assumed for the analysis lie towards the middle of the range of those assumed within the EEO reportsRocky Mountain Institute, (1986) Advanced Electricity Saving Technologies and the South Texas Project, , See, for instance, Colorado, CO, USA; The Alliance to Save Energy, (1988) Designing and Evaluating Demand Side Management Rebate Programs: Analytical Tools and Case Study Application, , Washington DC, USA; Ontario Ministry of Energy, (1987) Electricity Conservation: Supply Curves for Ontario, , Ottawa, Canada; Strictly speaking a fully dynamic modelling exercise could reveal some subtleties that will not emerge from the ‘snap-shot year’ approach adopted here. One of the limitations which should properly be taken into account in a fully dynamic model, is that the costs associated with each aggregated abatement option have been assumed to be constant. In fact, it is likely, particularly for end-use options, that each technology ‘block’ in the supply curve, will have a profile which is non-rectilinear. A more sophisticated analysis might reveal a ‘blurring’ of the dividing lines between the different abatement options, and provide a kind of ‘mix-and-match’ picture of cost-effectiveness: there might be different tranches of energy-efficient lighting for instance at different costs, some more expensive, some less expensive than certain energy-efficient appliances, say. Generally speaking, for energy efficiency, I [[Truncated]]Olivier, (1983) Energy Efficient Futures, , Earth Resources Research, London, UK; (1984) Energy Use and Energy Efficiency in UK Manufacturing Industry up to the Year 2000, 3. , Energy Efficiency Office, HMSO, London, UK, in the Energy Efficiency Series (EEO3); (1988) Energy Use and Energy Efficiency in UK Commercial and Public Buildings up to the Year 2000, 6. , Energy Efficiency Office, HMSO, London, UK, in the Energy Efficiency Series (EEO6); Energy Use and Energy Efficiency in the UK Domestic Sector up to the Year 2010, draft report to be published(1988) Medium and Long-term Load Estimates: Methodology and Forecasts, , CEGB, London, UK; This year has been chosen as being roughly in line with targets for reduction and stabilization of emissions commonly discussedThis estimate is slightly lower than some others, because it is based on delivered fuel and excludes fuel consumed within the fuel supply industriesSince this represents a likely ‘worst-case’ from the point of view of CO2 emissionsJackson, (1988) The Technical and Economic Comparison of Non-Fossil Fuelled Electricity Supply Options, COLA 13, , Evidence to the Hinkley Point Inquiry on behalf of the Coalition of Opposing Local Authorities, Somerset; A.
