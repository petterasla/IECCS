However, the impact of climate change on forest population dynamics, especially at the landscape or regional level, has hardly been addressed before. A new methodology was proposed to enable matrix transition models to account for climate impact on forest population dynamics. The first climate-sensitive matrix (CSMatrix) model was developed for the Alaska boreal forest based on observations from over 15. years of forest inventory. The spatially explicit model was used to map climate-induced forest population dynamics across the region. The model predicted that the basal area increment in the region under natural succession would be hindered by global warming, more so for dry upland areas than for moist wetlands. It was suggested that temperature-induced drought stress could more than offset a predicted increase of future precipitation in the region to lower overall forest productivity. At the same time, stand diversity would increase across the region through transient species redistribution. Accounting for climate conditions made the CSMatrix model more accurate than conventional matrix models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate scenario; Climate-induced change; Deterministic simulation; Empirical model; Forest population dynamics; Transition matrix model","Climate scenarios; Climate-induced change; Deterministic simulation; Empirical model; Forest populations; Transition matrices; Computer simulation; Dynamics; Forestry; Global warming; Population dynamics; Climate models; basal area; boreal forest; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; ecological modeling; empirical analysis; forest dynamics; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; global climate; numerical model; population distribution; population dynamics; precipitation (climatology); succession; vegetation mapping; Alaska; Biological Populations; Climates; Forest Management; Mapping; Mathematical Models; Simulation; Alaska; United States",,,,,,"Balshi, M.S., McGuire, A.D., Zhuang, Q., Melillo, J., Kicklighter, D.W., Kasischke, E., Wirth, C., Shvidenko, A., The role of historical fire disturbance in the carbon dynamics of the pan-boreal region: a process-based analysis (2007) Journal of Geophysical Research, 112, pp. G02029; Barber, V.A., Juday, G.P., Finney, B.P., Reduced growth of Alaskan white spruce in the twentieth century from temperature-induced drought stress (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 668-673; Bliss, C.I., The calculation of the dosage-mortality curve (1935) Annals of Applied Biology, 22, pp. 134-167; Boisvenue, C., Running, S.W., Impacts of climate change on natural forest productivity - evidence since the middle of the 20th century (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 862-882; Boltz, F., Carter, D.R., Multinomial logit estimation of a matrix growth model for tropical dry forests of eastern Bolivia (2006) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 36, pp. 2623-2632; Bonan, G.B., Shugart, H.H., Environmental factors and ecological processes in boreal forests (1989) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 20, pp. 1-28; Buongiorno, J., Michie, B.R., A matrix model of uneven-aged forest management (1980) Forest Science, 26, pp. 609-625; Carter, T., Bärlund, I., Fronzek, S., Kankaanpää, S., Kaivo-oja, J., Luukkanen, J., Wilenius, M., Karvosenoja, N., The FINSKEN global change scenarios (2002) Understanding the global system.
