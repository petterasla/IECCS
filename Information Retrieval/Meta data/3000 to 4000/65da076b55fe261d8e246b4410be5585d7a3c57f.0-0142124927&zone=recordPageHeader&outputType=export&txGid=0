However, global burden of disease studies suggest that infectious diseases will contribute a proportionately smaller burden of disease over the next 2 decades as non-communicable diseases emerge as public health problems. However, infectious diseases contribute proportionately more in the poorest quintile of the population. Notwithstanding the different views of the impact of global warming on vector-borne infections this paper reviews the conditions which drive the changing epidemiology of these infections and suggests that such change is linked by common themes including interactions of generalist vectors and reservoir hosts at interfaces with humans, reduced biodiversity associated with anthropogenic environmental changes, increases in Plasmodium falciparum:P. vivax ratios and well-described land use changes such as hydrological, urbanization, agricultural, mining and forest-associated impacts (extractive activities, road building, deforestation and migration) which are seen on a global scale.","Agriculture deforestation; Burden of disease; Climate change; Vector-borne infections","agriculture; biodiversity; climate change; disease carrier; disease course; disease transmission; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; forestry; greenhouse effect; host pathogen interaction; hydrology; land use; mining; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; public health; review; social status; tropical disease; urbanization; Agriculture; Animals; Communicable Diseases; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost of Illness; Disease Vectors; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Malaria; World Health; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; Protozoa",,,,,,"Amerasinghe, F.P., Indrajith, N.G., Postirrigation breeding patterns of surface water mosquitoes in the Mahaweli Project, Sri Lanka, and comparisons with preceding developmental phases (1994) Journal of Medical Entomology, 4, pp. 516-523; Ashford, R.W., The leishmaniases as emerging and reemerging zoonoses (2000) International Journal of Parasitology, 30, pp. 1269-1281; Ashton, J., (1992) Healthy Cities, , (editor) Milton Keynes: Open University Press; Bouma, M., Climate change and tropical disease.
