Analyses of variation among genotypes in growth and morphology and genotype × environment interactions are necessary for restoration in, for example, different combinations of tide, soil, and salinity regimes, and for assessing how foundation plant species will respond to global climate change. We conducted a field experiment to assess differences in responses among 86 half-sibling (same maternal tree) seedling families of the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) to different environmental conditions of hydrology imposed at low- and high-intertidal settings. At 3 years, Rhizophora survival and growth varied with maternal tree genotype, elevation, and genotype × elevation. This effect was independent of size of propagules at planting. Growth also differed among the five islands planted, a main effect that is a composite of a number of microenvironmental differences stemming from island size and shape, proximity to passes (and thus fetch), and island slope. Significant genotype × island interactions for some response variables further support the hypothesis that seedlings of different maternal genotypes can perform very differently under various suites of environmental conditions. Planted seedlings reproduced at an early age, and at 3 years there were differences in reproductive output among genotypes but not an overall mean difference between plants at low or high elevation. Whether our results show adaptation to local conditions or differences in plasticity among genotypes will require further study as the plants mature further to demonstrate fitness differences. However, either adaptation or plasticity provides a basis for maintenance of Rhizophora dominance over a wider range of environmental conditions and may be important for adaptation to conditions that will vary with global climate change. © 2010 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Ecological genetics; Genotype × environment; Maternal genotype; Red mangroves; Tampa bay","climate change; environmental conditions; environmental stress; experimental study; genotype; genotype-environment interaction; growth rate; hydrological regime; local adaptation; mangrove; maternal effect; propagule; reproductive productivity; seedling; seedling establishment; survival; Rhizophora; Rhizophora mangle",,,,,,"Bradshaw, A.D., Some of the evolutionary consequences of being a plant (1972) Evolutionary Biology, 5, pp. 25-47; Bonfil, C., The effects of seed size, cotyledon reserves, and herbivory on seedling survival and growth in Quercus rugosa and Q. laurina (Fagaceae) (1998) American Journal of Botany, 85, pp. 79-87; Callaway, R.M., Pennings, S.C., Richards, C.L., Phenotpic plasticity and interactions among plants (2003) Ecology, 84 (5), pp. 1115-1128; Cardona-Olarte, P., Twilley, R.R., Krauss, K.W., Rivera-Monroy, V., Responses of neotropical mangrove seedlings grown in monoculture and mixed culture under treatments of hydroperiod and salinity (2006) Hydrobiologia, 569, pp. 325-341; Castillo-Cardenas, M.F., Toro-Peres, N., Cardenas-Henao, H., Population genetic structure of neotropical mangrove species on the Colombian Pacific coast: Pelliciera rhizophorae (Pellicieracea) (2005) Biotropica, 37, pp. 266-273; Chesson, P., Rosenzweig, M., Behavior, heterogeneity, and the dynamics of interacting species (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 1187-1195; Ceron-Souza, I., Toro-Pera, N., Cardenas-Henao, H., Population genetic structure of Neotropical mangrove species on the Colombian Pacific coast: Avicennia germinans (Avicenniaceae) (2005) Biotropica, 37, pp. 258-265; Crawford, K., Crutsinger, G.M., Sanders, N.J., Host-plant genotypic diversity mediates the distribution of an ecosystem engineer (2007) Ecology, 88, pp. 2114-2120; Devlin, D.J., (2004) Effects of Coccotrypes Rhizophorae on the Population and Community Structure of Forests Dominated by Rhizophora Mangle in Florida, , Ph.D. dissertation: University of Louisiana at Lafayette; Dodd, R.S., Afzal-Rafil, Z., Evolutionary genetics of mangroves: Continental drift to recent climate change (2002) Trees, 16, pp. 80-86; Duke, N.C., Benzie, J.A.H., Goodall, J.A., Ballment, E.R., Genetic structure and evolution of species in the mangrove genus Avicennia (Avicenniaceae) in the Indo-west Pacific (1998) Evolution, 52, pp. 1612-1626; Ge, X.J., Sun, M., Reproductive biology and genetic diversity of a cryptoviviparous mangrove Aegiceras corniculatum (Myrsinaceae) using allozyme and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis (1999) Molecular Ecology, 8, pp. 2061-2069; Geritz, S.A.H., Evolutionary stable seed polymorphism and small-scale spatial variation in seedling density (1995) American Naturalist, 146, pp. 685-707; Geritz, S.A.H., van der Meijden, E., Metz, J.A.J., Evolutionary dynamics of seed size and seedling competitive ability (1999) Theoretical Population Biology, 55, pp. 324-343; Goverde, M., Bazin, A., Shykoff, J.A., Erhardt, A., Influence of leaf chemistry of Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) on larval development of Polyommatus icarus (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae): Effects of elevated CO2 and plant genotype (1999) Functional Ecology, 13, pp. 801-810; Hammerli, A., Reusch, T.B.H., Local adaptation and transplant dominance in genets of the marine clonal plant Zostera marina (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 242, pp. 111-118; Huey, R.B., Carlson, M., Crozier, L., Frasier, M., Hamilton, H., Harley, C., Hoang, A., Kingsolver, J.G., Plants versus animals: Do they deal with stress in different ways?
