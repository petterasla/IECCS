However, it is not clear that local variations in ecological processes can be explained by large-scale patterns of climate. The North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) is a large-scale climate phenomenon that has been shown to influence the population dynamics of some animals. Although effects of the NAO on vertebrate population dynamics have been studied, it remains uncertain whether it broadly predicts the impact of weather on species. We examined the ability of local weather data and the NAO to explain the annual variation in population dynamics of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus) in Rocky Mountain National Park, USA. We performed canonical correlation analysis on the demographic subspace of ptarmigan and local-climate subspace defined by the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) using data from 1975 to 1999. We found that two subspaces were significantly correlated on the first canonical variable. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the first EOF values of the demographic and local-climate subspaces was significant. The population density and the first EOF of local-climate subspace influenced the ptarmigan population with 1-year lags in the Gompertz model. However, the NAO index was neither related to the first two EOF of local-climate subspace nor to the first EOF of the demographic subspace of ptarmigan. Moreover, the NAO index was not a significant term in the Gompertz model for the ptarmigan population. Therefore, local climate had stronger signature on the demography of ptarmigan than did a large-scale index, i.e., the NAO index. We conclude that local responses of wildlife populations to changing climate may not be adequately explained by models that project large-scale climatic patterns.","Climate effects; Demography; Lagopus leucurus; Large-scale climate; Local climate; North Atlantic oscillation; Population dynamics","Animalia; Lagopus; Lagopus leucurus; Vertebrata; animal; article; biological model; bird; climate; ecosystem; female; male; meteorological phenomena; population dynamics; United States; Animals; Birds; Climate; Colorado; Ecosystem; Female; Male; Meteorological Factors; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics",,,,,,"Braun, C.E., (1969) Population Dynamics, Habitat, and Movement of White-tailed Ptarmigan in Colorado, , PhD thesis, Colorado State University, Fort Collins.
