Steady-state solutions for the ice topography and thermodynamics, represented by the extent of the areas of basal melting, were shown to be in good agreement with both observations and results obtained from other three-dimensional thermodynamical equations. The solution for the basal temperature field of the West Antarctic Siple Coast produced areas at the pressure melting point separated by strips of frozen-to-bed ice, the structure of which looks very similar to ice streams A-E. Since the possible response of the Siple Coast basal temperature pattern to global warming and to associated changes in the snowfall rate is not obvious, a special sensitivity study was conducted. Results of such a study suggest that increased precipitation rate and associated intensification of ice advection can effectively ""shut down"" West Antarctic ice streams. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Global warming; Melting; Precipitation (meteorology); Sea level; Snow; Thermodynamics; Basal melting; Ice advection; Ice sheet model; Ice streams; Ice topography; Sea ice; basal melting; climate change; ice sheet; ice stream; Antarctica; Arctic and Antarctic; World",,,,,,"Greve, R., MacAyeal, D.R., Dynamic/thermodynamic simulations of Laurentide ice sheet instability (1996) Ann.
