The ecological impacts and costs of predicted weather-related extreme events, such as extreme temperatures, are not fully understood and may present unexpected challenges to conservationists that require solutions. In Portugal, provisioning of artificial nests has been the main driver of the spectacular increase in the endangered lesser kestrel population. Nevertheless, atypically high temperatures recorded during the 2009 breeding season coincided with a mortality of 22% of surveyed chicks in provided nests. Hot days did not affected prey delivery rates to the nestlings, suggesting that the die-off was due to chicks' acute dehydration. Chick mortality was significantly higher amongst younger individuals. Within survivors, physiological costs of high temperatures significantly affected chick growth and body condition at fledging. Nest-site microclimate was influenced by nest-type and compass orientation: wooden nest-boxes attained the highest temperatures, exceeding 55 °C when facing south, so explaining the recorded higher mortality, lower growth rates and lower fledging body condition among broods in these nests. Simulated scenarios of global warming with increasing occupation rate of artificial nests due to reductions in alternatives predicted a reduction in population growth rate. In the worst scenario, with a 100% occupancy of nest-boxes, the population growth would decline on average 7% per year. The impact of high temperatures on lesser kestrel breeding success highlights a need for actions to modify and research to adapt conservation efforts and future planning to account for climate change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Artificial nests; Climate change; Falco naumanni; Lesser kestrel; Temperature","artificial nest; body condition; breeding season; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; ecological impact; endangered species; environmental policy; extreme event; growth rate; high temperature; microclimate; mortality; nest site; population growth; raptor; reproductive success; Portugal; Falco naumanni",,,,,,"Altwegg, R., Roulin, A., Kestenholz, M., Jenni, L., Demographic effects of extreme winter weather in the barn owl (2006) Oecologia, 149, pp. 44-51; Amano, T., Richard, J., Smithers, R.J., Tim, H., Sparks, T.H., Sutherland, W.J., (2010), A 250-year index of first flowering dates and its response to temperature changes.
