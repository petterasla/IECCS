Of a total of 2,648 microsatellitecarrying fragments identified, 11 variable, reproducible markers were generated and tested on 41 individuals from two populations. Allelic diversity ranged from 3 to 10 alleles and heterozygosity values varied from 0 to 0.89 (H O) and 0.12 to 0.86 (H E). A cross-species test on four caddisfly species showed that a subset of markers amplifies in related taxa. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Aquatic insects; Dispersal; Global climate change; Landscape genetics; Microsatellite development; Montane biodiversity; Short tandem repeats","Drusus discolor; Hexapoda; Trichoptera",,,,,,"Bilton, D.T., Freeland, J.R., Okamura, B., Dispersal in freshwater invertebrates (2001) Ann Rev Ecol Syst, 32, pp. 159-181; Heino, J., Virkkala, R., Toivonen, H., Climate change and freshwater biodiversity: Detected patterns, future trends and adaptations in northern regions (2009) Biol Rev, 84, pp. 39-54; Lehrian, S., Pauls, S.U., Haase, P., Contrasting patterns of population structure in the montane caddisflies Hydropsyche tenuis and Drusus discolor in the Central European highlands (2009) Freshw Biol, 54, pp. 283-295; Parmesan, C., Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change (2006) Annu Rev Ecol Evol S, 37, pp. 637-660; Pauls, S.U., Lumbsch, H.T., Haase, P., Phylogeography of the montane caddisfly Drusus discolor: Evidence for multiple refugia and periglacial survival (2006) Mol Ecol, 15, pp. 2153-2169; Pauls, S.U., Feldheim, K.A., Haase, P., Isolation and characterization of microsatellite markers in the caddisfly Drusus discolor (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae) (2007) Mol Ecol Notes, 7, pp. 150-152; Rousset, F., GENPOP '007: A complete re-implementation of the GENEPOP Software for Windows and Linux (2008) Mol Ecol Resour, 8, pp. 103-106; Rozen, S., Skaletsky, H.J., (1998) Primer3.
