The scyphomedusan Chrysaora quinquecirrha occurs in the mesohaline portion of Chesapeake Bay each summer. Population sizes of the medusae show dramatic annual variations that are correlated with salinity and temperature. We measured the total numbers of ephyrae and polyps produced by benthic polyps of C. quinquecirrha in laboratory experiments lasting 42 d, and found that temperature (15, 20, 25°C) was not a statistically significant factor at low salinities (5 to 20 ‰); however, ephyra production increased significantly with increasing temperature at high salinities (20 to 35 ‰). Conversely, each 5°C decrease in temperature delayed strobilation (ephyra production) by about 1 wk. Salinity significantly affected the numbers of ephyrae and polyps produced in all experiments. Ephyra and polyp production was lower at both low (<11 ‰) and high salinities (≥25‰) than at intermediate salinities. Also, more ephyrae, but not polyps, were produced with more available prey. Medusa numbers were 2 orders of magnitude lower in July 1996 when water temperatures, salinities, and zooplankton densities in Chesapeake Bay all were lower than in July 1995. The effects of these factors are important in understanding the changes caused by human activities in near-shore ecosystems, including effects of global warming, eutrophication, and reduction of commercial species.","Asexual reproduction; Cnidaria; Environmental factors; Medusa; Salinity; Scyphistoma; Scyphozoa; Strobilation; Temperature; Zooplankton Production","asexual reproduction; population size; salinity; temperature; temporal variation; United States; Chrysaora quinquecirrha; Scyphozoa",,,,,,"Baird, D., Ulanowicz, R.E., The seasonal dynamics of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem (1989) Ecol Monogr, 59, pp. 329-364; Black, R.E., Webb, K.L., Metabolism of 131I in relation to strobilation in Chrysaora quinquecirrha (Scyphozoa) (1973) Comp Biochem Physiol, 45 A, p. 1023; Boynton, W.R., Boicourt, W., Brandt, S., Hagy, J., Harding, L., Houde, E., Holliday, D.V., Smith, E.M., Interactions between physics and biology in the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) of Chesapeake Bay, USA (1997) ICES, CM1997-S, p. 11; Brewer, R.H., Feingold, J.S., The effect of temperature on the benthic stages of Cyanea (Cnidaria: Scyphozoa), and their seasonal distribution in the Niantic River estuary, Connecticut (1991) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 152, pp. 49-60; Calder, D.R., Strobilation of the sea nettle, Chrysaora quinquecirrha, under field conditions (1974) Biol Bull, 146, pp. 326-334; Cargo, D.G., King, D.R., Forecasting the abundance of the sea nettle, Chrysaora quinquecirrha, in the Chesapeake Bay (1990) Estuaries, 13, pp. 486-491; Cargo, D.G., Rabenold, G.E., Observations on the asexual reproductive activities of the sessile stages of the sea nettle Chrysaora quinquecirrha (Scyphozoa) (1980) Estuaries, 3, pp. 20-27; Cargo, D.G., Schultz, L.P., Notes on the biology of the sea nettle, Chrysaora quinquecirrha, in Chesapeake Bay (1966) Chesapeake Sci, 7, pp. 95-100; Cargo, D.G., Schultz, L.P., Further observations on the biology of the sea nettle and jellyfishes in the Chesapeake Bay (1967) Chesapeake Sci, 8, pp. 209-220; Chen, J.K., Ding, B.W., Liu, C.Y., Effect of nutritional conditions on the strobilation of edible medusa, Rhopilema esculenta Kishinouye (1985) J Fish China/Shuichan Xuebao, 9, pp. 321-329; Cones H.N., Jr., Haven, D.S., Distribution of Chrysaora quinquecirrha in the York River (1969) Chesapeake Sci, 10, pp. 75-84; Cowan J.H., Jr., Houde, E.D., Relative predation potentials of scyphomedusae, ctenophores and planktivorous fish on ichthyoplankton in Chesapeake Bay (1993) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 95, pp. 55-65; Dumont, H.J., The distribution and ecology of the fresh- and brackish-water medusae of the world (1994) Hydrobiologia, 272, pp. 1-12; Gatz A.J., Jr., Kennedy, V.S., Mihursky, J.A., Effects of temperature on activity and mortality of the scyphozoan medusa, Chrysaora quinquecirrha (1973) Chesapeake Sci, 14, pp. 171-180; Gröndahl, R., Hernroth, L., Release and growth of Cyanea capillata (L.) ephyrae in the Gullmar Fjord, western Sweden (1987) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 106, pp. 91-101; Harding L.W., Jr., Perry, E.S., Long-term increase of phytoplankton biomass in Chesapeake Bay, 1950-1994 (1997) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 157, pp. 39-52; Hernroth, L., Gröndahl, R., On the biology of Aurelia aurita (L.): 1.
