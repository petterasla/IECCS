This approach provides a framework to measure the extrinsic environmental properties of materials. In the following, three properties-gross energy requirement, global-warming potential, and solid-waste burden-are broadly discussed for steel, aluminum, and polyethylene. The environmental profiles are then applied to assess the use of alternative materials in terms of the LCA of an automotive component. Given the possibility of a substantial variation in results, one must be careful with the scoping and assessment of LCA. Despite the limitations, it provides a useful map for improving environmental compatibility and performance. © 1994 TMS.",,"Aluminum; Automobiles; Materials; Performance; Polyethylenes; Service life; Steel; Life cycle analysis; Environmental protection",,,,,,"Fava, J.A., (1991) A Technical Framework for Product Life-Cycle Assessments, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Assies, J.A., (1991) Introduction Paper to the SETAC-Europe Workshop on Environmental Life Cycle Analysis of Products; Product Life-Cycle Assessment: Inventory Guidelines and Principles, EPA/600/R-92/036 (Cincinnati, OH: Risk Reduction Engineering Laboratory, U.S. EPA, November 1992)Hunt, R.G., Sellers, J.D., Franklin, W.E., Resource and Environmental Profile Analysis: A Life Cycle Environmental Assessment for Products and Procedures (1992) Environ.
