We suggest that a major predictor of the GWF is salinity of the wetland soil (a proxy for available sulfate), a factor often ignored in other studies. We assess the radiative balance of two northern salt marshes with average soil salinities &gt;20 ppt, but with high (macro-) and low (micro-) tidal amplitudes. The flux of greenhouse gases from soils at the end of the growing season averaged 485 ± 253 mg m-2 h-1, 13 ± 30 μg m -2 h-1, and 19 ± 58 μg m-2 h -1 in the microtidal marsh and 398 ± 201 mg m-2 h-1, 2 ± 26 μg m-2 h-1, and 35 ± 77 μg m-2 h-1 in the macrotidal marsh for CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively. High rates of C sequestration mean that loss of these marshes would have a radiative balance of -981CO2 eq. m-2 yr-1 in the microtidal and -567CO2 eq. m-2 yr-1 in the macrotidal marsh. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Radiative forcing; Tidal marsh","Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Feedback; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Anthropogenic activity; C sequestration; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Growing season; Nitrous oxide; Radiative balance; Radiative forcings; Tidal marshes; Wetlands; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; drainage; flux measurement; global warming; greenhouse gas; growing season; intertidal environment; methane; nitrous oxide; proxy climate record; radiative forcing; saltmarsh",,,,,"NSERC, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","Bartlett, K.B., Bartlett, D.S., Hariss, R.C., Sebacher, D.I., Methane emissions along a salt marsh salinity gradient (1987) Biogeochemistry, 4, pp. 183-202; Bauza, J.F., Morell, J.M., Corredor, J.E., Biogeochemistry of nitrous oxide production in the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) forest sediments (2002) Estuar., Coast.
