We suggest that increased productivity may increase the production and efflux of greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) and that shifts in phytoplankton species and productivity may cause changes in another climate-related gas, dimethylsulfide (DMS). N2O is also implicated in the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Rough calculations suggest that the enhanced release of N2O alone could totally negate any potential benefit from fertilization and likely worsen global warming and ozone depletion. -from Authors",,"biogeochemistry; iron; nitrous oxide; ocean fertilisation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026363618
