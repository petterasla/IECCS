These concerns have led to the investigation of many technologies and strategies for mitigation, both in the U.S. and abroad. One technology explored at ANL is integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation, which is based on extraction of CO2 by a solvent. The IGCC process reduces CO2 production through efficient fuel use, which makes CO2 recovery less expensive than conventional systems. Recovery using the following solvents was explored in detail: monoethanolamine (MEA), glycol, chilled methanol. and hot potassium carbonate. Other incentive-based options for mitigation have also been explored, including market incentives (carbon fees and tradable permits) and regulatory measures. Our work suggests a complex global strategy will be necessary to optimize options for mitigation of global climate change, one that takes into account both local and regional considerations.",,,,,,,,"(1989) General Motors Public Interest Report, pp. 20-27. , Detroit, MI; (1992) Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation and the Science Base, , National Academy Press, Washington, DC; (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K; (1990) A Guide to the Global Environment: 1990-1991, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; (1991) Statistical Abstract of the United States, 111th Edn., , U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC; French, H.F., Partnership for the planet: An environmental agenda for the United Nations (1995) World Watch Paper, 126. , World Watch Institute, Washington, DC July; The regions and global warming: Impacts and response strategies (1991) Document CONF-913221-Summ (The 1991 Woodlands Conference), , HARC Center for Growth Studies, The Woodlands, TX March; Doctor, R.D., Molburg, J.C., Thimmapuram, P.R., Berry, G.F., Livengood, C.D., Gasification combined cycle: Carbon dioxide recovery, transport and disposal (1994) Report ANL/EAD-24, , Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL September; Molburg, J.C., Thimmapuram, P., Doctor, R.D., Comparison of salient features of alternative CO2 recovery processes (1994) Report ANL/DIS/CP-82338, , Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL May; Manabe, S., Wetherald, R.T.W., (1980) J.
