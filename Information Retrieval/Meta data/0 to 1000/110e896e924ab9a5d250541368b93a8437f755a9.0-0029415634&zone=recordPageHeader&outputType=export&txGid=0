Despite certain discrepancies, nonavailability of data, the quality of some of the data collected, and the methodology, the estimates provide a provisional basis for Senegal to fulfill its obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This inventory reveals that GHG emissions in Senegal, like those in many developing countries, can mainly be attributed to the use of biomass for energy, land-use change and forestry, and savanna burning. Taking into account the direct global warming potential of the main GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O), Senegal's emissions are estimated at 17.6 Tg ECO2. The major gases emitted are CO2 (61% of GHG emissions), followed by CH4 (35%) and N2O (4%). Energy accounts for 45% of total emissions (12% from fossil energy and 33% from traditional biomass energy); land-use change and forests, 18%; agriculture, 24%; waste, 12%; and industry, 1%. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; fossil fuel; methane; nitrous oxide; air pollutant; air pollution; biomass; conference paper; forestry; greenhouse effect; industrial waste; land use; senegal; smoke; socioeconomics; biomass burning; deforestation; emission estimate (1991); emission inventory; greenhouse gas; land use change; savannah; Senegal",,,,,,"Brown, S. and Gaston, G.: 1995, Use of forest inventories and geographic information systems to estimate biomass density of tropical forests: application to tropical Africa.
