At the same time, the ocean is expected to warm with an associated expansion of the oxygen minimum layer (OML). Thus, there is a growing demand to understand the response of the marine biota to these global changes. We show that ocean acidification will substantially depress metabolic rates (31%) and activity levels (45%) in the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, a top predator in the Eastern Pacific. This effect is exacerbated by high temperature. Reduced aerobic and locomotory scope in warm, high-CO2 surface waters will presumably impair predator-prey interactions with cascading consequences for growth, reproduction, and survival. Moreover, as the OML shoals, squids will have to retreat to these shallower, less hospitable, waters at night to feed and repay any oxygen debt that accumulates during their diel vertical migration into the OML. Thus, we demonstrate that, in the absence of adaptation or horizontal migration, the synergism between ocean acidification, global warming, and expanding hypoxia will compress the habitable depth range of the species. These interactions may ultimately define the long-term fate of this commercially and ecologically important predator. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Global warming; Hypoxia; Jumbo or Humboldt squid; Ocean acidification; Oxygen minimum layer","carbon dioxide; article; climate; controlled study; Dosidicus gigas; greenhouse effect; marine bacterium; metabolic rate; nonhuman; predator; priority journal; squid; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Decapodiformes; Feeding Behavior; Greenhouse Effect; Oceans and Seas; Oxygen Consumption; Cephalopoda; Dosidicus gigas",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Petit, J.R., Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 429-436; Meehl, G.A., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
