We report the apparent impact of declining oxygen on midwater fishes within the OMZ of the southern California Current (CC). Principal component analysis of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) ichthyoplankton time series from 1951 to 2008 indicates that the dominant temporal pattern (principal component 1 [PC1]) represents the marked decline of the region's mesopelagic fishes during periods of reduced oxygen. Of the 27 taxa with loadings > 0.5 on PC1, 24 were mesopelagic. PC1 was strongly correlated with intermediate-water oxygen concentrations (r = 0.75, p < 0.05), which were about 20% lower in the past decade and the 1950s than in the period from 1970 to 1995. The abundance of mesopelagic fishes represented by PC1 was reduced, on average, by 63% between periods of high and low oxygen concentrations. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism is the shoaling of the hypoxic boundary layer during periods of reduced oxygen, which renders the mesopelagic fauna more vulnerable to visually orienting predators. The mesopelagic fish fauna provides a vital trophodynamic link between the marine plankton and many higher predators. The decline of deepwater fish populations has profound implications for commercial fisheries, marine food webs and marine conservation: climate models predict a 20 to 40% decline in global deepwater oxygen concentrations over the coming century. © 2011 Inter-Research.","California Current; Climate change; Mesopelagic fishes; Oxygen; Oxygen-minimum zone","abundance; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; commercial species; food web; global warming; hypoxia; mesopelagic zone; oxygen; principal component analysis; shoaling wave; time series; vulnerability; California Current; Pacific Ocean; Pisces",,,,,,"Ahlstrom, E.H., Vertical distribution of pelagic fish eggs and larvae off California and Baja California (1959) Fish Bull, 60, pp. 107-146; Andreev, A.G., Kusakabe, M., Interdecadal variability in dissolved oxygen in the intermediate water layer of the Western Subarctic Gyre and Kuril Basin (Okhotsk Sea) (2001) Geophysical Research Letters, 28 (12), pp. 2453-2456. , DOI 10.1029/2000GL012688; Bertrand, A., Bard, F.-X., Josse, E., Tuna food habits related to the micronekton distribution in French Polynesia (2002) Marine Biology, 140 (5), pp. 1023-1037. , DOI 10.1007/s00227-001-0776-3; Bertrand, A., Ballonm Chaigneau, A., Acoustic observation of living organisms reveals the upper limit of the oxygen minimum zone (2010) PLoS ONE 5, , doi: 10.1371/journal. pone.0010330; Bograd, S.J., Castro, C.G., Di Lorenzo, E., Palacios, D.M., Bailey, H., Gilly, W., Chavez, F.P., Oxygen declines and the shoaling of the hypoxic boundary in the California Current (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35, pp. L12607. , doi: 10.1029/ 2008 GL 034185; Bopp, L., Le Quéré, C., Heimann, M., Manning, A.C., Monfray, P., Climate induced oceanic oxygen fluxes: Implications for the contemporary carbon budget (2002) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 16, p. 1022. , doi: 10.1029/2001GB001445; Brodeur, R.D., Pearcy, W.G., Food habits and dietary overlap of some shelf rockfishes (genus Sebastes) from the northeastern Pacific Ocean (1984) Fishery Bulletin, 82 (2), pp. 269-293; Carpenter, J.H., The accuracy of the Winkler method for dissolved oxygen analysis (1965) Limnol Oceanogr, 10, pp. 135-140; Chan, F., Barth, J.A., Lubchenco, J., Kirincich, A., Weeks, H., Peterson, W.T., Menge, B.A., Emergence of anoxia in the California current large marine ecosystem (2008) Science, 319 (5865), p. 920. , DOI 10.1126/science.1149016; Chapman, R.P., Marshall, J.R., Reverberation from deep scattering layers in the western North Atlantic (1966) J Acoust Soc Am, 40, pp. 405-411; Checkley, D., Alheit, J., Oozeki, Y., Roy, C., (2009) Climate Change and Small Pelagic Fish, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Childress, J.J., Seibel, B.A., Life at stable low oxygen levels: Adaptations of animals to oceanic oxygen minimum layers (1998) Journal of Experimental Biology, 201 (8), pp. 1223-1232; Cohen, D.M., How many recent fishes are there?
