The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently published a report substantiating the argument that global warming is occurring. The IPCC reported that while sustainable water yields may or may not be reduced in the long-term average, they will almost certainly be less reliable in the short term. Climate change challenges existing water resources management practices by adding uncertainty. This will be an especially troubling issue for transboundary water sharing agreements. The risks imposed by climate change to transboundary water sharing agreements are discussed and the agreements most at risk are identified by the region in which they are located. © 2007 ASCE.","Climatic changes; Water policy; Water resources; Water supply","Climate change; Water resources; Water supply; Transboundary water sharing; Water policy; Water resources management; Water sharing aggreements; Water management; Climate change; Water management; Water resources; Water supply; climate change; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; water management; water planning; water resource; water supply",,,,,,"(2006) ""National Water Initiative"", , www.pmc.gov.au/water_reform/nwi.cfm, Australian Government.
