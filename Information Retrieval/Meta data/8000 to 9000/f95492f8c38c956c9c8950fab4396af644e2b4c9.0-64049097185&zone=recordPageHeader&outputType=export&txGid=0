The observed SST neither shows a clear signal of the enhanced equatorial response (EER) warming nor exhibits a clear trend of the El Niño-like warming in the last century. Similarly, the IPCC simulations show neither a clear EER warming nor an El Niño-like warming in the last century. Furthermore, the comparison of heat fluxes in model simulations of the global warming scenario and the twentieth century indicates that the aerosol cooling effect, opposite to the greenhouse gases warming effect, plays an important role in the twentieth century and explains the EER-like signal in the twentieth-century simulations. Therefore, a conclusion that the IPCC model simulations of the twentieth century are consistent with observations within the error bars as well as the future projection of the EER warming pattern in the global warming scenario are validated. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Aerosol cooling; Error bars; Future projections; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Model simulations; Sea-surface temperatures; Twentieth centuries; Warming patterns; Climatology; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Nickel compounds; Seawater; Submarine geophysics; Atmospheric temperature; aerosol; computer simulation; cooling; El Nino; future prospect; global warming; heat flux; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; observational method; sea surface temperature; trend analysis; tropical environment; twentieth century",,,,,,"Adams, J.B., Mann, M.E., Ammann, C.M., Proxy evidence for an El Niño-like response to volcanic forcing (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 274-278; Cane, M., Clement, A.C., Kaplan, A., Kushnir, Y., Pazdnyakov, D., Seager, R., Zebiak, S., Murtgudde, R., Twentieth-century sea surface temperature trends (1997) Science, 275, pp. 957-960; Collins, M., and The CMIP Modelling Groups, 2005: El Niño- or La Niña-like climate change?
