Between two major categories of zero ODP alternatives, hydrocarbons and HFCs, HFC-134a offers some advantages. It is nonflammable, widely available, and it is less expensive than other HFCs. It is an ideal choice for foam applications where nonflammability, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and blowing agent costs are major issues. Yet, HFC-134a suffers from one significant drawback - it has limited solubility in polyurethane raw materials, such as polyols. Although the issue can be alleviated by careful selection of polyols and use of coblowing agents, such as water, there is a need to further improve the system. trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene (TDCE) is a liquid at room temperature (b.p. 48°C). It has no ozone depletion potential1 (ODP), and it has very low global warming potential (GWP) because it has very short atmospheric lifetime. Previously, we found that the addition of TDCE in HFCs-based urethane foam formulations significantly improved the fire performance. In this study, we evaluated the effect of TDCE on the vapor pressure of several HFC-134a-polyol combinations. The results show that the presence of TDCE can reduce the vapor pressure of certain HFC-134a-polyol blends. More importantly, the presence of TDCE allows one to reduce the levels of HFC-134, significantly reducing the overall vapor pressure of HFC-134a-containmg systems. Finally, the presence of TDCE can dramatically reduce the viscosity of HFC-134a-polyols blends, which is important for some applications. © 2005 Sage Publications.","Foam processing; HFC-134a foam systems; Polyurethane foams; Trans-1,2-dichloroethylene; Vapor pressure polyol premixes; Viscosity polyol blends","Additives; Foams; Global warming; Molecular weight; Ozone; Polyethers; Polyurethanes; Refrigerants; Refrigerators; Stainless steel; Vapor pressure; Viscosity; Foam processing; HFC-134a foam systems; Polyurethane foams; trans-1,2-dichloroethyelene; Vapor pressure polyol premixes; Viscosity polyol blends; Ethylene",,,,,,"Rosbotham, D., Deschaght, J., Thomas, A.K., HFC-134a - A Zero ODP option for rigid polyurethane foam (1992) Polyurethane Conference Proceeding, 17; Krueger, B.C., Reichel, C.J., (1992) 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane As the Primary Blowing Agent for Rigid Polyurethane Foams Using Conventional Foam Mixing Equipment, 26; Latham, I., Factors affecting the solubility of gaseous HCFC and HFC blowing agents Polyurethanes Expo '96, p. 428. , Las Vegas, Nevada; Wu, J., Dillon, D., Eury, S., HFC-134a and HFC-365mfc in polyurethane foam applications (2003) Utech 2003, , Hague, Netherlands; Wu, J., Dillon, D., Crooker, R., Hydrochlorocarbons/pentanes coblown PIR foams for improved fire performance (2002) Polyurethanes Conference Proceeding, 144; Wu, J., Bertelo, C., Caron, L., Trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene for improving fire performance of urethane foam (2003) Polyurethanes Expo, 454; Haworth, J., Sinaga, S., Irwin, P., Latham, D., Morgan, R., New developments with appliance rigid foam systems utilizing liquid and gaseous blowing agents to achieve optimum density, flowability, cabinet energy and product appearance (1999) Polyurethanes Expo '99, 427","Wu, J.; Arkema, Inc., 900 First Avenue, King of Prussia, PA 19406, United States; email: jinhuang.wu@arkemagroup.com",,,,,,,,0021955X,,JCUPA,,"English","J Cell Plast",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-22944432170
