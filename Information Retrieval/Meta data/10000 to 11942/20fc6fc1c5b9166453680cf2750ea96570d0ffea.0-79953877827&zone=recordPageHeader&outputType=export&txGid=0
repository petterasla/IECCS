These general principles are illustrated by applying them to the case of climate change mitigation, one of the most interdisciplinary of public policy issues. The analysis shows how use of these principles leads to quite different conclusions than those of most previous such economic analyses, as follows: • The economic benefits of reducing CO 2 emissions may be about two orders of magnitude less than those estimated by most economists because the climate sensitivity factor (CSF) is much lower than assumed by the United Nations because feedback is negative rather than positive and the effects of CO 2 emissions reductions on atmospheric CO 2 appear to be short rather than long lasting. • The costs of CO 2 emissions reductions are very much higher than usually estimated because of technological and implementation problems recently identified. • Geoengineering such as solar radiation management is a controversial alternative to CO 2 emissions reductions that offers opportunities to greatly decrease these large costs, change global temperatures with far greater assurance of success, and eliminate the possibility of low probability, high consequence risks of rising temperatures, but has been largely ignored by economists. • CO 2 emissions reductions are economically unattractive since the very modest benefits remaining after the corrections for the above effects are quite unlikely to economically justify the much higher costs unless much lower cost geoengineering is used. • The risk of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming appears to be so low that it is not currently worth doing anything to try to control it, including geoengineering. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Climate change; Costs; Economic benefits; Environmental economics; Multidisciplinary; Scientific method","carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; article; atmospheric moisture; bioengineering; carbon dioxide measurement; carbon footprint; climate change; cost benefit analysis; economic evaluation; environmental economics; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; human; human activities; policy; positive feedback; public health; scientific literature; sea surface temperature; solar radiation; volcano; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Environmental Remediation",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Feynman, R., (1965) The Character of Natural Law, p. 156. , MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, USA; Crelinsten, J., (2006) Einstein's Jury: The Race to Test Relativity, , Princeton University Press: Princeton, NJ, USA; Armstrong, J.S., Green, K.C., Why the Global Warming Alarm Is an Anti-Scientific Political Movement Proceedings of the 4th Heartland Conference On Climate Change, , http://www.heartland.org/events/2010Chicago/PowerPoints/Tuesday%20-%20Session%205/Track%204%20-%20Public%20Policy/J_Scott_Armstrong.ppt, Chicago, IL, USA, 18 May 2010; Available online:, accessed on 21 December 2010; Anagnostopoulos, G.G., Koutsoyiannis, D., Christofides, A., Efstratiadis, A., Mamassis, N., A comparison of local and aggregated climate model outputs with observed data (2010) Hydrolog.
