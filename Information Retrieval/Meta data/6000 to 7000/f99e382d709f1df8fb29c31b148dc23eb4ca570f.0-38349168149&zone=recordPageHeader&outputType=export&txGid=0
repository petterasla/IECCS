Previous studies have shown that plant stress and plant vigour impact the preference and performance of many insect species. Global climate-change scenarios suggest that some regions such as continental interiors may become increasingly subject to severe drought. In combination, these two issues suggest that drought-driven plant stress may impact insect communities on a landscape scale. While there have been many population studies relating plant stress to the life history of individual herbivore species, far less is known about how plant stress affects entire communities. 2. To study the effect of plant stress on arthropod communities, arthropods were sampled from the canopies of pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) growing at sites with a history of chronically high environmental stress (e.g. lower water potentials, soil moisture, and reduced growth rates), and those growing under more favourable conditions. Sampling in these environments yielded >59 000 arthropods, representing 287 species from 14 orders and 80 families, and revealed three major community patterns. 3. First, chronic stress significantly altered community composition. Second, trees growing under high stress supported about 1/10th the number of arthropods, and roughly half the species as trees growing under more favourable conditions. Third, of the 33 abundant herbivore species that exhibited a significantly skewed distribution towards either high- or low-stress trees, 73% were skewed with higher numbers on low-stress trees. 4. The pattern of potentially reduced arthropod diversity and abundance on stressed pines observed in this study may further compound the loss of species resulting from the recent, landscape-scale drought-induced mortality of pines in the southwestern USA. © 2007 The Royal Entomological Society.","Arthropod community; Climate change; Community structure; Diversity; Pinyon pine; Plant stress; Plant vigour","arthropod; climate change; community structure; comparative study; coniferous tree; environmental stress; preference behavior; species diversity; trophic structure; Arthropoda; Hexapoda; Pinus edulis",,,,,,"Allen, C.D., Breshears, D.D., Drought-induced shift of a forest-woodland ecotone: Rapid landscape response to climate variation (1998) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 95, pp. 14839-14842; Bachelet, D., Neilson, R.P., Lenihan, J.M., Drapek, R.J., Climate change effects on vegetation distribution and carbon budget in the United States (2001) Ecosystems, 4, pp. 164-185; Betancourt, J.L., Schuster, W.S., Mitton, J.B., Anderson, R.S., Fossil and genetic history of a pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) isolate (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 1685-1697; Boege, K., Marquis, R.J., Racing herbivory as you grow up: The ontogeny of resistance in plants (2005) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 20, pp. 441-448; Breshears, D.D., Cobb, N.S., Rich, P.M., Price, K.P., Allen, C.D., Balice, R.G., Al, E., Regional vegetation die-off in response to global-change-type drought (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102, pp. 15144-15148; Brown, J.H., Whitham, T.G., Ernest, S.K.M., Gehring, C.A., Complex species interactions and the dynamics of ecological systems: Long-term experiments (2001) Science, 293, pp. 643-650; Christensen, K.M., Whitham, T.G., Impacts of insect herbivores on competition between birds and mammals for pinyon pine seeds (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 2270-2278; Cobb, N.S., Mopper, S., Gehring, C.A., Caouette, M., Christensen, K.M., Whitham, T.G., Increased moth herbivory associated with environmental stress of pinyon pine at local and regional levels (1997) Oecologia, 109, pp. 389-397; Dungey, H.S., Potts, B.M., Whitham, T.G., Li, H.F., Plant genetics affects arthropod community richness and composition: Evidence from a synthetic eucalypt hybrid population (2000) Evolution, 54, pp. 1939-1946; Gehring, C.A., Theimer, T.C., Whitham, T.G., Keim, P., Ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure of pinyon pines growing in two environmental extremes (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1562-1572; Gehring, C.A., Whitham, T.G., Comparisons of ectomycorrhiza on pinyon pines (Pinus edulis; Pinaceae) across extremes of soil type and herbivory (1994) American Journal of Botany, 81, pp. 1509-1516; Gitlin, A.R., Sthultz, C.M., Bowker, M.A., Stumpf, S., Paxton, K.L., Kennedy, K., Al, E., Mortality gradients within and among dominant plant populations as barometers of ecosystem change during extreme drought (2006) Conservation Biology, 20, pp. 1477-1486; Hanson, P.J., Weltzin, J.F., Drought disturbance from climate change: Response of United States forests (2000) Science of the Total Environment, 262, pp. 205-220; Inbar, M., Doostdar, H., Mayer, R.T., Suitability of stressed and vigorous plants to various insect herbivores (2001) Oikos, 94, pp. 228-235; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
