Results show that from 1970 to 2000, lake area increased from 1942.34 km 2 to 1979.79 km2 at a rate of 1.27 km2/a, while glacier area decreased from 167.62 km2 to 141.88 km2 at a rate of 0.86 km2/a. The increasing rate of lake in 1991-2000 was 1.76 km2/a that was faster than 1.03 km2/a in 1970-1991, while in the same period of time, the shrinking rates of glaciers were 0.97 km2/a and 0.80 km2/a respectively. Important factors, relevant to lake and glacier response to the climate, such as air temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and their values in warm and cold seasons, were discussed. The result suggests that temperature increasing is the main reason for the accelerated melting of glaciers. Lake expansion is mainly induced by the increase of the glacier melting water, increase of precipitation and obvious decrease of potential evapotranspiration. Precipitation, evaporation and their linkages with lake enlargement on regional scale need to be thoroughly studied under the background of global warming and glacier retreating. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Glacier; Lake; Nam Co Catchment; Remote sensing; Tibetan Plateau",,,,,,,"Albritton, D.L., Meira Filho, L.G., Cubasch, U., Technical summary (2001) Climate Change: The Science of Climate Change, pp. 21-83. , Houghton J T (eds.); Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Et Al., R.D., Crop evapotranspiration: Guidelines for computing crop water requirements (1998) FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper, 56. , http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e00.htm; Barry, R.G., The status of research on glaciers and global glacier recession: A review (2006) Progress in Physical Geography, 30, pp. 285-306. , 3; Bian, D., Du, J., Climate variation feature and its effect on environment change in central Tibet from 1961 to 2000 (2006) Journal of Applied Meteorological Science, 17, pp. 169-175. , 2; Bian, D., Yang, Z., Li, L., The response of lake area change to climate variations in North Tibetan Plateau during last 30 years (2006) Acta Geographica Sinica, 61, pp. 510-518. , 5; Ding, Y., Response of cryosphere to climatic warming since 1980 over the Northern Hemisphere (1996) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 18, pp. 131-137. , 2; Dorothy, K., Halla, K., Bayrb, J., Consideration of the errors inherent in mapping historical glacier positions in Austria from the ground and space (1893-2001) (2003) Remote Sensing of Environment, 86, pp. 566-577; Dyurgerov, M.B., Meier, M.F., Twentieth century climate change: Evidence from small glaciers (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 97, pp. 1406-1411. , 4; Gao, X., Tang, M., Feng, S., Discussion on the relationship between glacial fluctuation and climate change (2000) Plateau Meteorology, 19, pp. 10-19. , 1; Guan, Z., Chen, C., Qu, Y., (1984) Rivers and Lakes in Tibet, pp. 176-182. , Science Press Beijing; Harrison, S., Glasser, N., Winchester, V., A glacial lake outburst flood associated with recent mountain glacier retreat, Patagonian Andes (2006) Holocene, 16, pp. 611-620. , 4; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , IPCC.
