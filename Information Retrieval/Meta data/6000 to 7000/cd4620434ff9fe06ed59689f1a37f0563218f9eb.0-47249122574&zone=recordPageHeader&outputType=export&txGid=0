However, the N responses were dependent upon plant functional types, with significantly greater biomass increases in herbaceous than in woody species. Stimulation of plant biomass by the addition of N was enhanced when other resources were improved. In addition, the N responses of terrestrial plants decreased with increasing latitude and increased with annual precipitation. • Dependence of the N responses of terrestrial plants on biological realms, functional types, tissues, other resources, and climatic factors revealed in this study can help to explain changes in species composition, diversity, community structure and ecosystem functioning under global N enrichment. These findings are critical in improving model simulation and projection of terrestrial carbon sequestration and its feedbacks to global climate change, especially when progressive N limitation is taken into consideration. © The Authors (2008).","Biological realm; Biomass; Functional type; Latitude; Nitrogen; Plant species; Precipitation; Temperature","fertilizer; nitrogen; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; community structure; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; fertilizer application; functional group; global climate; latitude; meta-analysis; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; phytomass; plant community; precipitation intensity; article; biomass; climate; drug effect; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; meta analysis; plant; species difference; Biomass; Climate; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Plants; Species Specificity",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Fertilizers; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Chapin Iii., F.S., The mineral nutrition of wild plants (1980) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 11, pp. 233-260; Chapin Iii., F.S., Matson, P.A., Mooney, H.A., (2002) Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology.
