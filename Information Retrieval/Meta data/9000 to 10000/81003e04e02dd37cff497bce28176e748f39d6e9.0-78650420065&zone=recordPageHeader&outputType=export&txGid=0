The present paper examines issues involving emerging landmasses, maritime rights, strategic control and navigation, perhaps the most important variable, and the consequences in terms of commercial economies and geopolitical impacts. We consider many variables such as the 1982 Falkland Islands war as a demonstrative example that may have translatable impact in future years. Our purpose in this paper is to raise awareness of impending geopolitical activities that are inevitable during the 21st century as the Arctic pack ice retreats. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,"geopolitics; global warming; landownership; navigation; pack ice; sovereignty; twenty first century; Arctic; Falkland Islands (Malvinas)",,,,,,"Agoes, E.R., The law of the sea and navigation: The Indonesian archipelagic state perspective (2000) Navigational Rights and Freedoms and the New Law of the Sea, pp. 144-153. , Rothwell, D.
