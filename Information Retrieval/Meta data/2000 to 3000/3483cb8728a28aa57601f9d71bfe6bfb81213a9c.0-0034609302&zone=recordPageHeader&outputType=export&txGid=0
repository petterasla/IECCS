A wide range of scenarios for the biological response of forests to climate change are developed, ranging from small to large changes in forest growth rates. These scenarios are simulated in the economic forest sector model and results are summarized in response functions that may be used instead of rerunning the model as improved or altered biological response scenarios arise. The response functions are used to characterize broad impacts of climate change on the sector. We find that aggregate impacts (across all consumers and producers in the sector) are relatively small but that producers income and future welfare 30 to 40 yr in the future are most at risk. The forest sector is found to have adjustment mechanisms that mitigate climate change impacts, including interregional migration of production, substitution in consumption, and altered stand management.","Climate change; Response function; Sector analysis; US forest","climate change; economic impact; forest ecosystem; growth rate; United States",,,,,,"Adams, D.M., Haynes, R.W., The 1993 timber assessment market model: Structure, projections and policy simulations (1996) General Technical Report PNW-GTR-358, , USDA, Forest Service, PNW Research Station, Portland, OR; Adams, R.M., Global climate change and US agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-224. , and 9 others; Adams, D.M., Alig, R.J., McCarl, B.A., An analysis of the impacts of public timber harvest policies on private forest management in the U.S (1996) For Sci, pp. 343-358. , (1996); Adams, D.M., Alig, R.J., McCarl, B.A., Callaway, J., Winnett, S., The forest and agricultural sector optimization model: Model structure and applications (1997) Research Paper PNW-RP-495, , USDA, Forest Service, Portland, OR; Adams, R.M., Hurd, B.H., Lenhart, S., Leary, N., Effects of global climate change on agriculture: An interpretative review (1998) Clim Res, 11, pp. 19-30; Adams, R.M., Climate change and U.S. agriculture: Some further evidence (1999) Agric Resour Econ Rev Socieconomic Studies from the 1994 SOFEW Meeting, , and 8 others, General technical report, SE-92, USDA; Alig, R.J., Adams, D.M., McCarl, B.A., Impacts of incorporating land exchanges between forestry and agriculture in sector models (1998) J Agric Appl Econ, 30 (2), pp. 389-401; Burton, D., McCarl, B.A., Adams, D.M., Alig, R., Callaway, J., An exploratory study of the economic impacts of climate change on southern forests: Preliminary results (1994) Proceedings of the Southern Forest Economics Workshop, , 1994, March; Savannah, GA; Burton, D., McCarl, B.A., Adams, D.M., Alig, R., Callaway, J., Economic dimensions of climate change impacts on Southern forests (1998) The Productivity and Sustainability of Southern Forest Ecosystems in a Changing Environment, pp. 777-794. , Fox S, Mickler RA (eds) (Chap 42).
