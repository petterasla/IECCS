In this study we isolate, compare, and remove the following natural signals in observations and in climate models: dynamically induced atmospheric variability, the El Nio-Southern Oscillation, and explosive volcanic eruptions. We make clear the significant model-to-model variability in estimates of the variance in global-mean temperature associated with these natural signals, especially associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and explosive volcanic eruptions. When these natural signals are removed from time series of global-mean temperature, the statistical uncertainty in linear trends from 1950 to 2000 drops on average by about half. Hence, the results make much clearer than before where some model estimates of global warming significantly deviate from observations and where others do not. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Nickel compounds; Surface properties; Time series; Volcanoes; Anthropogenic forcing; Atmospheric variability; Global-mean temperature; Model estimates; Natural variation; Southern Oscillation; Statistical uncertainty; Surface temperatures; Twentieth century; Volcanic eruptions; Climate models; anthropogenic effect; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; signal; surface temperature; time series; twentieth century; uncertainty analysis; volcanic eruption",,,,,,"Ammann, C.M., Meehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Zender, C.S., A monthly and latitudinally varying volcanic forcing dataset in simulations of 20th century climate (2003) Geophys.
