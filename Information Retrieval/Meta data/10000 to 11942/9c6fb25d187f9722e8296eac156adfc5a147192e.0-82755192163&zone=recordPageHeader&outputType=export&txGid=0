The causation of undernutrition is complex, and there is a need to develop models that better quantify the potential impacts of climate change on population health. Objectives: We developed a model for estimating future undernutrition that accounts for food and nonfood (socioeconomic) causes and can be linked to available regional scenario data. We estimated child stunting attributable to climate change in five regions in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2050. Methods: We used current national food availability and undernutrition data to parameterize and validate a global model, using a process-driven approach based on estimations of the physiological relationship between a lack of food and stunting. We estimated stunting in 2050 using published modeled national calorie availability under two climate scenarios and a reference scenario (no climate change). Results: We estimated that climate change will lead to a relative increase in moderate stunting of 1-29% in 2050 compared with a future without climate change. Climate change will have a greater impact on rates of severe stunting, which we estimated will increase by 23% (central SSA) to 62% (South Asia). Conclusions: Climate change is likely to impair future efforts to reduce child malnutrition in South Asia and SSA, even when economic growth is taken into account. Our model suggests that to reduce and prevent future undernutrition, it is necessary to both increase food access and improve socioeconomic conditions, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","Cereal crops; Climate change; Monte carlo simulation; Quantitative model; Undernourishment; Undernutrition","Africa south of the Sahara; article; child; child nutrition; climate change; controlled study; disease severity; food analysis; food availability; geographic distribution; greenhouse gas; harvest; human; malnutrition; nutritional assessment; nutritional health; nutritional parameters; nutritional value; population research; priority journal; quantitative study; socioeconomics; South Asia; stunting; Africa South of the Sahara; Asia; Child Nutrition Disorders; Child, Preschool; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Forecasting; Growth and Development; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Socioeconomic Factors",,,,,,"Black, R.E., Allen, L.H., Bhutta, Z.A., Caulfield, L.E., de Onis, M., Ezzati, M., Maternal and child undernutrition: Global and regional exposures and health consequences (2008) Lancet, 371 (9608), pp. 243-260; Checkley, W., Buckley, G., Gilman, R.H., Assis, A.M., Guerrant, R.L., Morris, S.S., Multi-country analysis of the effects of diarrhoea on childhood stunting (2008) Int J Epidemiol, 37 (4), pp. 816-830; de Onis, M., Blossner, M., The World Health Organization Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition: Methodology and applications (2003) Int J Epidemiol, 32 (4), pp. 518-526; Easterling, W.E., Aggarwal, P.K., Batima, P., Brander, K.M., Erda, L., Howden, S.M., Food, fibre and forest products (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, pp. 273-313. , Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Parry ML, Canziani OF, Palutikof JP, van der Linden PJ, Hanson CE, eds).
