Ongoing research is being directed at materials and components investigations which have the promise of increasing the performance and reducing the cost of air conditioning systems to the point that they will realize broader application for building environmental control. This technical progress, coupled with intensive societal pressures for limiting the growth of peak electrical demand and release of global warming and ozone destruction gases, suggests that desiccant technology will experience an expanding penetration of the building air conditioning market. © 1993.",,"Buildings; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Humidity control; Dehumidification systems; Solid desiccant cooling; Air conditioning",,,,,,"Lavan, Worek, Monnier, Cooled bed solar-powered desiccant air conditioning (1981) Proc.
