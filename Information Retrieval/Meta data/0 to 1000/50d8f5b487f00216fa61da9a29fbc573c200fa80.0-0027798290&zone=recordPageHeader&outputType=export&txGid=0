Trends in rainfall were evaluated on the coastal plain to the south of 33°S and over the elevated interior to the north of 33°S. During the study period, rainfall exhibited a declining trend over the coastal plains; the elevated interior experienced a three-fold increase. Photosynthetic activity within the coastal belt declined, whereas the interior Karoo region was replenished with vegetation including savanna-type shrubs and grasses. Changes in the distribution of rainfall and vegetation may be explained by a southward shift of the sub-tropical and mid-latitude climate zones. Such a shift could become a permanent feature in the global warming scenario. -from Author",,"biomass; global warming; rainfall; savanna; South Africa, Cape Province, Karoo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,02546299,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027798290
