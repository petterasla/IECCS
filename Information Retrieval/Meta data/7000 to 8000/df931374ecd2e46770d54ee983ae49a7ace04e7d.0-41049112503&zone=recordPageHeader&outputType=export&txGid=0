An attempt has also been made to identify the relationship between SST variations over three different ocean areas, and All-India and homogeneous region summer monsoon rainfall variability, including the role of El-Niño/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Annual sea surface temperatures of the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Equatorial South India Ocean show a significant warming trend of 0.7°C, 0.6°C and 0.5°C per hundred years, respectively, and a relatively accelerated warming of 0.16°C, 0.14°C and 0.14°C per decade during the 1971-2002 period. There is a positive and statistically significant relationship between SSTs over the Arabian Sea from the preceding November to the current February, and Indian monsoon rainfall during the period 1901-2002. The correlation coefficient increases from October and peaks in December, decreasing from February to September. This significant relationship is also found in the recent period 1971-2002, whereas, during 1901-70, the relationship is not significant. On the seasonal scale, Arabian Sea winter SSTs are positively and significantly correlated with Indian monsoon rainfall, while spring SSTs have no significant positive relationship. Nino3 spring SSTs have a negative significant relationship with Indian monsoon rainfall and it is postulated that there is a combined effect of Nino3 and Arabian Sea SSTs on Indian monsoon. If the Nino3 SST effect is removed, the spring SSTs over the Arabian Sea also have a significant relationship with monsoon rainfall. Similarly, the Bay of Bengal and Equatorial South Indian Ocean spring SSTs are significantly and positively correlated with Indian monsoon rainfall after removing the Nino3 effect, and correlation values are more pronounced than for the Arabian Sea. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"air-sea interaction; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; monsoon; rainfall; sea surface temperature; summer; Arabian Sea; Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Equatorial)",,,,,,"Clark, C.O., Cole, J.E., Webster, P.J., Indian Ocean SST and Indian summer rainfall: Predictive relationships and their decadal variability (2000) J Climate, 13, pp. 2503-2519. , 10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013<2503:IOSAIS>2.0.CO;2; Dash, S.K., Shekher, M.S., Sigh, G.P., Relationship between surface fields over: 1.
