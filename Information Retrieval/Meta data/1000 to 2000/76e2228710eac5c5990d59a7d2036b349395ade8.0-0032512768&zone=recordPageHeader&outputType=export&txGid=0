Thus, it is important to determine how the character of these powerful storms could change in response to greenhouse gas-induced global warming. The impact of climate warming on hurricane intensities was investigated with a regional, high-resolution, hurricane prediction model. In a case study, 51 western Pacific storm cases under present-day climate conditions were compared with 51 storm cases under high-CO2 conditions. More idealized experiments were also performed. The large-scale initial conditions were derived from a global climate model. For a sea surface temperature warming of about 2.2°C, the simulations yielded hurricanes that were more intense by 3 to 7 meters per second (5 to 12 percent) for wind speed and 7 to 20 millibars for central surface pressure.",,"Hurricane intensities; Maximum potential intensity; Sea surface temperatures; Surface pressure; Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Storms; Hurricanes; carbon dioxide; climage change; climate change; global warming; hurriance; hurricane; air temperature; article; climate; greenhouse effect; mathematical model; priority journal; sea; Pacific",,,,,,"Emanuel, K.A., (1987) Nature, 326, p. 483; Henderson-Sellers, A., Bull.
