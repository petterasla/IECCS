We produce an inventory of UK airport emissions - including aircraft landing and takeoff (LTO) operations and airside support equipment - with uncertainties quantified. The airports studied account for more than 95% of UK air passengers in 2005. We estimate that in 2005, UK airports emitted 10.2 Gg [-23 to +29%] of NOx, 0.73 Gg [-29 to +32%] of SO2, 11.7 Gg [-42 to +77%] of CO, 1.8 Gg [-59 to +155%] of HC, 2.4 Tg [-13 to +12%] of CO2, and 0.31 Gg [-36 to +45%] of PM2.5. This translates to 2.5 Tg [-12 to +12%] CO2-eq using Global Warming Potentials for a 100-year time horizon. Uncertainty estimates were based on analysis of data from aircraft emissions measurement campaigns and analyses of aircraft operations.The First-Order Approximation (FOA3) - currently the standard approach used to estimate particulate matter emissions from aircraft - is compared to measurements and it is shown that there are discrepancies greater than an order of magnitude for 40% of cases for both organic carbon and black carbon emissions indices. Modified methods to approximate organic carbon emissions, arising from incomplete combustion and lubrication oil, and black carbon are proposed. These alterations lead to factor 8 and a 44% increase in the annual emissions estimates of black and organic carbon particulate matter, respectively, leading to a factor 3.4 increase in total PM2.5 emissions compared to the current FOA3 methodology. Our estimates of emissions are used in Part II to quantify the air quality and health impacts of UK airports, to assess mitigation options, and to estimate the impacts of a potential London airport expansion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Air quality; Airport; Aviation; Emissions; Particulate matter","Air passengers; Air quality impacts; Aircraft emissions; Airport expansions; Analysis of data; Black carbon; Black carbon emission; Carbon emissions; Carbon particulates; Climate impacts; First-order approximations; Global warming potential; Health impact; Human health; Incomplete combustion; Lubrication oil; Mitigation options; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter emissions; Political issues; Public health; Support equipments; Time horizons; UK airports; Uncertainty estimates; Air quality; Aircraft landing; Aircraft parts and equipment; Airports; Carbon dioxide; Estimation; Global warming; Health; Organic carbon; Sulfur dioxide; Uncertainty analysis; Particulate emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; organic carbon; air quality; aircraft emission; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; climate effect; global warming; health impact; particulate matter; public health; air quality; aircraft; airport; article; climate; combustion; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; health hazard; lubrication; methodology; particulate matter; politics; priority journal; United Kingdom; United Kingdom",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0",,,,"(2010), http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/about.html, Airports Council International (ACI), Airport Carbon Accreditation - Annual Report 2009-2010.
