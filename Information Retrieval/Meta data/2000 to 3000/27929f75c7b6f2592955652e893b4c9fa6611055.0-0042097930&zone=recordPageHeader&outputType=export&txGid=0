The slow drying in the desiccator caused a smooth decrease in bacterial population and diversity. Soil drying increased the relative generic abundance of actinobacteria and bacilli. The transformations identified in bacterial communities are expected to occur under natural conditions in the case of possible global warming.",,,,,,,,"Alekhina, L.K., Nevskaya, D.V., Dobrovol'skaya, T.G., Zvyagintsev, D.G., Bacterial Diversity in Forest Soils (The Succession Analysis) (1997) Mikrobiologiya, 66 (4), pp. 558-562; Golovchenko, A.V., Dobrovol'skaya, T.G., Polyanskaya, L.M., Population and Structure of Microbial Complexes in Contrasting Mesomorphic Soils under Spruce Forests in the Southern Taiga Zone (1995) Vestn.
