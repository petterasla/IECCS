Losses in these two regions totaled $127 billion, 85% of the nation's total losses. During the period 1949-2006 there were 79 hurricane catastrophes, causing $150.6 billion in losses and averaging $2.6 billion per year. All aspects of these hurricanes showed increases in post-1990 years. Sizes of loss areas averaged one state in 1949-1967, but grew to 3 states during 1990-2006. Seven of the ten most damaging hurricanes came in 2004 (4) and 2005 (3). The number of hurricanes also peaked during 1984-2006, increasing from an annual average of 1.2 during 1949-1983 to 2.1 per year. Losses were $49.3 billion in 1991-2006, 32% of the 58-year total. Various reasons have been offered for such recent increases in hurricane losses including more hurricanes, more intense tropical storms, increased societal vulnerability in storm-prone areas, and a change in climate due to global warming, although this is debatable. © pringer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Climate change; Hurricanes; Tropical storms; U.S. catastrophes","catastrophic event; climate change; hazard assessment; hurricane; severe weather; storm damage; vulnerability; North America; United States",,,,,,"Changnon, S.A., Present and future economic impacts of climate extremes in the U.S (2004) Environ Hazards, 5, pp. 47-50. , doi: 10.1016/j.hazards.2004.04.001; Changnon, S.A., Assessment of flood losses in the U.S (2008) J Contemp Water Resour Res Educ, 138, pp. 38-44; Changnon, D., Changnon, S.A., Evaluation of weather catastrophe data for use in climate change investigations (1998) Clim Change, 38, pp. 435-445. , doi: 10.1023/A:1005348112541; Changnon, S.A., Hewings, J., Losses from weather extremes in the United States (2001) Nat Hazards Rev, 2, pp. 113-123. , doi: 10.1061/(ASCE)1527-6988(2001)2:3(113); Changnon, S.A., Changnon, D., Fosse, E., Hoganson, D., Roth, R., Totsch, J., Effects of recent weather extremes on the insurance industry: Major implications for the atmospheric sciences (1997) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 78, pp. 425-435. , doi: 10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078<0425:EORWEO>2.0.CO;2; Changnon, S.A., Changnon, J., Hewings, G., Losses caused by weather and climate extremes: A national index for the U.S (2001) Phys Geogr, 22, pp. 1-27; Emanuel, K., Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years (2005) Nature, 436, pp. 686-688. , doi: 10.1038/nature03906; Emanuel, K., Sundararajan, R., Williams, J., Hurricanes and global warming: Results from downscaling IPCC AR4 simulations (2008) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 89, pp. 347-367. , doi: 10.1175/BAMS-89-3-347; (1988) The 1987-1988 Property/Casualty Fact Book, , Insurance Information Institute Insurance Institute, New York; Kunkel, K.E., Bromirski, P.D., Brooks, H.E., Cavazos, T., Douglas, A.V., Easterling, D.R., Emanuel, K.A., Smith, R.L., Observed changes in weather and climate extremes (2008) Weather and Climate Extremes in a Changing Climate, p. 143. , In: Karl TR, Meehl G, Miller C, Hassol S, Waple A, Murray W (eds) U.S. Climate Change Science Program Subcommittee on Global Change Research, Washington, DC; Landsea, C., Climate variability of tropical cyclones: Past, present and future (1999) Storms, 1, pp. 220-241. , In: Routledge Press, New York; Landsea, C., Hurricanes and global warming (2005) Nature, 438, pp. E11-E13. , doi: 10.1038/nature04477; Lecomte, E., Remarks (1993) Climate and the Insurance Industry: The Next Generation, pp. 13-18. , In: College of Insurance, New York, NY; (1999) The Costs of Natural Disasters: A Framework for Assessment, , National Research Council National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Pielke Jr., R.A., Landsea, C., Mayfield, M., Pasch, R., Hurricanes and global warming (2005) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 86, pp. 1871-1875; Pielke Jr., R.A., Gratz, J., Landsea, C., Collins, D., Saunders, M., Musulin, R., Normalized hurricane damage in the U.S.: 1900-2005 (2008) Nat Hazards Rev, 9, pp. 20-42; The catastrophe record for 2006 (2007) The Fact Book 2006: Property Casualty Insurance, , Property Claims Services In: Insurance Information Institute, New York, NY; Vecchi, G.A., Knudson, T.R., On estimates of historical North Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Activity (2008) J Clim, , (in press)","Changnon, S.A.; Illinois State Water Survey, 2204 Griffith Drive, Champaign, IL 61820, United States; email: cloudwow@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,0921030X,,,,"English","Nat.
