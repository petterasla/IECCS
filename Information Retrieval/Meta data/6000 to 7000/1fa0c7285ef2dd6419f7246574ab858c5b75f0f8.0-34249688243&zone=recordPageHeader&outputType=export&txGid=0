This paper discusses a possible substitution of an air-cycle system for a conventional vapour-compression system for transport applications. Air is a totally environmental benign working-fluid that does not lead to ozone depletion or global warming. A detailed design and performance estimation have been carried out for a high-pressure water-removal air-cycle system. In addition, a train compartment equipped with this air-cycle system has been investigated. The results show that the system is suitable for transport vessels, such as trains and ships, especially for the purpose of cooling in summer because re-using the condensed water can improve the performance of the system significantly. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
