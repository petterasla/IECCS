Fragmented forests are more prone than intact forests to periodic damage from El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) droughts, which cause elevated tree mortality, increased litterfall, shifts in plant phenology, and other ecological changes, especially near forest edges. Moreover, positive feedbacks among forest loss, fragmentation, fire, and regional climate change appear increasingly likely. Deforestation reduces plant evapotranspiration, which in turn constrains regional rainfall, increasing the vulnerability of forests to fire. Forest fragments are especially vulnerable because they have dry, fire-prone edges, are logged frequently, and often are adjoined by cattle pastures, which are burned regularly. The net result is that there may be a critical ""deforestation threshold"" above which Amazonian rainforests can no longer be sustained, particularly in relatively seasonal areas of the basin. Global warming could exacerbate this problem if it promotes drier climates or stronger ENSO droughts. Synergisms among many simultaneous environmental changes are posing unprecedented threats to Amazonian forests.",,"climate change; conservation; drought; ecological impact; habitat fragmentation; synergism; tropical forest; South America; Bos taurus",,,,,,"Ackerman, A.S., Toon, O., Stevens, D., Heymsfield, A., Ramanathan, V., Welton, E., Reduction of tropical cloudiness by soot (2000) Science, 288, pp. 1042-1047; Barbosa, R.I., Fearnside, P.M., Incêndios na Amazônia brasileira: Estimativa da emissão de gases do efeito estufa pela queima de diferentes ecossistemas de Roraima na passagem do evento ""El Niño"" (1997/98) (1999) Acta Amazonica, 29, pp. 513-534; Brown, P., Forest fires: Setting the world ablaze (1998) The Guardian [London], 20. , March; Bruner, A.G., Gullison, R.E., Rice, R.E., Fonseca, G.A.B., Effectiveness of parks in protecting tropical biodiversity (2001) Science, 291, pp. 125-128; Carvalho, G., Barros, A.C., Moutinho, P., Nepstad, D.C., Sensitive development could protect the Amazon instead of destroying it (2001) Nature, 409, p. 131; Cochrane, M.A., Synergistic interactions between habitat fragmentation and fire in evergreen tropical forests (2001) Conservation Biology, 15, pp. 1515-1521; Cochrane, M.A., Schulze, M.D., Fire as a recurrent event in tropical forests of the eastern Amazon: Effects on forest structure, biomass, and species composition (1999) Biotropica, 31, pp. 2-16; Cochrane, M.A., Alencar, A., Schulze, M.D., Souza, C.M., Nepstad, D.C., Lefebvre, P., Davidson, E., Positive feedbacks in the fire dynamics of closed canopy tropical forests (1999) Science, 284, pp. 1832-1835; Condit, R., Hubbell, S.P., Foster, R.B., Mortality rates of 205 Neotropical tree and shrub species and the impact of a severe drought (1995) Ecological Monographs, 65, pp. 419-439; Condit, R., Hubbell, S.P., Foster, R.B., Assessing the responses of plant functional types to climate change in tropical forests (1996) Journal of Vegetation Science, 7, pp. 405-416; Dale, V.H.S., Pearson, M., Offerman, H.L., O'Neill, R.V., Relating patterns of land-use change to faunal biodiversity in the central Amazon (1994) Conservation Biology, 8, pp. 1027-1036; Didham, R.K., Lawton, J.H., Edge structure determines the magnitude of changes in microclimate and vegetation structure in tropical forest fragments (1999) Biotropica, 31, pp. 17-30; Fearnside, P.M., Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon: The effect of population and land tenure (1993) Ambio, 8, pp. 537-545; Fearnside, P.M., Potential impacts of climatic change on natural forests and forestry in Brazilian Amazonia (1995) Forest Ecology and Management, 78, pp. 51-70; Fearnside, P.M., Biodiversity as an environmental service in Brazil's Amazonian forests: Risks, value and conservation (1999) Environmental Conservation, 26, pp. 305-321; Fearnside, P.M., Global warming and tropical land-use change: Greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning, decomposition and soils in forest conversion, shifting cultivation and secondary vegetation (2000) Climatic Change, 46, pp. 115-158; Ferreira, L.V., De Sá, R.M.L., Buschbacher, R., Batmanian, G., Bensuran, B.R., Costa, K.L., (1999) Areas protegidas ou espaços ameaçados?, , World Wide Fund for Nature, Brasilia; Gascon, C., Williamson, G.B., Fonseca, G.A.B., Receding edges and vanishing reserves (2000) Science, 288, pp. 1356-1358; Grace, J., Lloyd, J., McIntyre, J., Miranda, A., Meir, P., Miranda, H., Nobre, C., Gash, J., Carbon dioxide uptake by an undisturbed tropical rain forest in southwest Amazonia, 1992 to 1993 (1995) Science, 270, pp. 778-780; Houghton, R.A., Tropical deforestation and atmospheric carbon dioxide (1991) Climatic Change, 19, pp. 99-118; (1996) Climate change 1995: Impacts, adaptations and mitigation of climate change: Scientific technical analyses, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Kapos, V., Wandelli, E., Camargo, J.L., Ganade, G., Edge-related changes in environment and plant responses due to forest fragmentation in central Amazonia (1997) Tropical forest remnants: ecology, management, and conservation of fragmented communities, pp. 33-44. , W.
