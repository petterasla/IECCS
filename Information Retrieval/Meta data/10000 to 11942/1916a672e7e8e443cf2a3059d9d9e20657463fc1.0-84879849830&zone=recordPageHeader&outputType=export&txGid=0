This work aims to explore a cheap and easy way for CO2adsorption from the atmosphere, by using an eggshell membrane. Eggshell membrane could be used upto four times with intermediate regeneration with acetic acid solution. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) analysed the amount of CO2adsorbed as equivalent calcium (Ca) present in calcium carbonate (CaCO3). An average of 6824 mg CO2 could be adsorbed per g of eggshell membrane. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) was used to analyse the surface morphology of the fresh and regenerated eggshell membrane. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","adsorption; carbon dioxide; eggshell membrane",,,,,,,"DOE/NETL Report, (2005) Carbon Sequestration.
