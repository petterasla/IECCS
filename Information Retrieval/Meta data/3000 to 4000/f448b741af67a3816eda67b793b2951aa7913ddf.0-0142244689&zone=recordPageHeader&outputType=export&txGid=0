Two types of data set were used for river water temperature. One type involved five sampling points within different rivers where water temperature data were obtained daily, and the other involved 82 sampling points located within 27 rivers where water temperature and other water quality data were obtained monthly. Influential factors for different time scales were investigated. From the analyses, the gradient of water temperature to air temperature considered on a daily scale was 0·1-0·5 °C °C-1 and was influenced by the hydrological scale of the river basin. The gradient observed using an annual scale was 0·5-1·5 °C °C-1 and was supposed to be influenced by solar radiation. Under the condition that solar radiation is constant, the gradient on an annual scale was predicted to be less than unity (0·5-0·85 °C °C-1). As for the other indices, from the analysis on an annual scale, an increase in air temperature resulted in an increase in biological oxygen demand and suspended solids, and a decrease in dissolved oxygen in almost all rivers. Based on the results, it was suggested that global warming has a deteriorating effect on river water quality. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Global warming; River water quality; River water temperature; Statistical analysis","Atmospheric temperature; Oxygen; River basin projects; Rivers; Solar radiation; Statistical methods; Air temperature; Hydrology; air temperature; dissolved oxygen; global warming; river water; statistical analysis; temperature effect; water quality",,,,,,"Arai, T., (1974) Theory of Water Temperature, pp. 28-45. , Kyoritsu Press: Tokyo; (in Japanese); Avila, A., Neal, C., Terradas, J., Climate change implications for streamflow and streamwater chemistry in a Mediterranean catchment (1996) Journal of Hydrology, 177, pp. 99-116; Cruise, J.F., Limaye, A.S., Al-abed, N., Assessment of impacts of climate change on water quality in the southeastern United States (1999) Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 35, pp. 1539-1550; Erickson, T.R., Stefan, H.G., Linear air/water temperature correlations for streams during open water periods (2000) Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, 5, pp. 317-321; Fukushima, T., Ozaki, N., Kaminishi, H., Harasawa, H., Matsushige, K., Forecasting the changes in the lake water quality in response to climate change, using past relationships between meteorological conditions and water quality (2000) Hydrological Processes, 10, pp. 593-604; Hanaki, K., Takara, K., Hanazono, T., Hirakuchi, H., Kayanne, H., Impacts on hydrology/water resources and water environment (1998) The Potential Impact on Japan, pp. 131-163. , Nishioka S, Harasawa H (eds).
