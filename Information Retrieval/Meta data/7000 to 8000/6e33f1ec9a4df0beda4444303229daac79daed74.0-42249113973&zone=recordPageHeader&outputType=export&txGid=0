Many of the distributed generations are set up in the vicinity of the customer, with the advantage that this decreases transmission losses. However, output power generated from natural energy, such as wind power, photovoltaics, etc., which is distributed generation, is influenced by meteorological conditions. Therefore, when the distributed generation increases by conventional control techniques, it is expected that the voltage change of each node becomes a problem. Proposed in this paper is the optimal control of distribution voltage with coordination of distributed installations, such as the load ratio control transformer, step voltage regulator (SVR), shunt capacitor, shunt reactor, and static var compensator. In this research, SVR is assumed to be a model with tap changing where the signal is received from a central control unit. Moreover, the communication infrastructure in the supply of a distribution system is assumed to be widespread. The genetic algorithm is used to determine the operation of this control. In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulations are carried out for a distribution network model with distributed generation (photovoltaic generation). © 2008 IEEE.","Centralized control; Coordinated control; Distribution system; Genetic algorithm (GA); Voltage/reactive power control","Centralized signal control; Electric losses; Genetic algorithms; Optimal control systems; Reactive power; Voltage control; Voltage/reactive power control; Distributed power generation",,,,,,"Kabemura, K., Yonekura, K., Tsukamoto, T., Hashimoto, K., Hara, M., Application of dispersed autonomous voltage control system to a real high voltage distribution network (2004) Elect.
