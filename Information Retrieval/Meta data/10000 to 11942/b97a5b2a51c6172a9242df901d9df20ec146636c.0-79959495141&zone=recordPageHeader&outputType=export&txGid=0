Anadromous fishery managers will need advice from models of phenology, or migratory timing, as functions of environmental factors in those harvest areas where annual migratory timing can vary sharply. Such models are also necessary to advise fishery managers on how and when global warming projections of the IPCC model ensemble should be factored into regulatory decisions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the annual timing of marine exit of Yukon River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at 63°N 165°W for 19612009 varied in close concert with modelled sea surface temperature, air temperature, and sea ice cover. The best linear model for 19612009 combines sea surface and air temperatures to explain 59 of the annual variability in migratory timing (ice cover is available only for 19702009). Changes in phenology of high-latitude Chinook salmon are expected in response to global warming. As average temperatures increase, the frequency of earlier migrations is expected to increase, making management of the fishery more challenging. © 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","air temperature; anadromous; Chinook salmon; climate change; fishery management; IPCC climate forecasts; migratory timing; NCEP reanalysis; phenology; sea ice cover; sea surface temperature; Yukon River","air temperature; climate change; environmental factor; global warming; ice cover; migratory population; phenology; salmonid fishery; sea surface temperature; water temperature; Yukon River; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",,,,,,"Anderson, J.J., Beer, W.N., Oceanic riverine, and genetic influences on spring Chinook salmon migration timing (2009) Ecological Applications, 19, pp. 1989-2003; Anisimov, O.A., Vaughan, D.G., Callaghan, T.V., Furgal, C., Marchant, H., Prowse, T.D., Vilhjálmsson, H., Polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic) (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, pp. 653-685. , Ed. by M.
