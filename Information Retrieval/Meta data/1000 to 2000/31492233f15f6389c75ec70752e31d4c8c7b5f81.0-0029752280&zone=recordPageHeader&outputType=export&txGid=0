Four climate change scenarios were evaluated (baseline, GISS, GFDL, and UKMO). The complete impact of climatic changes in the Nile cannot be fully predicted with confidence, as some models forecast increased flows, while others project significant decreases. However, it was observed that the Nile River flow is extremely sensitive to ambient temperature and pre-cipitation changes, and it is possible that the effects of climatic fluctuations would be severe. Several water management options were identified to help adapt Nile River management to a changing global climate.","Climate change; Egypt; Nile; Potential adjustments; Water balance model(s); Water resources","climate change; global climate change; river basin management; water balance model; water resource; water resources; Egypt, Nile Basin; Egypt, Nile River",,,,,,"Chan, S., Eagleson, P., Water balance of the Bahr El Ghazel swamps (1980) Technical Report No. 261, , Ralph M Parsons Laboratory, MIT, Cambridge; Conway, D., Hulme, M., Recent fluctuations in precipitation and runoff over the Nile sub-basins and their impact on main Nile discharge (1993) Clim Change, 25, pp. 127-151; Gleick, P.H., The development and testing of a water balance model for climate impact assessment: Modeling the Sacramento Basin (1987) Wat Resour Res, 23 (6), pp. 1049-1061; Gleick, P.H., The vulnerability of runoff in the Nile Basin to climate changes (1991) Environ Prof, 13, pp. 66-73; Gleick, P.H., Vulnerability of runoff in the Nile Basin to climatic changes (1992) Climatic Fluctuations and Water Management, pp. 125-128. , Abu Zeid MA, Biswas AK (eds) Butterworth-Heinemann; Hansen, J., Russell, G., Rind, D., Stone, P., Lacis, A., Lebedoff, S., Ruedy, R., Travis, L., Efficient three-dimensional global models for climate studies: Models I and II (1983) Mon Weather Rev, 111, pp. 609-662; Hulme, M., Recent and future precipitation changes over the Nile Basin (1992) Climatic Fluctuations and Water Management, pp. 187-201. , Abu Zeid MA, Biswas AK (eds) Butterworth-Heinemann; Iskandar, I., Drought and management of water resources in the Sudan (1989) International Seminar on Climatic Fluctuations and Water Management, , Paper presented 11-14 December 1989, Cairo, Egypt; Kalinin, G.P., (1971) Global Hydrology, , US Dept of Commerce, NTIS, Springfield (translated from Russian, Israel Program for Scientific Translation Ltd); Lema, A.J., East African climate over the last one hundred years (1880-1980) (1989) International Seminar on Climatic Fluctuations and Water Management, , Paper presented 11-14 December 1989, Cairo, Egypt; Manabe, S., Wetherald, R.T., Large-scale changes in soil wetness induced by an increase in carbon dioxide (1987) J Atmos Sci, 44, pp. 1211-1235; Mitchell, J.F.B., Senior, C.A., Ingram, W.J., CO2 and climate: A missing feedback (1989) Nature, 341, pp. 132-134; Oliver, J., Problems of determining evapotranspiration in the semi-arid tropics illustrated with reference to the Sudan (1969) J Trop Geogr, 29 (1), pp. 64-74; Piper, B.S., Plinston, D.T., Sutcliffe, J.V., The water balance of Lake Victoria (1986) Hydrol Sci J, 31, pp. 25-37; Sestini, G., Implications of climatic changes for the Nile Delta (1993) Climatic Change in the Mediterranean, pp. 535-601. , Sestini G (ed) E.
