Because subtidal and offshore coastal marine communities are not easily observed, their deterioration often goes mostly unnoticed. Impacts from stresses on coastal marine communities are manifested at the individual species level, but magnify in effect throughout the entire ecosystem because of complex inter-connected relationships between species at different trophic levels, including interactions such as predation, competition and mutualism. Therefore, one lost species or group of species may have unpredictable direct or indirect consequences through secondary effects on the ecosystem, possibly leading to the loss of a few to many species. Rather than striving to maintain some specific level of diversity, we should endeavour to understand the basic ecological proceses that control populations, communities and ecosystems so we can best predict what kinds of stresses will cause the most serious alterations to the system and avoid them. We should be conservative about protecting systems even before we understand the procesess fully. -from Author",,"anthropogenic impact; biodiversity; coastal ecosystems; community structure; conservation; habitat loss; human activity; introduced species; marine ecosystem; pollution; species diversity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00031569,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028552101
