Box 458, GR 54124 Thessaloniki, Greece","This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the direct application of cottonseed oil-diesel blends as fuel for diesel engine vehicles without using additional retrofit mechanical systems. The use of biofuels is one of the main actions promoted by the European Union and member states in an effort to tackle global warming, enhance energy security and contribute to regional development. Here, the possibility to blend cottonseed oil directly with fossil diesel as a fuel for diesel engines is examined. This option has lower cost and larger well-to-wheel greenhouse gas benefits than fatty acid methylesters. The paper presents measurements of important fuel properties, density, viscosity, cetane number and cold flow characteristics. In addition, a common rail Euro 3 compliant diesel car is tested using 10% v/v cottonseed oil-diesel blends in order to examine the effects on performance and emissions of regulated pollutants and CO2. Furthermore, particle emission characteristics are studied, including total and solid particle number concentrations and particle size distributions over driving cycles and steady state modes. The results indicate that the test fuel presents good operating characteristics and limited effects on regulated emissions and vehicle performance. These results would justify further research on the direct use of vegetable oils as automotive fuels. © 2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Biofuels; Cottonseed oil; Exhaust emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions","Cost effectiveness; Cottonseed oil; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Retrofitting; Exhaust emissions; Fossil diesel; Greenhouse gas emissions; Biofuels; Gossypium hirsutum; Micropus",,,,,,"André, M., The ARTEMIS European driving cycles for measuring car pollutant emissions (2004) Science of the Total Environment, 334-335, pp. 73-84; Bauer, H., Dietsche, K.H., Jager, T., (2004) Diesel Engine Management, , Robert Bosch GmbH, Automotive Aftermarket Division, Germany; (2006) Biofuels in the European Union, a vision for 2030 and beyond, , http://ec.europa.eu/ research/energy/nn/nn_rt/nn_rt_bm/article_4012_en.htm, Biofuels Research Advisory Council BIOFRAC, available at; (2001) Sampling automotive exhaust with a thermodenuder, Dekati, , Dekati Ltd, technical note; (2003) Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport, , http://ec.europa.eu/energy/res/legislation/biofuels_en.htm, European Commission EC, available at; Fontaras, G., Mamakos, A., Ntziachristos, L., Miltsios, G., Samaras, Z., Evaluation of cottonseed oil-diesel fuel blends as fuel for automotive diesel engines (2006) Fisita World Automotive Congress Yokohama Japan, , Fisita technical paper number F2006P380; Forson, F., Oduro, E., Donkoh, E., Performance of jatropha oil blends in a diesel engine (2004) Renewable Energy, 29, pp. 1135-1145; Giannelos, P.N., Sxizas, S., Lois, E., Zannikos, F., Anastopoulos, G., Physical, chemical and fuel related properties of tomato seed oil for evaluating its direct use in diesel engines (2005) Industrial Crops and Products, 22 (3), pp. 193-199; Giechaskiel, B., Ntziachristos, L., Samaras, Z., Calibration and modelling of ejector dilutors for automotive exhaust sampling (2004) Measurement Science and Technology, 15, pp. 1-8; Graboski, M., McCormick, R.L., Combustion of fat and vegetable oil derived fuels in diesel engines (1998) Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 24 (2), pp. 125-164; He, Y., Bao, Y., Study on cottonseed oil as a partial substitute for diesel oil in fuel for single cylinder diesel engine, Technical note (2005) Renewable Energy, 30, pp. 805-813; (2004) Biofuels for transport: An international perspective, , http://www.iea.org/textbase/ nppdf/free/2004/biofuels2004.pdf, International Energy Agency IEA, Paris, downloaded from; Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP), 2005, Road transport fuels in Europe: the explosion of demand for diesel fuel, downloaded from: http://www.ifp.fr/ IFP/en/files/cinfo/IFP-Panorama05_10CarburantsRoutiersVA.pdfMarjamäki, M., Ntziachristos, L., Virtanen, A., Ristimäki, J., Keskinen, J., Moiso, M., Palonen, M., Lappi, M., (2002) Electrical filter stage for the ELPI, , SAE paper 2002-01-0055; Pundir, B.P., Singal, S.K., Gondal, A.K., Diesel fuel quality: Engine performance and emissions (1994) SAE Technical Paper Series, , Paper No 942020; Rakopoulos, C.D., Antonopoulos, K.A., Rakopoulos, D.C., Hountalas, D.T., Giakoumis, E.G., Comparative performance and emissions study of a direct injection diesel engine using blends of diesel fuel with vegetable oils or bio-diesels of various origins (2006) Energy Conversion and Management, 47 (18-19), pp. 3272-3287; Ramadhas, A., Jayaraj, S., Muraleedharan, C., Characterization and effect of using rubber seed oil as fuel in the compression ignition engines, Technical note (2005) Renewable Energy, 30, pp. 795-803; Virtanen, A., Marjamäki, M., Ristimäki, J., Keskinen, J., Fine particle losses in electrical low-pressure impactor (2001) Journal of Aerosol Science, 32, pp. 389-401; Zaher, F.A., Megahed, O.A., El Kinawy, O.S., Utilization of used frying oil as diesel engine fuel (2003) Energy Sources, 25, pp. 819-826","Samaras, Z.; Laboratory of Applied Thermodynamics, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, P.O.
