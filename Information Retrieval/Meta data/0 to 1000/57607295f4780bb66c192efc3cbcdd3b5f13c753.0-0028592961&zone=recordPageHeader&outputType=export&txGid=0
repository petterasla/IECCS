Using PPP-adjusted GDP also shows that the larger developing countries of the world are not, when viewed overall, less energy-efficient than their industrialized country counterparts. The per capita GDPs of the larger developing countries are typically about 1/10 to 1/4 of those of the O.E.C.D. countries, on a PPP-adjusted basis, rather than in the range of 1/80 to 1/10 on an MER-basis. This result may have major implications for future energy requirements of the developing countries, associated emissions of CO2, and formulation of policies for addressing global climate change. © 1994.",,"carbon dioxide emission; climate change; energy; purchasing power parity; Air pollution; Climatology; Correlation methods; Developing countries; Economics; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Climate change policies; Gross national product; Market exchange rates; Purchasing power parity; Energy utilization",,,,,,"World Bank, (1992) World Bank Atlas, , World Bank, Washington, DC; Daly, Cobb, (1989) For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future, , Beacon Press, Boston, MA; Haq, (1992) Choices: The Human Development Magazine, 1, p. 26; United Nations Development Programme, (1993) Human Development Report, , Oxford Univ.
