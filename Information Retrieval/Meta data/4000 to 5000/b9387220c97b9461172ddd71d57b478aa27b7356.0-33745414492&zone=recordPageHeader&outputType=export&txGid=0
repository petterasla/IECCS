Biogas can be obtained from digesting the organic material of municipal solid wastes (MSW). The composition of MSW varies by the source of waste; however, in all cases the major constituents of MSW are organic in nature and the organics account for more than 50% of MSW. The main constituents of landfill gas are methane and carbon dioxide, both of which are major contributors to global warming. The generation of methane is worthwhile after one year from the start of the landfill operation. The compositional characteristics of MSW vary considerably from the large cities to the small towns and regions in Turkey. The social and demographic factors for each region are very different.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Landfill; Solid waste","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Land fill; Methane; Organic compounds; Solid wastes; Landfill gas; Municipal landfills; Municipal solid waste; Biogas",,,,,,"Akinbami, J.-F.K., Ilori, M.O., Oyebisi, T.O., Akinwumi, I.O., Adeoti, O., Biogas energy use in Nigeria: Current status, future prospects and policy implications (2001) Renew.
