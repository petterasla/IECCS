However, on this issue, problems of valuation, risk and uncertainty, time-discounting, and equity make cost-benefit analysis so inconclusive and controversial that - far from helping decision-making - it is likely to hinder it. An alternative approach involves accepting that climate stability has to be secured on the grounds of environmental sustainability, and determining in principle to undertake the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions that is necessary to achieve this. The timetable of such abatement will obviously depend to some extent on its costs. The evidence on abatement costs suggests that a, 20 percent abatement from 1990 levels of carbon dioxide (the principal greenhouse gas) can be achieved in industrial countries at low or no cost by 2010. Application of the sustainability principle suggests that this is a reasonable first target. If deeper cuts in emissions are deemed necessary thereafter, they will be achieved more easily and at lower cost than if abatement in the interim is negligible.",,"cost-benefit analysis; economic evaluation; environmental economics; global warming",,,,,,"Fankhauser, S., Protection vs. Retreat: Estimating the Costs of Sea-Level Rise (1994) CSERGE Working Paper GEC 94-02, , London: CSERGE, University College London; CSERGE Working Paper GEC 94-02, p. 27; CSERGE Working Paper GEC 94-02, p. 32; Hope, C., Anderson, J., Wenman, P., Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect: An Application of the PAGE Model (1993) Energy Policy, 21 (3), pp. 327-338. , March; Fankhauser, S., (1995) Valuing Climate Change: The Economics of the Greenhouse Effect, , London: Earthscan; Cline, W.R., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Washington, D.C.: Institute for International Economics; Cline, The Economics of Global Warming, p. 119; Fankhauser, Valuing Climate Change, p. 51; Rosenzweig, C., (1993) Climate Change and World Food Supply, p. 15. , Oxford: Environmental Change Unit, Table 9; Cline, The Economics of Global Warming, p. 99; (1994) World Resources, 1994-95, p. 108. , Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, Table 6.1; Brown, L., (1993) State of the World 1993, pp. 11-14. , London: Earthscan; Cline, The Economics of Global Warming, p. 87. , note 9; Fankhauser, Valuing Climate Change, p. 47. , Table 3.11; Cline, The Economics of Global Warming, p. 36; Fankhauser, Valuing Climate Change, p. 47; Valuing Climate Change, p. 47; Lockwood, B., The Social Costs of Electricity Generation (1992) CSERGE Discussion Paper GEC 92-09, p. 70. , Norwich: Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, University of East Anglia, note 3; Hohmeyer, O., Gärtner, M., (1992) The Costs of Climate Change, , Report to the Commission of the European Communities Karlsruhe, Germany: Fraunhofer Institut für Systemtechnik und Innovations-Forschung; Cline, The Economics of Global Warming, p. 300; Broome, J., (1992) Counting the Cost of Global Warming, p. 108. , Cambridge: White Horse Press; Cline, The Economics of Global Warming, p. 239; Nordhaus, W., To Slow or Not to Slow: The Economics of the Greenhouse Effect (1991) Economic Journal, 101, p. 934. , July; Nordhaus, The 'DICE' Model: Background and Structure of a Dynamic Integrated Climate-Energy Model of the Economics of Global Warming (1992) Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper No. 1009, 1009, p. 15. , New Haven, Conn.: Yale University, February; Nordhaus, Rolling the 'DICE': An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling Greenhouse Gases (1993) Resource and Energy Economics, 15 (1), p. 37. , March; Birdsall, N., Steer, A., Act Now on Global Warming: But Don't Cook the Books (1993) Finance and Development, p. 8. , March; (1992) World Resources, 1992-93, p. 206. , Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, and Figure 13.1; World Resources, 1994-95, p. 363. , Table 23.1; Pearce, D., (1983) Cost-Benefit Analysis, p. 21. , London: Macmillan; Fankhauser, S., Global Warming Economics: Issues and State of the Art (1993) CSERGE Working Paper GEC 93-28, p. 22. , London: Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, University College; Gaskins, D.W., Weyant, J.P., Model Comparisons of the Costs of Reducing CO2 Emissions (1993) American Economic Review, AEA Papers and Proceedings, 83 (2), p. 320. , May; Ekins, P., Rethinking the Costs of Global Warming: A Survey of the Issues (1995) Environmental and Resource Economics, 5, pp. 1-47; Jorgenson, D.W., Wilcoxen, P.J., Energy, the Environment, and Economic Growth (1993) Handbook of Natural Resource and Energy Economics, 3, p. 1327. , ed.
