These scenarios based on IPCC's 21st century emission scenarios that combine a variety of assumptions about demographic, economic and technological driving forces likely to influence such emissions in the future, were used as input to a crop model to predict the impact of climate change on wheat yield at a location in south-eastern Australia. At this locality there are important likely changes in the primary climatic variables of temperature, rainfall and solar radiation. Generally, we found a strong and consistent positive trend in mean diurnal temperature range, followed by a significant negative trend in wheat yield under three climate scenarios with and without elevated CO2 concentration. It is possible that negative trends identified over the future decades may be artefacts of the method of substituting historical variance for future variance. We observed that from present climate to projected low, mid and high global warming scenarios, median wheat yield may decrease by about 29%. Under these scenarios, but with an elevated atmospheric CO2 climate, median wheat yield may decrease by about 25%. The effect of elevated CO2 reduces the severity of the warmer air temperatures and lower rainfall but the effect is small (4%). Advances in agronomy and breeding must boost crop yields by around 25% over the coming decades, to keep in step with predicted climate change. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
