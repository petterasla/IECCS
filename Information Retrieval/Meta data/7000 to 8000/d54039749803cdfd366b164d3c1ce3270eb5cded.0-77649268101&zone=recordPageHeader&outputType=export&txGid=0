Such subsidies have received little attention in economic and environmental research, even though they may be at least as important from an environmental perspective as on-budget subsidies. We offer a typology of indirect subsidies. Next, we estimate the magnitude of these subsidies and their impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) and acidifying emissions for the agriculture, energy, and transport sectors in The Netherlands. The calculations are based on a model approach that translates a particular subsidy into price and quantity changes using empirical elasticities, followed by environmental effect estimates using pollutionintensity parameters. The various environmental pollution effects are aggregated into environmental indicators. The results show, among others, that GHG emissions caused by off-budget subsidies contribute to more than 30% of the policy targets specified by the Kyoto Protocol for CO2 emissions reduction by The Netherlands. Reforming or removing off-budget subsidies may thus be an important strategy of effective climate policy. © 2009 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",,"carbon dioxide; acidification; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; cost-benefit analysis; empirical analysis; environmental economics; environmental effect; environmental impact; environmental modeling; environmental planning; environmental policy; global warming; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; state role; subsidy system; typology; agriculture; article; economics; environment; financial management; greenhouse effect; health; human; Netherlands; organization and management; policy; pollution; risk factor; traffic and transport; greenhouse effect; pollution; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Environment; Environmental Pollution; Financing, Government; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Netherlands; Private Sector; Public Policy; Public Sector; Risk Factors; Transportation; World Health; Netherlands; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Environment; Environmental Pollution; Financing, Government; Global Health; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Netherlands; Private Sector; Public Policy; Public Sector; Risk Factors; Transportation",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Carbon Dioxide",,,,"Myers, N., Lifting the veil on perverse subsidies (1998) Nature, 392, pp. 327-328; James, A.N., Gaston, K.J., Balmford, A., Balancing the Earth's accounts (1999) Nature, 401, pp. 323-324; Perry, I., A second-best analysis of environmental subsidies (1998) Int.
