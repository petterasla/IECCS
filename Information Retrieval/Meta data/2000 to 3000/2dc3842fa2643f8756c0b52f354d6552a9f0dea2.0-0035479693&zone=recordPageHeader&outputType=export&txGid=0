A new study by Tilman et al. highlights the threat posed to natural ecosystems worldwide by increasing agricultural development. Over the next 50 years, model projections suggest that rates of habitat destruction, water consumption and emission of agricultural pollutants will increase drastically. Such changes will be greatest in developing nations, which sustain a disproportionately large fraction of the Earth's biological diversity.",,"agricultural chemical; nitrogen; phosphorus; agricultural development; ecosystem function; environmental impact; global change; human activity; agriculture; biodiversity; destruction; developing country; ecosystem; fluid intake; global climate; pollution; short survey",,,,,,"Tilman, D., Forecasting agriculturally driven global environmental change (2001) Science, 292, pp. 281-284; Ehrlich, P.R., (1995) The Stork and the Plow, , Yale University Press; (1999) World Population Prospects: the 1998 Revision, , United Nations Dept of Economic and Social Affairs; Maddison, A., (1995) Monitoring the World Economy, 1820-1992, , Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; (1999) Our Common Journey: a Transition Toward Sustainability, , National Academy Press; Vitousek, P., Human appropriation of the products of photosynthesis (1986) BioScience, 36, pp. 368-373; Houghton, J.T., (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press; Vitousek, P.M., Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle: Sources and consequences (1994) Ecol.
