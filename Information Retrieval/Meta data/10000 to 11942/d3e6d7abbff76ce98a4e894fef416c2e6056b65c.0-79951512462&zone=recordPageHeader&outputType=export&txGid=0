In this context, this paper investigates the significance of behavioural, physical and socio-economic parameters on cooling energy in order to improve energy efficiency in residential buildings. It demonstrates that such factors exert a significant indirect as well as direct influence on energy use, showing that it is particularly important to understand indirect relationships. An initial study of direct factors affecting cooling energy reveals that occupant behaviour is the most significant issue (related to choices about how often and where air conditioning is used). This is broadly confirmed by path analysis, although climate is seen to be the single most significant parameter, followed by behavioural issues, key physical parameters (e.g. air conditioning type), and finally socio-economic aspects (e.g. household income). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Air conditioning; Building energy consumption; Domestic cooling energy; Global warming; Occupant behaviour","Building energy consumption; Cooling energy; Cooling energy consumption; Current trends; Domestic cooling energy; Energy use; Household income; Occupant behaviour; Path analysis; Physical parameters; Residential building; Residential sectors; Socio-economic factor; Socio-economics; Socioeconomic aspects; Air conditioning; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Regression analysis; Energy utilization; air conditioning; building; cooling; energy use; global warming; physicochemical property; socioeconomic conditions",,,,,,"(2008), International Energy Agency.
