This study sought to determine local-scale accuracy of SOGS data (1) by correlation with independent, in situ weather station measurements and (2) relative to a nearby weather station. Correlations between SOGS data and in situ weather observations and between in situ weather observations and a nearby weather station were examined in a semiarid environment of southeastern Idaho over the 2006 growing season. The results indicate that both SOGS and nearby weather station data were significantly correlated with in situ weather station measurements. Although temperature correlations between in situ and the nearby weather station were slightly greater compared to SOGS, SOGS data were a better predictor of precipitation. This suggests that the use of a nearby weather station is appropriate for local temperature parameters but precipitation parameters are better estimated using SOGS data. Overall, the validation of the SOGS weather models agreed closely with independent, in situ weather measurements and, as a result, greater confidence can be placed in the accuracy of the productivity, biomass and global climate change models derived from these data. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",,"Continuous models; Global climate changes; Gridding; Growing season; In-situ; Local temperature; Meteorological condition; Scale validation; Semi-arid environments; Site-specific; Surface observation; Temperature correlation; Weather models; Weather observations; Weather stations; Climate change; Climate models; Weather information services; climate change; data processing; in situ measurement; precipitation (climatology); remote sensing; semiarid region; temperature effect",,,,,,"Barnsley, M.J., Hobson, P.D., Hyman, A.H., Lucht, W., Muller, J.P., Strahler, A.H., Characterizing the spatial variability of broadband albedo in a semidesert environment for MODIS validation (2000) Remote Sensing of Environment, 74, pp. 58-68; Berry, J., Bjorkman, O., Photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants (1980) Annual Review of Plant Physiology, 31, pp. 491-543; Bounoua, L., Collatz, G.J., Tucker, C.J., Sellers, P.J., Randall, D.A., Dazlich, D.A., Jensen, T.G., Fung, I., Interactions between vegetation and climate: Radiative and physiological effects of doubled atmospheric CO2 (1999) Journal of Climate, 12, pp. 309-324; Davis, (2006) Derived Variables in Davis Weather Products, , Application note 28 (Hayward, CA: Davis Corporation); Freund, J.E., Simon, G.A., (1991) Statistics: A First Course, , 5th edn (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall); Gauch Jr., H.G., Hwang, J.T.G., Fick, G.W., Model evaluation by comparison of model-based predictions and measured values (2003) Agronomy Journal, 95, pp. 1442-1446; Heinsch, F.A., Zhao, M., Running, S.W., Kimball, J.S., Nemani, R.R., Davis, K.J., Bolstad, P.V., Flanagan, L.B., Evaluation of remote sensing based terrestrial productivity from MODIS using regional tower eddy flux network observations (2006) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 44, pp. 1908-1925; Huemmrich, K.F., Privette, J.L., Mukelabai, M., Myneni, R.B., Knyazikhin, Y., Time-series validation of MODIS land biophysical products in a Kalahari woodland, Africa (2005) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 26, pp. 4381-4398; Jensen, M.E., Burman, R.D., Allen, R.G., Evapotranspiration and Irrigation Water Requirements (1990) ASCE Manuals and Reports on Engineering Practice, No. 70, p. 360. , New York: American Society of Civil Engineers; Jolly, W.M., Graham, J.M., Michaelis, A., Nemani, R., Running, S.W., A flexible, integrated system for generating meteorological surfaces derived from point sources across multiple geographic scales (2005) Environmental Modelling and Software, 20, pp. 873-882; Liang, S., Fang, H., Cheng, M., Shuey, C.J., Walthall, C., Daughtry, C., Morisette, J., Strahler, A., Validating MODIS land surface reflectance and albedo products: Methods and preliminary results (2002) Remote Sensing of Environment, 83, pp. 149-162; Minnett, P.J., Evans, R.H., Kearns, E.J., Brown, O.B., Sea-surface temperature measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (2002) Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2002.
