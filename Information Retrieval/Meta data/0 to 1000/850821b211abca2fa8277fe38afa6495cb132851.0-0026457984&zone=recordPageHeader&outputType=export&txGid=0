Hall, London, United Kingdom","Biomass in all its form currently provides about 14% of the world's energy, equivalent to 25 million bbl oil/day; in developing countries where it is the major energy source, biomass supplies 35% of total energy use. Although biomass energy use affects the flux of carbon to the atmosphere, the main carbon emission problem is caused by fossil fuels and land clearance for agriculture. Biomass fuels make no net contribution to atmospheric CO2 if used sustainably. A major global revegetation and reforestation effort is a possible strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and to slow the pace of climatic change. However, a more attractive alternative strategy might be to substitute fossil fuels, especially coal, with biomass grown specifically for this purpose producing modern fuels such as electricity, liquids and gases. This paper examines biomass energy use, devegetation, biomass burning, the implications for global warming and the ability of biomass to sequester CO2 and substitute for fossil fuels. It also discusses some socioeconomic and political issues. © 1992.","Biomass energy; CO2 sequestration; Coal substitution","biomass; biomass energy; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide emissions; coal substitution; emission control; energy; energy source; fuel substitution; global warming; reforestation",,,,,,"There are four principal ways in which biomass is used as an energy source: 1, as fuel directly for cooking, space heating and process heat; 2) as a fuel for local power generation usually via steam; 3) gasification (biological and thermochemical) for use on site or transported by pipeline to the final consumer for heating or power generation; 4) conversion into a liquid fuel for transportation or other motive applicationsScurlock, Hall, The contribution of biomass to global energy use (1990) Biomass, 21, pp. 75-81; Hall, Biomass energy (1991) Energy Policy, 19 (8), pp. 711-737; Hall, Rosillo-Calle, Why biomass matters: energy and environment (1991) Network News, 5. , Biomass Users Network (BUN), San Jose, Costa Rica, It is difficult to give accurate figures about the use of biomass since: a, there is a considerable lack of detailed knowledge regarding supply and use of biomass energy; b) it is difficult to analyse because of the diversity in the nature of supply and consumption patterns of biomass energy among and within countries; c) unlike modern fuels, bioenergy production and use is highly decentralized which does not facilitate monitoring and planning. For example, fuelwood consumption reported by the FAO tends to be considerably underestimated because no accurate records are kept in many countries and because the data available are at best estimates or extrapolations based on partial consumption studies, eg, see; Openshaw, Woodfuel — a time for reassessment (1980) Energy in the Developing World. The Real Energy Crisis, pp. 72-86. , V. Smil, E. Knowland, Oxford University Press; Montalembert, Clement, Fuelwood Supplies in the Developing Countries (1983) FAO Forestry Paper 42, , Office of Policy, Planning and Evaluation, EPA, Rome, Unfortunately this type of data is still widely quoted as a single source even though it is acknowledged as being inaccurate. In Table 1 we provide an alternative set of estimates as well as those of the FAO; Hall, Rosillo-Calle, Why biomass matters: energy and environment (1991) Network News, 5. , Biomass Users Network (BUN), San Jose, Costa Rica, No 4; Lashof, Tirpack, (1990) Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate, , Office of Policy, Planning and Evaluation, EPA, Washington, DC, USA; It needs to be noted that the use of biomass is diversified amongst the so-called six ‘F’ fields, namely: food, fuel, feed, fibre, feedstock, and fertilizer. In many cases, these uses can conflict in both production and use, thus requiring careful planning and continuous adjustments in local use patternsCarpentieri, An Assessment of Sustainable Bioenergy in Brazil: National Overview and Case Study for the Northeast (1991) PU/CEES Working Paper No 119, , Princeton University, NJ, USA; IbidPasztor, Kristoferson, (1990) Bioenergy and the Environment, , Westview Press, Boulder, CO, USA; Smith, The biofuel transition (1987) Pacific and Asian Journal of Energy, 1, pp. 13-31; Smith, Ahuja, Toward a greenhouse equivalent index: the total exposure analogy (1990) Climatic Change, 17, pp. 1-7; Hall, Rosillo-Calle, African Forests and Grasslands: Sources or Sinks of Greenhouse Gases?

Juma, ACTS Press, Nairobi; Myers, (1989) Deforestation Rates in Tropical Forests and Their Climatic Implications, , Earthscan Publications, London, UK; For example, in the Brazilian Amazon region alone, different estimates put the total deforested area from the 1970s at between 25 million ha and 60 million ha (5.12 to 12% of land area respectively) or between 2 and 8 million ha annually.

Pearce et al., Earthscan Publications, London, UK; It is estimated that since the 1970s about 5 million ha in the Brazilian Amazon have been converted to pasture and will be subject to further degradation and in addition a further 5 million ha are already degraded pasture lands.

The net flow is unknown because net primary production regrowth, and losses due to overgrazing and erosion are largely unknown. These calculations are based on the estimates of above ground standing biomass which was monitored monthly in addition to below ground biomass and net primary productivity (NPP) from turnover data.

Their result demonstrates a stronger impact of deforestration which can cause significant local climatic peturbations; Hall, Carbon flows in the biosphere: present and future (1989) Journal of the Geological Society, 146, pp. 175-181; G.M.
