It presents tabulated global warming potentials and other environmental data for candidate refrigerants. The paper discusses briefly the historic progression in refrigerant release reductions and presents analyses to compare the efficiencies of historic and current refrigerant options. The 28 refrigerants addressed include chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), hydrocarbon (HC), and inorganic (such as ammonia) fluids. The paper discusses the relative importance of the refrigerant-related and energy-related components of chiller emissions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.","Air conditioning; Chiller; Comparison; Efficiency; Global warming; Survey","Ammonia; Chlorofluorocarbons; Gas emissions; Global warming; Hydrocarbons; Refrigerants; Chiller; Comparison; Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC); Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC); Greenhouse effect",,,,,,"Wuebbles, D.J., Weighing functions for ozone depletion and greenhouse gas effects on climate (1995) Annu Rev Energy Env, 20, pp. 45-70; Calm, J.M., Hourahan, G.C., Refrigerant data summary (2001) Eng Syst, 18 (11), pp. 74-88; Daniel, J.S., Solomon, S., Albritton, D.L., On the evaluation of halocarbon radiative forcing and global warming potentials (1995) J Geophys Res, 100 (D1), pp. 1271-1285; Calm, J.M., Emissions and environmental impacts from air-conditioning and refrigeration systems (2002) Int J Refrigeration, 25 (3), pp. 293-305; Calm, J.M., Wuebbles, D.J., Jain, A.K., Impacts on global ozone and climate from use and emission of 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HCFC-123) (1999) J Climatic Change, 42 (2), pp. 439-474; Domanski, P.A., Didion, D.A., Doyle, J.P., Evaluation of suction line-liquid line heat exchange in the refrigeration cycle (1994) Int J Refrigeration, 17 (7), pp. 487-493; Calm, J.M., Didion, D.A., (1997) Trade-Offs in Refrigerant Selections-Past, Present, and Future.
