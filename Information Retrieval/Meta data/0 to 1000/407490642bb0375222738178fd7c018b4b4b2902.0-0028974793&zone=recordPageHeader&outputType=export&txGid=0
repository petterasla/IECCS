Results showed that cumulative respired C and mineralized N and S increased with temperature at all sites and were strongly related to an interaction between temperature and soil organic C. Production of respired C and mineralized N was closely fit by first-order kinetic models, whereas mineralized S was best described by zero-order kinetics.",,"Carbon; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Extraction; Mathematical models; Nitrogen; Soils; Sulfur; Thermal effects; Microbial respiration; Mineralization; Organic carbon; Temperature dependence; Climate change; carbon dioxide; microbial respiration; model; nitrogen mineralization; soil respiration; sulphur mineralization; North America, Great Lakes",,,,,,,"MacDonald, N.W.; Grand Valley State Univ, Allendale, United States",,,"Soil Science Soc of America, Madison, WI, United States",,,,,03615995,,SSSJD,,"English","SOIL SCI.
