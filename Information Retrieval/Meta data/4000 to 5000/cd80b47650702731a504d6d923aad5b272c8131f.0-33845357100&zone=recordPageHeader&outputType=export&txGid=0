The dusty cloud is defined as the cloud in dust storm environment or dust contaminated clouds. For clouds growing in the presence of dust, the instantaneous short-wave SW forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) is about -275.7 W m2 for cloud over dust (COD) region. The clouds developing in no-dust cloud (CLD) regions yield the most negative short-wave (SW) forcing (-311.0 W m2), which is about 12.8% stronger than those in COD regions. For long-wave (LW) radiative forcing the no-dust cloud (CLD) is around 102.8 W/m2, which is 20% less than the LW forcing from COD regions. The instantaneous TOA net radiative forcing for the CLD region is about -208.2 W m2, which is 42.1 % larger than the values of COD regions. The existence of dust aerosols under clouds significantly reduces the cooling effect of clouds.","Cloud radiative forcing; Dust aerosol-cloud-climate interaction; Dust storm; Global wanning",,,,,,"40575036, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., IPCC 2001: Climate change 2001, the scientific basis (2001), p. 892. , In: Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
