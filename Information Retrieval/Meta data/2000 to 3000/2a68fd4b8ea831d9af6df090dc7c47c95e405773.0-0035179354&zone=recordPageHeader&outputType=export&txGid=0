This generates significant environmental pollutants from the waste produced, including global warming gases, odor, and pathogens. The objectives of this study were to control the fermentation activity and pathogens in cattle and swine wastes with antimicrobial plant essential oils. Anaerobic one litre flasks with a working volume of 0.51 were used to evaluate the effect of carvacrol and thymol on production of fermentation gas, short-chain volatile fatty acids, lactate, and bacterial populations. In cattle waste, 1 g I-1 each of carvacrol and thymol completely inhibited the production of volatile fatty acids and lactate over 23 days. In swine waste, 2.5 g I-1 carvacrol inhibited the production of all volatile fatty acids. We conclude that these essential oils are effective in controlling livestock waste odor emissions and field studies are warranted.","Cattle; Essential oils; Manure; Odor; Swine; Volatile fatty acids","Agricultural wastes; Bacteria; Essential oils; Fatty acids; Fermentation; Global warming; Odor emissions; Odors; antiinfective agent; carvacrol; essential oil; lactic acid; pinene; short chain fatty acid; thymol; volatile fatty acid; emission control; livestock farming; odor; agricultural waste; air pollutant; anaerobic bacterium; animal experiment; cattle; conference paper; controlled study; fermentation; gas; global climate; manure; nonhuman; odor; plant; pollution control; swine; United States; warming; Air Pollution; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Anti-Infective Agents; Fatty Acids; Fermentation; Manure; Monoterpenes; Odors; Refuse Disposal; Swine; Terpenes; Thymol; Volatilization; United States",,"Anti-Infective Agents; carvacrol, 499-75-2; Fatty Acids; Manure; Monoterpenes; Terpenes; Thymol, 89-83-8",,,,"Beuchat, L.R., Antimicrobial properties of spices and their essential oils (1994) Natural Antimicrobial Systems and Food Preservation, pp. 167-179. , V.M.
