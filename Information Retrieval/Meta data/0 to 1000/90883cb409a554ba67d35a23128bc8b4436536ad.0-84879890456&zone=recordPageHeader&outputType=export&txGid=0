Three major features of the simulated Early Jurassic climate include the following. 1) A global warming, compared to the present, of 5°C to 10°C, with temperature increases at high latitudes five times this global average. Average summer temperature increases at high latitudes five times this global average. Average summer temperatures exceed 35°C in low-latitude regions of western Pangaea where eolian sandstones testify to the presence of vast deserts. 2) Simulated precipitation and evaporation patterns agree closely with the moisture distribution interpreted from evaporites, and coal deposits. High rainfall rates are associated primarily with monsoons that originate over the warm Tethys Ocean. These systems are found to be associated with localized pressure cells whose positions are controlled by topography and coastal geography. 3) Decreases in planetary albedo, occurring because of reductions in sea ice, snow cover, and low clouds, and increases in atmospheric water vapor are the positive climate feedbacks that amplify the global warming. Large seasonal temperature fluctuations occurred over mid- and high-latitude continental interiors. -from Authors",,"general circulation model; Jurassic; palaeoclimate; Pangaea; sedimentary record",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00167606,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879890456
