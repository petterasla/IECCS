The results show that there is more N2O in the northern hemisphere by about 0.7 ± 0.04 ppbv, and the Arctic to Antarctic difference is about 1.2 ± 0.1 ppbv. Concentrations at locations influenced by continental air are higher than at marine sites, showing the existence of large land-based emissions. For the period studied, N2O increased at an average rate of about 0.6 ppbv/year (∼0.2%/year) although there were periods when the rates were substantially different. Using ice core data, a record of N2O can be put together that goes back about 1000 years. It shows pre-industrial levels of about 287 ± 1 ppbv and that concentrations have now risen by about 27 ppbv or 9.4% over the last century. The ice core data show that N2O started increasing only during the 20th century. The data presented here represent a comprehensive view of the present global distribution of N2O and its historical and recent trends. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Global distribution; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Ice core data; N2O; Nitrous oxide; Trends","Air; Data reduction; Ice; Ice core data; Nitrogen oxides; nitrous oxide; ice; nitrous oxide; global change; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; trend analysis; Antarctica; Arctic; article; atmospheric diffusion; data analysis; global climate; greenhouse effect; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; history; retrospective study; Air Pollutants, Environmental; Antarctic Regions; Arctic Regions; Environmental Monitoring; History of Medicine, 15th Cent.; History of Medicine, 16th Cent.; History of Medicine, 17th Cent.; History of Medicine, 18th Cent.; History of Medicine, 19th Cent.; History of Medicine, 20th Cent.; History of Medicine, Medieval; Ice; Nitrous Oxide; Retrospective Studies; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Air Pollutants; Antarctic Regions; Arctic Regions; Environmental Monitoring; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, Medieval; Ice; Retrospective Studies; Goes",,"Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Air Pollutants",,,,"Battle, M., Bender, M., Sowers, T., Tans, P.P., Butler, J.H., Elkins, J.W., Ellis, J.T., Clarke, A.D., Atmospheric gas concentrations over the past century measured in air from firn at the South Pole (1996) Nature, 383, pp. 231-235; Bouwman, A.F., Van der Hoek, K.W., Olivier, J.G.J., Uncertainties in the global source distribution of nitrous oxide (1995) J.
