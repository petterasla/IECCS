Attention has focused on the growing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Critics in scientific and policy professions hold that simulation models are not yet adequate to guide policy decisions. Many western governments dissent from this judgment and insist that a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions should be achieved within 15 years and that remedial policies must be adopted to prevent catastrophic climate change. The proposed remedies range from saving tropical rain forests to forced conservation of energy or taxation of fossil-fuel combustion. A consensus is emerging in the scientific community to endorse a 'no regrets' policy that involves buying various kinds of 'insurance' against future global warming. © 1991.",,"carbon dioxide concentration; climate change; climatic change; conflict; emission control; fossil fuel; fossil fuel combustion; global warming; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; policy choice; scientific research; UNEP; warming",,,,,,"Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, Report of the United Nations Environment Programme, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York; (1990) The Economist, p. 85; Schneider, The global warming debate heats up: analysis and perspective (1990) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 71 (9), pp. 1292-1304; Schneider, The greenhouse effect: science and policy (1989) Science, 243 (4892), pp. 771-781. , See; White, The great climate debate (1990) Scientific American, 263 (1), pp. 36-43; Boden, Kanciruk, Fallell, (1990) Trends 90: A Compendium of Data on Global Change, , Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, ORNL/CDIAC-36; World Resources 1990–1991 (1990) Report of the World Resources Institute, p. 316. , Oxford University Press, New York and Oxford, Table 21.1; Houghton, Emissions of greenhouse gases (1989) Deforestation Rates in Tropical Forests and Their Climate Implication, pp. 53-62. , N.
