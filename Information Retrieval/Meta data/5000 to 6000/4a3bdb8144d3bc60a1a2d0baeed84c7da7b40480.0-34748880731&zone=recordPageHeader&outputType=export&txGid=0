This paper summarizes current thinking about planned adaptation. It starts with an explanation of key adaptation concepts, a description of the diversity of adaptation contexts, and a discussion of key prerequisites for effective adaptation. On the basis of this introduction, major approaches to climate impact and adaptation assessment and their evolution are reviewed. Finally, principles for adaptation assessment are derived from decision-analytical considerations and from the experience with past adaptation assessments. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2007.","Adaptation assessment; Climate change; Planned adaptation",,,,,,,"Climate proofing: A risk-based approach to adaptation, pacific studies series (2005), ADB Asian Development Bank, ManilaAdger, W.N., Agrawala, S., Mirza, M., Assessment of adaptation practices, options, constraints and capacity (2007) Climate Change 2007: Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, , In: IPCC (ed) chap 17.
