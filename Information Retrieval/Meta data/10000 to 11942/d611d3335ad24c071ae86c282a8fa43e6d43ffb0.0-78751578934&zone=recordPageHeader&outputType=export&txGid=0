Variability in the growth of chum salmon at ages 1 to 4 was estimated from scale analysis and the back-calculation method using scales of 4-year-old adults returning to the Ishikari River in Hokkaido, Japan, during 1943-2005. Growth of chum salmon at age 1 was less during the period from the 1940s to the mid-1970s compared to the period from the mid-1980s to the present. On the other hand, growth of chum salmon at ages 2, 3, and 4 has declined since the 1980s. Path analysis indicated that growth at age 1 in the Okhotsk Sea was directly affected by warmer sea surface temperatures associated with global warming. The increased growth at age 1 led directly to higher survival rates and indirectly to larger population sizes. Subsequently, in the Bering Sea, the larger population size was directly associated with decreased growth at age 3 and indirectly associated with shorter adult fork lengths despite the lack of relationships among sea surface temperature, zooplankton biomass, and growth at ages 2 to 4. Therefore, higher growth at age 1 related to global warming positively affected the survival rate of juvenile chum salmon in the Okhotsk Sea. The higher survival rates in turn appear to be causing a population density-dependent effect on growth at ages 2 to 4 and maturation in the Bering Sea due to limited carrying capacity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chum salmon; Density dependence; Global warming; Growth; Scale analysis; Survival","biomass; density dependence; drift (glacial deposit); global warming; growth response; long-term change; maturation; path analysis; population size; regression analysis; salmonid; sea surface temperature; survival; zooplankton; Bering Sea; Hokkaido; Ishikari River; Japan; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Okhotsk; Oncorhynchus keta",,,,,,"Aota, M., Long-term tendencies of sea ice concentration and air temperature in the Okhotsk Sea coast of Hokkaido (1999) PICES Sci Rep, 12, pp. 1-2; Bax, N.J., Early marine mortality of marked juvenile chum salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) released into Hood Canal (1983) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 40, pp. 426-435. , Puget Sound, Washington, in 1980; Beamish, R.J., Bouillon, D.R., Pacific salmon production trends in relation to climate (1993) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 50, pp. 1002-1016; Beamish, R.J., Mahnken, C., A critical size and period hypothesis to explain natural regulation of salmon abundance and the linkage to climate and climate change (2001) Prog Oceangr, 49, pp. 423-437; Beamish, R.J., Neville, C.E., Cass, A.J., Production of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in relation to decadal-scale changes in the climate and the ocean (1997) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 54, pp. 543-554; Beamish, R.J., Mahnken, C., Neville, C.M., Evidence that reduced early marine growth is associated with lower marine survival of coho salmon (2004) Trans Am Fish Soc, 133, pp. 26-33; Campana, S.W., How reliable are growth back-calculations based on otoliths?
