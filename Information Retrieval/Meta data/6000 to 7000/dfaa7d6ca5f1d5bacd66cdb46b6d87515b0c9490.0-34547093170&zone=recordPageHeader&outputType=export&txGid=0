Since ecological studies and climate change models require routine information on surface soil moisture, the ability to remotely sense this variable is highly desirable. Toward this end research was conducted on developing methods for the retrieval of spatially and temporally varying patterns of soil moisture from recently burned boreal forest ecosystems of Alaska using C-band satellite radar data. To do this we focused on both individual date and temporal SAR datasets to develop techniques and algorithms which indicate how moisture varies across a recently burned boreal forest. For each of the methods developed we focused on reducing errors of SAR-derived soil moisture estimates due to confounding factors of variations in vegetative biomass and surface roughness. For the individual date soil moisture monitoring, we grouped test sites by a measurable biophysical variable, burn severity, and then developed algorithms relating moisture to SAR backscatter for each burn severity group. The algorithms developed had high coefficients of determination (0.56-0.82) and the moisture maps produced had high accuracy (3.61 rms error) based on the minimal validation conducted. For the seasonal soil moisture mapping we used principal component analysis to capture the time-variant feature of soil moisture and minimize the relatively time-invariant features that confound SAR backscatter. This resulted in good agreement between the drainage maps produced and our limited in situ observations and weather data. However, further validation, with larger sample sizes, is needed. While this study focuses on Alaska, research indicates that the techniques developed should be applicable to boreal forests worldwide.",,"Burned boreal forest ecosystems; Remote monitoring; Satellite radar; Surface soil moisture; Wildfire; Algorithms; Forestry; Mapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar; Ecosystems; algorithm; backscatter; boreal forest; data set; error analysis; ERS-1; estimation method; forest ecosystem; model validation; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar; Algorithms; Ecosystems; Forest Fires; Forests; Mapping; Moisture; Radar; Satellites; Soil; Alaska; North America; United States",,,,,,"Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Alexander, M.E., Stocks, B.J., Kasischke, E.S., Distribution of forest ecosystems and the role of fire in the North American boreal region (2000) Ecological Studies 138: Fire, Climate Change, and Carbon Cycling in the Boreal Forest, pp. 111-131. , Springer-Verlag, New York; Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Brunzell, S., Kletzli, D., (2000) Investigation of C-band Microwave Scattering from Organic Soils, Final Report on Internal Research And Development Project to Veridian Systems Division, , General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Ann Arbor, MI; Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Harrell, P.A., Kasischke, E.S., French, N.H.F., The detection and mapping of Alaskan wildfires using a spaceborne imaging radar system (1997) International Jour-nal of Remote Sensing, 18, pp. 355-373; Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Kasischke, E.S., Brunzell, S.M., Tukman, M., Mudd, J.P., Mapping fire scars in global boreal forests using imaging radar data (2001) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 22, pp. 3665-3687; Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Nolan, M., Hyer, E., (2001) Analysis of SAR Data for Fire Danger Prediction in Boreal Alaska, pp. 98-129; Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Riordan, K., Garwood, G., Slawski, J., Alden, S., Cella, B., Assessing fuel moisture with satellite imaging radar for improved fire danger prediction in boreal Alaska (2005), pp. G13ABourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Riordan, K., Slawski, J., Medvecz, M., Ames, S., Walters, T., (2005)Dobson, M.C., Pierce, L., Sarabandi, K., Ulaby, F.T., Sharik, T., Preliminary analysis of ERS-1 SAR for forest ecosystem studies (1992) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 30, pp. 203-211; Dobson, M.C., Ulaby, F., Mapping soil moisture distribution with imaging radar, in principles and applications of imaging radar (1998) Manual of Remote Sensing, 2, pp. 407-433. , 3rd edition John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York; Dubois, P.C., Van Zyl, J., Engman, E.T., Measuring soil moisture with imaging radar (1995) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 3, pp. 915-926; Durant, M.L., Chambers, S.D., Chapin III, F.S., Effects of burn severity on surface CO2 exchange in Alaskan black spruce forests (Poster presented at the 1999 AGU Fall Meeting) (1999), pp. f75Dyrness, C.T., Norum, R.A., The effects of experimental fires on black spruce forest floors in interior Alaska (1983) Canadian Journal of Forestry Research, 13, pp. 879-893; Ferguson, S.A., Ruthford, J., Rirog, M., Sandberg, D.V., Measuring moss moisture dynamics to predict fire severity (2003), pp. 211-217French, N.H.F., Kasischke, E.S., Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Harrell, P.A., Sensitivity of ERS-1 SAR to variations in soil water in fire-disturbed boreal forest ecosystems (1996) Interna-tional Journal of Remote Sensing, 17, pp. 3037-3053; Garwood, G., Riordan, K., Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Slawski, J., Calibration algorithm development for selected water content reflectometers to organic soils of Alaska JGR (2006) Water Resources Research; Harrell, P.A., Bourgeau-Chavez, L.L., Kasischke, E.S., French, N.H.F., Christensen Jr., N.L., Sensitivity of ERS-1 and JERS-1 radar data to biomass and stand structure in Alaskan boreal forest (1995) Remote Sensing of Environment, 54, pp. 247-260; Jandt, R., Allen, J., Horschel, E., (2005) Forest Floor Moisture Content and Fire Danger Indices in Alaska, p. 30; Jensen, J.R., Principal component analysis (1996) Introductory Digital Image Processing; A Remote Sensing Perspective, pp. 172-179. , In K.C.
