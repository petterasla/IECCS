The paleoanalogue of global warming by 0.7-1°C is the Holocene climatic optimum (5.5-6 ka B.P.) and that by 1.7-2°C is the last interglacial optimum (about 125 ka B.P.). The complex analysis concerning response of the principal ecosystem components to the expected warming signifies that there will not be any shifts of vegetation zones during the 21st century; reconstruction will touch only the internal structure of vegetable associations and broadening of interzonal ecotones. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Global warming; Holocene; Last interglacial; Response of ecosystems","Complex analysis; Ecosystem components; Holocenes; Internal structure; Last interglacial; Response of ecosystems; Vegetation zone; Ecosystems; Principal component analysis; Global warming; climate variation; ecosystem response; ecotone; global warming; Holocene; Last Interglacial; paleoclimate; reconstruction; twenty first century",,,,,,"Budyko, M.I., Izrael, Yu.A., (1987) Anthropogenic Climate Changes, , (Gidrometeoizdat, Leningrad), [in Russian]; Pachauri, R.K., Reisinger, A., (2007) IPCC 2007: Climate Change 2007.
