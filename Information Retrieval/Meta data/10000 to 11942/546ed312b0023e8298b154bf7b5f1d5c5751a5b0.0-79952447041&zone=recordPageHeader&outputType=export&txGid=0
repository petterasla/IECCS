This poor soil fertility is one of the limiting factors of crop production in the SZ. Therefore, it is imperative to improve or to maintain soil fertility through various agricultural management methods. Further, it is well known that soil organic matter plays an important role in improving the physico-chemical properties of these sandy infertile soils. Therefore, it is essential to develop a suitable tool for the appropriate evaluation of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in the SZ. Therefore, the Rothamsted carbon model (Roth-C) was verified in 32 treatments of two long-term field experiments with and without crop residue application. These experiments were performed by ICRISAT. The performance of the model was evaluated by statistical methods using four indices (RMSE: root mean square error, LOFIT: lack of fit, r: correlation coefficient, and M: mean difference). As a result, the predicted SOC values in the case without crop residue management decreased with time in approximately 10 cultivated years. In contrast, in the case with crop residue application, the predicted SOC remained roughly equal to the initial SOC value during the term observed. Mostly, the Roth-C-modelled values agreed well with the actual value. RMSE and LOFIT, the statistical indicators of agreement between predicted and observed values, showed a significant conformity between the predicted and observed SOC values in all the 32 treatments. This fact means that Roth-C can estimate long-term SOC dynamics of several technical options that developed with short-term trials. Moreover the annual carbon requirement for SOC maintaining can be calculate if enough number of cases was estimated. And also analysis of regional carbon dynamics was made possible with using Roth-C model. It will contribute to show the sustainable development in SZ against global warming and other climatic changes. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Long-term experiment; Niger; Rothamsted carbon model; Soil organic carbon","agricultural management; crop production; global warming; limiting factor; model validation; organic carbon; physicochemical property; sandy soil; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil organic matter; sustainable development; Niger [West Africa]",,,,,,"Ayanaba, A., Jenkinson, D.S., Decomposition of carbon-14 labeled ryegrass and maize under tropical conditions (1990) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 54, pp. 112-115; Bationo, A., Fertilizer research program in Niger (1987) IFDC/ICRISAT Annu, , Rep.
