Blocks of peat from an ombrotrophic mire at Abisko, northern Sweden, were transplanted to nine warmer sites in Sweden in June 1996. The changes in nematode abundance and species composition were followed by monthly samplings from July to December 1996 with a final sampling in June 1997. In all sites except the most northern the total nematode numbers increased during the study period. However, especially at the three northern-most sites the composition of the nematode fauna changed very little. Most species from the mire survived in all transplants and the number of immigrating species was low. The most clearcut effects on faunal composition were seen in blocks transferred to open sites in central and southern Sweden. This was also indicated by the Maturity index (sensu Bongers) and Renkonen numbers (comparing similarity in fauna structure between source site and transplantation sites). These parameters had the lowest values in blocks placed in the exposed sites where the greatest fluctations in temperature and moisture occurred. One conclusion of the study is that a climatic change has no rapid influence on the composition of the nematode fauna; soil structure and vegetation have a stronger influence. If the soil structure and vegetation start to change this will certainly also influence the nematode fauna. Upon warming above certain temperature thresholds, expected changes would result in an increased rate of mineralization followed by higher abundance of fungal and bacterial feeders belonging to the Secernentea.","Biodiversity; Competitive ability; Fauna structure; Population dynamics; Soil nematodes; Temperature threshold","climate change; community structure; global warming; nematode; species diversity; tundra; Sweden; Nematoda",,,,,,"Anderson, R.V., Coleman, D.C., Nematode temperature responses: A niche dimension in populations of bacterial-feeding nematodes (1982) Journal of Nematology, 14, pp. 69-76; Boag, B., Crawford, J.W., Neilson, R., The effect of potential climatic changes on the geographical distribution of the plant-parasitic nematodes Xiphinema and Longidorus in Europe (1991) Nematologica, 37, pp. 312-323; Bongers, T., The maturity index: An ecological measure of environmental disturbance based on nematode species composition (1990) Oecologia, 83, pp. 14-19; Bongers, T., Bongers, M., Functional diversity of nematodes (1998) Applied Soil Ecology, 10, pp. 239-251; Bouwman, L.A., Zwart, K.B., The ecology of bacterivorous protozoans and nematodes in arable soil (1994) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 51, pp. 145-160; Dao, F.D., Climatic influence on the distribution pattern of plant parasitic and soil inhabiting nematodes (1970) Mededelingen Landbouwhogeschool Wageningen, 70 (2), pp. 1-181; Ekschmitt, K., Bakonyi, G., Bongers, M., Bongers, T., Boström, S., Dogan, H., Harrison, A., Wolters, V., Effects of the nematofauna on microbial energy and matter transformation rates in European grassland soils Plant and Soil, , in press; Ettema, C.H., Soil nematode diversity: Species coexistence and ecosystem function (1998) Journal of Nematology, 30, pp. 159-169; Ettema, C.H., Coleman, D.C., Vellidis, G., Lowrance, R., Rathbun, S.L., Spatiotemporal distributions of bacterivorous nematodes and soil resources in a restored riparian wetland (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 2721-2734; Freckman, D.W., Ettema, C.H., Assessing nematode communities in agroecosystems of varying human intervention (1993) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 45, pp. 239-261; Freckman, D.W., Virginia, R.A., Low-diversity antarctic soil nematode communities: Distribution and response to disturbance (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 363-369; Griffiths, B.S., Ritz, K., Wheatley, R.E., Nematodes as indicators of enhanced microbiological activity in a Scottish organic farming system (1994) Soil Use and Management, 10, pp. 20-24; Harte, J., Rawa, A., Price, V., Effects of manipulated soil microclimate on mesofaunal biomass and diversity (1996) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 28, pp. 313-322; Henry, G.H.R., Molau, U., Tundra plants and climate change: The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) (1997) Global Change Biology, 3 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 1-9; Hodkinson, I.D., Wookey, P.A., Functional ecology of soil organisms in tundra ecosystems: Towards the future (1999) Applied Soil Ecology, 11, pp. 111-126; Kuzmin, L.L., Free-living nematodes in the tundra of western Taimyr (1976) Oikos, 27, pp. 501-505; Lagerlöf, J., Magnusson, C., Rosswall, T., Investigation of nematodes at the Stordalen site (1975) International Biological Programme, Swedish Tundra Biome Project, Technical Report, 18, pp. 1-32; Neher, D.A., Peck, S.L., Rawlings, J.O., Campbell, C.L., Measures of nematode community structure and sources of variability among and within agricultural fields (1995) The Significance and Regulation of Soil Biodiversity, pp. 187-201. , Collins, H.P., Robertson, G.P. & Klug, M.J.
