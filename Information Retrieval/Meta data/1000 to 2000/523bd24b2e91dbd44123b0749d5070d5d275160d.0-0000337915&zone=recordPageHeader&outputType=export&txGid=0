The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has been ratified by 118 nations and came into force in 1994, has amongst its aims the protection of ecosystems. This paper reviews the relevant text in the Convention and gives an overview of scientific efforts to provide policymakers with the necessary information on ecosystem impacts. The sensitivity of different types of ecosystem to climatic change is discussed and the concepts of ecological limits and thresholds are addressed and examples given. The paper concludes there is a need for a better understanding of the impacts of climate change on ecosystem resilience in order to maintain biological diversity and respond to the needs of policymakers in implementing the UNFCCC. Recommendations are made for increased research effort, including increased resolution of climate models, better predictive capacity at a regional level for within- and between-year rainfall patterns, seasonality and extreme events. Collaborative monitoring programs, including long-term ecological research along climate gradients, are proposed for 4 biomes: coastal wetlands, montane ecosystems, coral reefs and Arctic ecosystems.","Adaptation; Biodiversity; Climate; Conservation; Critical levels; Ecosystem impacts; Global warming; Protected areas; UNFCCC",,,,,,,"Agardy, M.T., Advances in marine conservation: The role of marine protected areas (1994) Trends Ecol Evol, 9 (7), pp. 267-270; Arrow, K., Bolin, B., Costanza, R., Dasgupta, P., Folke, C., Holling, C.S., Jansson, B.O., Pimental, D., Economic growth, carrying capacity, and the environment (1995) Science, 268, pp. 520-521; Bawa, K.S., Markham, A., Climate change and tropical forests (1995) TREE, 10 (9), pp. 348-349; Bernabo, C.J., Eglinton, P.D., (1992) Joint Climate Project to Address Decisionmakers' Uncertainties: Report of Findings, , Science and Policy Associates, Inc, Washington, DC; Blaustein, A.R., Wake, D.B., Sousa, W.P., Amphibian declines: Judging stability, persistence, and susceptibility of populations to local and global extinctions (1994) Conserv Biol, 8 (1), pp. 60-71; Botkin, D.B., Woodby, A.D., Nisbet, A.R., Kirtland's warbler habitats: A possible early indicator of climatic warming (1991) Biol Conserv, 56, pp. 63-78; Briffa, K.R., Jones, P.D., Schweingruber, F.H., Shiyatov, S.G., Cook, E.R., Unusual twentieth-century summer warmth in a 1,000-year temperature record from Siberia (1995) Nature, 376, pp. 156-159; Buddemeier, R.W., Climate change and biology: A proposal for scientific impact assessment and response (1990) The Unity of Evolutionary Biology, , Dudley EC (ed) Dioscorides Press, Portland, OR; Cairns Jr., J., McCormick, P.V., Developing an ecosystem-based capability for ecological risk assessments (1992) Environ Prof, 14, pp. 186-196; Carter, T.R., Parry, M.L., Harasawa, H., Nishioka, S., (1994) IPCC Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations, , University College, London; Chapin III, F.S., Jefferies, R.L., Reynolds, J.F., Shaver, G.R., Svoboda, J., (1992) Arctic Ecosystems in a Changing Climate: An Ecophysiological Perspective, , Academic Press, San Diego; Cheung, P.S.C., Climate change in Xishuangbanna, S.
