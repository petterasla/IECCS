In addition, amorphous metal-based magnetic components are used in power electronics, telecommunication equipment, sensing devices, electronic article surveillance systems, etc. Some magnetic inductors find applications in pulse power devices, automotive ignition coils, and electric power conditioning systems. All of these applications are possible because of faster flux reversal, lower magnetic loss and more versatile property modification achievable in amorphous alloys. Improvements in materials processing and device fabrication technology will continue to take place, which will further increase the universe of application of amorphous soft magnets. Some fundamental problems associated with the applications are mentioned.",,"Amorphous alloys; Electric transformers; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Magnetic flux; Magnetic leakage; Power electronics; Amorphous soft magnetic materials; Faster flux reversal; Magnetic inductors; Soft magnetic materials",,,,,,"Duwez, P., Lin, S.C.H., (1967) J.
