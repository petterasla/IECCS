The 3-year average annual thermal regime was calculated for streams where presence or absence was known for these 15 species. Six variables estimated to be of biological importance to the winter and summer survival and recruitment of a species, including measures of feeding and nonfeeding periods, were calculated from these thermal regimes. Stepwise discriminant analysis and multiple regression were used to select optimal variables for creating multivariate models. Parametric and nonparametric multivariate discriminant analyses were then performed to test our ability to correctly classify presence or absence using the thermal variables. These statistical empirical models were able to correctly predict presence or absence with greater than 90% accuracy for 13 of 15 species. Nonparametric (Kth nearest neighbor) analyses had marginally more accurate predictions than parametric (linear) analyses. This technique may allow for an improved estimation of potential changes in distribution under various global warming scenarios.",,"fish; species occurrence; temperature effect; United States",,,,,,"Boschung, H.T., Williams, J.D., Gotshall, D.W., Caldwell, D.K., Caldwell, M.C., (1983) The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fishes, Whales, and Dolphins, , Knopf, New York; Eaton, J.G., Coauthors, S., A field information-based system for estimating fish temperature tolerances (1995) Fisheries, 20 (4), pp. 10-18; Eaton, J.G., Scheller, R.M., Effects of climate warming on fish thermal habitat in streams of the United States (1996) Limnology and Oceanography, 41, pp. 1109-1115; (1995) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Johnson, M.G., Charlton, W.H., Some effects of temperature on the metabolism and activity of the largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides Lacépède (1960) Progressive Fish-Culturist, 22, pp. 155-163; Johnson, T.B., Evans, D.O., Behavior, energetics, and associated mortality of young-of-the-year white perch (Morone americana) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) under simulated winter conditions (1991) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 48, pp. 672-680; Johnson, T.B., Evans, D.O., Temperature constraints on overwinter survival of age-0 white perch (1996) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 125, pp. 466-471; Keast, A., Feeding of some Great Lakes fishes at low temperatures (1968) Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada, 25, pp. 1199-1218; Keast, A., Mechanisms expanding niche width and minimizing intraspecific competition between two centrarchid fishes (1977) Evolutionary Biology, 10, pp. 333-395; Kleinbaum, D.G., Kupper, L.L., Muller, K.E., (1988) Applied Regression Analysis and Other Multivariable Methods, , PWS-Kent, Boston; Lachenbruch, P.A., Mickey, M.A., Estimation of error rates in discriminant analysis (1968) Technometrics, 10, pp. 1-10; Lyons, J., Influence of winter starvation on the distribution of smallmouth bass amoung Wisconsin streams: A bioenergetics modeling assessment (1997) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 126, pp. 157-162; Magnuson, J.J., Coauthors, E., Potential effects of climate changes on aquatic systems: Laurentian Great Lakes and Precambrian Shield region (1997) Hydrological Processes, 11, pp. 825-871; Maxwell, J.R., Coauthors, F., (1995) A Hierarchical Framework of Aquatic Ecological Units in North America (Nearctic Zone), , U.S. Forest Service General Technical Report NC-176; McComish, T.S., (1971) Laboratory Experiments on Growth and Food Conversion of the Bluegill, , Doctoral dissertation.
