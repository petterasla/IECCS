To examine the effects of this change on rice productivity, we exposed rice plants to a higher (by +2.7 to +2.8°C) water temperature (Tw) during the vegetative growth period (for 35-50 days) under three levels of N fertilization. High Tw during vegetative growth made the heading stage occur 4-7 days earlier for all levels of N fertilization in both years. The crop growth rate during the treatment period was greatly enhanced by high Tw: by 51-82% in 2008 and by 49-62% in 2009. There was no Tw×N fertilizer interaction. This increased growth was associated with increased leaf expansion and increased canopy radiation capture rather than with increased radiation-use efficiency. However, the positive effect decreased during subsequent growth stages under all levels of N fertilization, leading to no significant differences in total biomass at maturity. High Tw during vegetative growth greatly reduced SPAD values during the grain-filling stage compared with SPAD values in the control Tw treatment, for all levels of N fertilization, and decreased leaf photosynthesis during the mid-grain filling stage. Grain yield was not significantly affected by high Tw at any N fertilizer level or in either year. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Grain yield; Rice; Water temperature","biomass; crop yield; fertilizer application; global warming; growth rate; high temperature; light use efficiency; nitrogen; rice; vegetative propagation; water temperature",,,,,,"Arai-Sanoh, Y., Ishimaru, T., Ohsumi, A., Kondo, M., Effects of soil temperature on growth and root function in rice (2010) Plant Prod.
