Their average atmospheric concentrations in the northern/southern hemisphere have been monitored since 1979 in order to study their behaviors and the future trends of their concentrations in the atmosphere: 1. An extremely clean analytical system has been developed for accurate analysis of atmospheric chlorofluorocarbons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and other halocarbons. Atmospheric samples were collected at the surface level by grab-sampling and analyzed by ECD gas chromatography. 2. The background atmospheric concentrations of CC13F (CFC-11) and CC12F2 (CFC-12) in the mid-latitude northern hemisphere have been increasing by 4% a year over the past decade. The concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 observed in Antarctica have been 8-10% lower than those observed in the northern hemisphere in accordance with the predominant emission of chlorofluorocarbons in the northern hemisphere and the delay (~2 years) in their diffusion into the southern hemisphere across the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The CC12FCC1F2 (CFC-113) concentration in the atmosphere tends to increase much faster than those of CFC-11 and CFC-12. 3. The vertical profiles of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere have also been measured by means of balloon grab-sampling and cryogenic sampling. They reflect how efficiently these compounds undergo UV-photolysis to release chlorine atoms and end up with depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. © 1992 IUPAC",,,,,,,,"Molina, M.J., Rowland, F.S., (1974) Nature, 249, pp. 810-812; (1988), Executive Summary of Ozone Trends Panel (Makide, Y., Tominaga, T., Rowland, F.S., (1979) Chem.
