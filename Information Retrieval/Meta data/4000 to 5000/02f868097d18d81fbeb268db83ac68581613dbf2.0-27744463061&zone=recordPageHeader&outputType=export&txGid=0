In the 1961-1990 climate, for much of the middle to high latitudes the standard deviation of precipitation for both months is roughly proportional to the mean, with the coefficient of variation (C) typically 0.3-0.5. The variability there is shown to be largely consistent with that from a first-order Markov chain model of the daily rainfall occurrence, with the distribution of wet-day amounts approximated by a gamma distribution. Global distributions of Mark 2-based parameters of this stochastic model, commonly used in weather generators, are presented. In low latitudes, however, the variability from the coupled model is typically double that anticipated by the stochastic model, as quantified by an 'overdispersion ratio'. C often exceeds one at subtropical locations, where rain is less frequent, but sometimes relatively heavy. The stantdard deviation of monthly mean precipitation S generally increases as the global model warms, with the global mean S in 2071-2100 in January (July) being 9.0% (11.5%) larger than in 1961-1990. Decreases in some subtropical locations occur, particularly where mean precipitation decreases. The global pattern of overdispersion is largely unchanged, however, and the changes in S can be related to those in the stochastic model parameters. Much of the increase in S is associated with increases in the scale parameter of the gamma distribution of wet-day amounts. Changes in C, which is unaffected by this parameter, are generally small. Increases in C in several subtropical bands and over northern midlatitude land in July are related to a decreased frequency of precipitation, and (to a lesser degree) changes in the gamma shape parameter. Some potential applications of the results to downscaling are discussed, and illustrated using observed rainfall from southeast Australia. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
