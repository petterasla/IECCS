It is essential, therefore, to understand basic physical mechanisms leading to overheating. It is well known that application of an electric field to conductors heats electric charge carriers. Often an elevated electron temperature describes the result of the heating. This paper demonstrates that an electric field applied to a conductor with discrete electron spectrum produces a nonequilibrium electron distribution, which cannot be described by temperature. Such electron distribution changes dramatically the conductivity of highly mobile two-dimensional electrons in a magnetic field, forcing them into a state with a zero differential resistance. Most importantly the results demonstrate that, in general, the effective overheating in the systems with discrete spectrum is significantly stronger than the one in systems with continuous and homogeneous distribution of the energy levels at the same input power. © 2008 The American Physical Society.",,,,,,,,"Levinson, I.B., (1965) Sov.
