The total CH4 emission by Chinese economy 2007 estimated as 39,592.70Gg is equivalent to three quarters of China's CO2 emission from fuel combustion by the global thermodynamic potentials, and even by the commonly referred lower IPCC global warming potentials is equivalent to one sixth of China's CO2 emission from fuel combustion and greater than the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion of many economically developed countries such as UK, Canada, and Germany. Agricultural activities and coal mining are the dominant direct emission sources, and the sector of Construction holds the top embodied emissions in both production and consumption. The emission embodied in gross capital formation is more than those in other components of final demand characterized by extensive investment and limited consumption. China is a net exporter of embodied CH4 emissions with the emission embodied in exports of 14,021.80Gg, in magnitude up to 35.42% of the total direct emission. China's exports of textile products, industrial raw materials, and primary machinery and equipment products have a significant impact on its net embodied emissions of international trade balance. Corresponding policy measures such as agricultural carbon-reduction strategies, coalbed methane recovery, export-oriented and low value added industry adjustment, and low carbon energy polices to methane emission mitigation are addressed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Input-output embodiment analysis; Inventory; Methane emission","Agricultural activities; Chinese economy; Coal mining; Coalbed methane recovery; Developed countries; Direct emissions; Environmental resources; Fuel combustion; Germany; Global warming potential; Input-output; Input-Output table; Low carbon; Mainland Chinese; Methane emissions; Policy measures; Reduction strategy; Significant impacts; Textile products; Thermodynamic potentials; Value-added industry; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Economics; Fuels; Global warming; International trade; Investments; Machinery; Metal recovery; Methane; Industrial emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combustion; emission inventory; energy policy; global warming; input-output analysis; international trade; methane; Canada; China; Germany; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Bhattacharya, S.C., Abdul Salam, P., Sharma, M., Emissions from biomass energy use in some selected Asian countries (2000) Energy, 25, pp. 169-188; Bibler, C.J., Marshall, J.S., Pilcher, R.C., Status of worldwide coal mine methane emissions and use (1998) International Journal of Coal Geology, 35, pp. 283-310; Cai, Z.C., Advances on methane emission from paddy fields in China (1999) Soils, 5, pp. 266-269. , in Chinese; Cai, Z.F., (2009), Water resources and greenhouse gas emissions covered ecological exergy account.
