The protection mechanism of SF6 containing cover gases on molten magnesium alloys was presented. The cover gas protects the melt by reacting with the melt to form a coherent protective film on the melt surface. The film contains MgO and MgF2. Particles containing MgF2 form on the interface between the oxide film and the bulk magnesium alloy, which correspond to the concave areas from the surface observation. These particles increase the Pilling and Bedworth ratio of surface film and enhance the protective capability of the films. Based on the understanding of the mechanism of SF6, a melting technology in a sealed furnace was proposed, and the protection behavior of magnesium alloys in the sealed melting furnace was investigated under the protective atmosphere containing HFC-134a. The morphology and composition of the surface film were also studied. Experiments to evaluate the protective effect of two other fluorine containing gases with low GWPs on AZ91D alloy in the sealed furnace were also carried out, and the results show that the new gases are potential substitutes for SF6. © 2010 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.","Magnesium alloy; melt protection; protection mechanism; SF6; surface film","AZ91D alloy; Cover gas; Global warming potential; Magnesium industry; Melt surfaces; Melting technology; Molten magnesium; Morphology and composition; protection mechanism; Protection mechanisms; Protective effects; Protective films; Surface films; Surface observation; Alloys; Electric furnaces; Fluorine; Furnaces; Global warming; Magnesium; Magnesium alloys; Oxide films; Protective atmospheres; Sulfur; Cerium alloys",,,,,,"Tharumarajah, A., Koltun, P., Is there an environmental advantage of using magnesium components for light-weighting cars [J] (2007) Journal of Cleaner Production, 15, pp. 1007-1013; Mebarki, N., Ravi, K.N., Blandin, J.J., Suery, M., Pelloux, F., Khelifati, G., Correlation between ignition and oxidation behaviors of AZ91 magnesium alloy [J] (2005) Materials Science and Technology, 21 (10), pp. 1145-1151; Zeng Y.-wen, Mao M.-xian, Huang Z.-qiang, Research on magnesium melting protected by cover gas mixtures containing HFC-32 [J] (2006) Foundry, 55 (8), pp. 776-779. , (in Chinese); Fruehling, J.W., Hanawalt, J.D., Protective atmospheres for melting magnesium alloys [J] (1969) American Foundryman's Society Transactions, 77, pp. 159-164; Cashion, S.P., (1998) The Use of Sulphur hexafluoride(SF6) for Protecting Molten Magnesium [D], , Department of Mining, Minerals and Materials Engineering, University of Queensland Australia; Pettersen, G., Øvrelid, E., Tranell, G., Characterization of the surface films formed on molten magnesium in different protective atmospheres [J] (2002) Materials Science and Engineering A, 332, pp. 285-294; Aarstad, K., Various techniques to study the surface of magnesium protected by SF 6 [C] (2003) Magnesium Technology 2003, pp. 35-38. , TMS San Diego, USA; Baker, P.W., Frost, M.T., (2000) Cover Gases, , Australia, WO0064614[P]; Dean, S.M., Development of 3M™ Novec™ 612 magnesium protection fluid as a substitute for SF6 over molten magnesium [C] (2002) International Conference on SF6 and the Environment, , US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) San Diego, USA; Pilling, N.B., Bedworth, R.E., The oxidation of metals at high temperature[J] (1923) Journal of the Institute of Metals, (29), pp. 29-33; Zhou, H., Wang M.-xing, I, W.L., Wang, L., Zhao, Y., Effect of Ce addition on ignition point of AM50 alloy powders [J] (2006) Materials Letters, 60, pp. 3238-3240; Won, H., Young, J.K., Effects of cover gases on melt protection of Mg alloys [J] (2006) Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 422, pp. 208-213; Teng, S.S., Jyun, B.L., Pai, S.W., Oxide films on magnesium and magnesium alloys [J] (2007) Materials Chemistry and Physics, 104, pp. 497-504; Hillis, J.E., The international program to identify alternatives to SF6 for magnesium melt protection [C] (2002) International Conference on SF6 and the Environment, , US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) San Diego, USA; James, M.C., The next generation of refrigerants-historical review, considerations, and outlook [J] (2008) International Journal of Refrigeration, 31, pp. 1123-1133; Bartos, S., Curtis, L., Scharfenberg, J., Kantamaneni, R., Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from magnesium die casting [J] (2007) Journal of Cleaner Production, 15, pp. 979-987","Xiong, S.-M.; State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; email: smxiong@tsinghua.edu.cn",,,,,,,,10036326,,TNMCE,,"English","Trans Nonferrous Met Soc China",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955535242
