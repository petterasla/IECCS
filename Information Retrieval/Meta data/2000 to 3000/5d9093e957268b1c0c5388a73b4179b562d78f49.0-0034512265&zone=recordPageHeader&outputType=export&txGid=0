Change detection using satellite data alone requires rigorous error analysis for their derived ice products, including inter-satellite validation for long time series. All models of physical processes are only approximations, and the best models of complicated physical processes have errors and uncertainties. A promising approach is data assimilation, combining model, in situ data and satellite remote-sensing data. Sea-ice monitoring from satellite, ice-model estimates, and the potential benefit of combining the two are discussed in some detail. In a case-study we demonstrate how the sea-ice backscatter for the Beaufort Sea region was derived using a backscattering model in combination with an ice model. We conclude that, for data assimilation, the first steps include the use of simple models, moving, with success at this level, to progressively more complex models. We also recommend reconfiguring the current remote-sensing data to include precise time tags with each pixel. For example, the current Special Sensor Microwave Imager data might be reissued in a time-tagged orbital (or gridded) format as opposed to the currently available daily averaged gridded data. Finally, error statistics and quality-control information also need to be readily available in a form useful for assimilation. The effectiveness of data-assimilation techniques is directly linked to the availability of data error statistics.",,"data assimilation; ice thickness; monitoring; remote sensing; sea ice",,,,,,"Agnew, T.A., Le, H., Hirose, T., Estimation of large-scale sea-ice motion from SSM/I 85.5 GHz imagery (1997) Ann.
