The trend of average first-flowering times per year for the study group shows a significant advance of 2.4 days over a 30-year period. When 11 species that exhibit later first-flowering times are excluded from the data set, the remaining 89 show a significant advance of 4.5 days. Significant trends for earlier-flowering species range from -3.2 to -46 days, while those for later-flowering species range from +3.1 to +10.4 days. Advances of first-flowering in these 89 species are directly correlated with local increase in minimum temperature (Tmin).","First-flowering; Global warming; Minimum temperature; Spring-flowering; Washington DC","flowering; global warming; spring (season); United States",,,,,,"Alward, R.D., Detling, J.K., Milchunas, D.G., Grassland vegetation changes and nocturnal global warming (1999) Science, 283, pp. 229-231; Chapin, F.S., Shaver, G., Giblin, A., Nadelhoffer, K., Laundre, J., Responses of arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Easterling, D.R., Horton, B., Jones, P.D., Peterson, T.C., Karl, T.R., Parker, D.E., Salinger, M.J., Folland, C.K., Maximum and minimum temperature trends for the globe (1997) Science, 277, pp. 364-367; Houghton, J.T., Meria Filho, L.G., Callender, B., Harris, N., (1995) The Science of Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Kartesz, J.T., (1994) A Synonymized Checklist of the United States, Canada, and Adjacent Greenland, 2nd Edn., , (2 vols.)
