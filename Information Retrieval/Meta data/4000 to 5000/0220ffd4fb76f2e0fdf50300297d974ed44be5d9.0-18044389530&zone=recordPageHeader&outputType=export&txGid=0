One proposed solution involves sequestering in the deep sea a substantial portion of the excess CO2 produced. Because large areas would be affected and this environment harbors one of the world's largest reservoirs of biodiversity, the approach is controversial. In particular, deep-sea diversity is found largely in the animals that live in the sediment, but the effects of sequestered CO2 on these organisms are not known. We therefore introduced ̃60 1 of liquid CO2 onto the seafloor at 3250 m depth and sampled ̃2 and ̃40 m from the deposition site 30 d later. The pore water in the samples taken near the site was 0.75 pH unit more acidic (pH decreases when CO2 concentration increases) than that in samples taken farther away. Representative infauna had been killed in significantly greater numbers in the former than in the latter location. This demonstration that sequestered CO2 can adversely affect the deep-sea infauna brings CO2 sequestration in the deep sea into potential conflict with the preservation of deep-sea biodiversity. © Inter-Research 2005.","Benthic infauna; CO2 sequestration; Deep sea; Diversity; Global warming; Harpacticoid copepods","biodiversity; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; ecological impact; global warming; zoobenthos; Animalia; Copepoda",,,,,,"Carman, K.R., Thistle, D., Fleeger, J.W., Barry, J.P., The influence of introduced CO2 on deep-sea metazoan meiofauna (2004) J Oceanogr, 60, pp. 767-772; France, R.L., Collins, N.C., Extirpation of crayfish in a lake affected by long-range anthropogenic acidification (1993) Conserv Biol, 7, pp. 184-188; Glover, A.G., Smith, S.R., The deep-sea floor ecosystem: Current status and prospectus of anthropogenic change by the year 2025 (2003) Environ Conserv, 30, pp. 219-241; Grassle, J.F., Maciolek, N.J., Deep-sea species richness: Regional and local diversity estimates from quantitative bottom samples (1992) Am Nat, 139, pp. 313-341; Herzog, H., Eliasson, B., Kaarstad, O., Capturing greenhouse gases (2000) Sci Am, 282 (2), pp. 72-77; Hessler, R.R., Sanders, H.L., Faunal diversity in the deep sea (1967) Deep-Sea Res, 14, pp. 65-78; Hoffert, M.I., Caldeira, K., Benford, G., Criswell, D.R., Advanced technology paths to global climate stability: Energy for a greenhouse planet (2002) Science, 298, pp. 981-987; Lambshead, P.J.D., Recent developments in marine benthic biodiversity research (1993) Océanis, 19, pp. 5-24; Lambshead, P.J.D., Boucher, G., Marine nematode deep-sea biodiversity - Hyperdiverse or hype?
