In international relations, "" epistemic communities"" of scientists are thought to help provide information for these purposes. However, conflicting preferences can frustrate the transmission of information and prevent effective information sharing. In addition, opportunities for information sharing can deepen distrust as actors observe each other's reaction to what to them is credible information. A model that assumes uncertainty both about the state of the world and the parties' motivations is applied to international climate change negotiations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change negotiations; Epistemic communities; Game theory","Epistemic communities; Information sharing; International relations; Sharing information; Standard model; Climate models; Energy policy; Game theory; Global warming; Information retrieval; Information dissemination; climate change; cooperative behavior; energy policy; game theory; global warming; international relations; modeling; negotiation process; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,"Adler, E., The emergence of cooperation: national epistemic communities and the international evolution of the idea of nuclear arms control (1992) International Organization, 46 (1), pp. 101-145; Austen-Smith, D., Fedderson, T.J., Deliberation, preference uncertainty, and voting rules (2006) American Political Science Review, 100 (2), pp. 209-217; Farrell, J., Rabin, M., Cheap talk (1996) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 10 (3), pp. 103-118; Haas, P., Banning chloroflourocarbons: epistemic community efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone (1992) International Organization, 46 (1), pp. 187-224; Hardin, R., (2002) Trust and Trustworthiness, , Russell Sage Foundation, New York; Kagan, R., (2003) Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order, , Knopf, New York; Kydd, A.H., (2005) Trust and Mistrust in International Relations, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; (2001), http://www.pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=, Pew Global Attitudes Project,.
