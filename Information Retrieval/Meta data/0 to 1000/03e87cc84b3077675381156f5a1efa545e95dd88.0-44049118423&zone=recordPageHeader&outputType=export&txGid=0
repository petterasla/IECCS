This methane poses an explosion hazard in mines and when released into the atmosphere, acts as a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. Methanotrophic bacteria in gas phase bioreactors (GPBs) offer the potential to convert this methane to less deleterious substances; however, it is critical that reaction rates be maximized. The effect of kaolin on rates of methane oxidation by Methylomonas methanica grown in GPBs was assessed. The amendment of GPBs with a 4% kaolin solution significantly increased methane removal by M. methanica versus non-kaolin-amended controls. The maximum velocities (vmax) were 604.1 mg methane min-1 GPB-1 in the control compared to 1156.6 mg methane min-1 GPB-1 in the kaolin-amended bioreactors, while the Michaelis constants (Km) were 15.87 and 60.52 mg methane GPB-1, respectively. © 1992.","coal volatiles; methane; oxidation",,,,,,,"Coward, Jones, (1952) Limits of flammability of gases and vapors, Bull. 503.
