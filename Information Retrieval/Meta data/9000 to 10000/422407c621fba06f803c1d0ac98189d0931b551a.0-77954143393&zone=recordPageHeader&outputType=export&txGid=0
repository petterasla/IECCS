However, little information can be found about the impacts of a large range of soil temperature fluctuation (e.g. -10 to 5°C) over winter on the soil nitrogen (N) dynamics in the field. In the present study, we employed an intact soil core in situ incubation technique, and measured soil N mineralization and nitrification rates under three plant communities, i.e. a grassland, a shrub and a plantation, during the non-growing season (October 2004-April 2005) in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results demonstrate the significant effects of different plant communities on soil net N mineralization and the great temporal variations of soil N dynamics during the incubation period. The mean soil net N mineralization rates were 0.93, 0.77 and -1.28mg Nm-2d-1, respectively, in the grassland, shrub and plantation. The mean soil NH4 +-N in the three plant communities declined by 40%, but the mean soil NO3 --N increased by 190% by the end of the incubation compared with their initial concentrations at the beginning of incubation. The differences in plant communities significantly affected their soil N mineralization rates, accumulations and turnover rates, which followed the order: grassland&gt;shrub&gt;plantation. During the winter time, the studied soils experienced the three phases consisting of mild freezing (-7 to -2°C soil), deep freezing (approximately -10°C soil) and freeze-thaw (-2 to 5°C soil). The results suggest that temporal variations of soil N mineralization are positively affected by the soil temperature and the soil nitrification is dominant in the N transformation process during the non-growing season. Our study indicates that the soil N mineralization over winter can make a substantial contribution to the mineral N pool that plants are able to utilize in the upcoming spring, but may also pose a great risk of mineral N leaching loss if great rainfalls occur during spring and early summer. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Inner Mongolia; N mineralization; Non-growing season; Plant community",,,,,,,"Berendse, F., Interspecific competition and niche differentiation between Plantago lanceolata and Anthoxanthum odoratum in a natural hayfield (1983) Journal of Ecology, 71, pp. 379-390; Binkley, D., Hart, S.C., The components of nitrogen availability assessments in forest soils (1989) Advances in Soil Science, 10, pp. 57-112; Bowman, W.D., Inputs and storage of nitrogen in winter snowpack in an alpine ecosystem (1992) Arctic and Alpine Research, 24, pp. 211-215; Brooks, P.D., Williams, M.W., Schmidt, S.K., Inorganic nitrogen and microbial biomass dynamics before and during spring snowmelt (1998) Biogeochemistry, 43, pp. 1-15; Campbell, J.L., Mitchell, M.J., Groffman, P.M., Christenson, L.M., Hardy, J.P., Winter in northeastern North America: a critical period for ecological processes (2005) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 3, pp. 314-322; Chapin, F.S., Integrated responses of plants to stress (1991) Bioscience, 41, pp. 29-36; Chapin, F.S., Matson, P.A., Mooney, H.A., Terrestrial nutrient cycling (2002) Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology, pp. 197-223. , Springer-Verlag, Inc., New York, F.S.
