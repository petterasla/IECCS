As part of the survey on the effective use of carbon dioxide, taking the global environment into consideration, a study was carried out on the application of CO2 in EOR as a countermeasure to global warming. This paper studies the feasibility of a total system for the stabilization of CO2 using EOR. This system involves separation and recovery of CO2 from fixed sources in Japan, liquefaction and transportation to the oil-fields in oil producing countries, injection to the reservoir and eventual recovery and recycling. Utilization of CO2 for EOR therefore, not only increases oil production but also results in the stabilization of CO2, thus preventing further global warming. © 1992.","Carbon Dioxide; Exhaust Gases, Enhanced Oil Recovery, Carbon Dioxide Injection, Carbon Dioxide Recycling",,,,,,,"Moritis, CO2 and HC injection lead EOR production increase (1990) Oil & Gas Journal, pp. 49-82. , April 23","Tanaka, S.; The University of TokyoJapan",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
