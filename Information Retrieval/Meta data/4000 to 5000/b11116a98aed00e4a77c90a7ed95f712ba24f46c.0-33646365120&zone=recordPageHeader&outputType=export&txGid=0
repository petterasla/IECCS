These include a poor understanding of belowground productivity, the short duration of most analyses, and a need for greater examination of species- or community-specific variability in productivity studies. We quantified aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) over 3 years (1999-2001), and both belowground NPP (BNPP) and total NPP over 2 years (2000-2001) in both mesic and xeric site community types of the mixed mesophytic forest of southeastern Kentucky to examine landscape variability in productivity and its relation with soil resource [water and nitrogen (N)] availability. Across sites, ANPP was significantly correlated with N availability (R2 = 0.58, P = 0.028) while BNPP was best predicted by soil moisture content (R2 = 0.72, P = 0.008). Because of these offsetting patterns, total NPP was unrelated to either soil resource. Interannual variability in growing season precipitation during the study resulted in a 50% decline in mesic site litter production, possibly due to a lag effect following a moderate drought year in 1999. As a result, ANPP in mesic sites declined 27% in 2000 compared to 1999, while xeric sites had no aboveground production differences related to precipitation variability. If global climate change produces more frequent occurrences of drought, then the response of mesic sites to prolonged moisture deficiency and the consequences of shifting carbon (C) allocation on C storage will become important questions. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Carbon allocation; Interannual variability; Mesic; Mixed mesophytic forest; Nitrogen mineralization; Quercus, soil moisture; Total belowground carbon allocation; Xeric","belowground production; deciduous forest; ecosystem dynamics; intraspecific variation; landscape; mixed forest; primary production; soil moisture; temperate forest; Quercus",,,,,,"Abrams, M.D., Kubiske, M.E., Mostoller, S.A., Relating wet and dry year ecophysiology to leaf structure in contrasting temperate tree species (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 123-133; Adams, M.A., Attiwill, P.M., Nutrient cycling and nitrogen mineralization in eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia.
