This is particularly true in the UK where research funds have been diverted into BSE. Decline in interest in veterinary parasitology is at least in part due to the success of major pharmaceutical companies in producing a range of effective and safe anti-parasitic drugs. Research is needed because of the effects of parasites on animal welfare and the economic costs of parasites. However, there is little information on the actual costs of animal parasites. Another major reason for research is the development of drug resistance in protozoa, helminths and arthropods of veterinary importance. This is a serious problem particularly for sheep and goats in the southern hemisphere. A prioritised list of research requirements is suggested: (i) new drugs; (ii) resistance management; (iii) vaccines; (iv) breeding for resistance; (v) improved diagnostics; (vi) zoonoses; (vii) global warming and parasites. There is a major political challenge to raise the profile of veterinary parasitology and thus the funding essential for its advancement and the continued welfare and productivity of animals. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Animal welfare; Drug resistance; Economics; Parasiticides; Research requirements; Veterinary parasitology","anthelmintic agent; antiparasitic agent; avermectin derivative; benzimidazole derivative; imidazole derivative; thiazole derivative; vaccine; animal welfare; arthropod; breeding; drug resistance; drug safety; economic aspect; futurology; goat; greenhouse effect; helminth; horse; nonhuman; parasitology; protozoon; research; review; sheep; United Kingdom; veterinary medicine; Animal Welfare; Animals; Anthelmintics; Antiprotozoal Agents; Drug Resistance; Forecasting; Great Britain; Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Parasitology; Veterinary Medicine",,"Anthelmintics; Antiprotozoal Agents",,,,"Andrews, A.H., The farming crisis and animal welfare (2001) Vet.
