The use of solar greenhouses has greatly reduced energy demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Solar greenhouses are the best structure for growing winter horticultural crops in China, and have been adopted by countries such as Japan, Korea, and Russia. Increased proliferation of efficient solar greenhouses in China may contribute to solving worldwide problems such as the energy crisis and global climate change. This article summarizes the structure, function, application, and ecological benefits of energy-efficient, single-slope solar greenhouses in China, based on 20 years of systematic studies. We hope this technology can be applied to regions of similar climate to help reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions.","Back wall thickness; Carbon dioxide emissions; Co2; Global climate change; Low carbon production; Non-transparent insulation materials; Winter vegetables",,,,,,,"Chen, D.S., Distinct and climate must be considered in solar greenhouse building (2001) China Flowers Hort, 13, pp. 8-9. , In Chinese; Chen, M.S., Ma, S.P., Zhou, P.G., Li, J.W., Promoting modern vegetable production by implementation of an exportation policy (2007) China Veg, pp. 1-4. , 2007, In Chinese; Jiang, W.J., Qu, D.Y., Mu, D., Wang, L.R., Protected cultivation of horticultural crops in China (2004) Hort.
