To test the hypothesis that reduction in light availability can alleviate the harmful effects of soil flooding on photosynthesis, the authors studied the effects of soil flooding and acclimation from high to low light on the photosynthetic performance of Eugenia uniflora. Seedlings acclimated to full sunlight (about 35 mol m-2 d-1) for 5 months were transferred to partial sunlight (about 10 mol m-2d-1) and were either subjected to soil flooding or not flooded. Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured throughout the flooding period and leaf gas exchange was measured 16 days after flooding was initiated. Minimal fluorescence yield (Fo) was significantly higher and the quantum efficiency of open PSII centres (Fv/Fm) was significantly lower in flooded than in non-flooded plants in full sunlight. Sixteen days after flooding was initiated, stomatal conductance (gssat) and net photosyntheses expressed on a leaf area (Asat-area), weight (Asat-wt) and chlorophyll (Asat-Chl) basis decreased in response to soil flooding. Flooding decreased stomatal conductance by similar amounts in full and partial sunlight, but Asat-area in partial and full sunlight was 3. 4 and 16. 8 times lower, respectively, in flooded than in non-flooded plants. These results indicate that changes from full to partial sunlight during soil flooding can alleviate the effects of flooding stress on photosynthesis in E. uniflora seedlings acclimated to full sunlight. The responses of photosynthesis in trees to flooding stress may be dependent on changes in light environment during heavy rains. © 2011 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Global change; Leaf gas exchange; Stomatal conductance","Eugenia uniflora",,,,,,"Aranda, I., Pardo, F., Gil, L., Pardos, J.A., Anatomical basis of the change in leaf mass per area and nitrogen investment with relative irradiance within the canopy of eight temperate tree species (2004) Acta Oecol, 25, pp. 187-195; Baker, N.R., Chlorophyll fluorescence: a probe of photosynthesis in vivo (2008) Annu Rev Plant Biol, 59, pp. 89-113; Bongers, F., Popma, J., Leaf dynamics of seedlings of rain forest species in relation to canopy gaps (1990) Oecologia, 82, pp. 122-127; Davanso, V.M., Souza, L.A., Medri, M.E., Pimenta, J.A., Bianchini, E., Photosynthesis, growth and development of Tabebuia avellanedae Lor. ex Griseb.
