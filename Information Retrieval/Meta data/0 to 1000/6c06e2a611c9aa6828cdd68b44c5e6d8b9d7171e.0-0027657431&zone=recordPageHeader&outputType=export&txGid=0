Biomass can act as a reservoir of carbon, or as a direct substitute for fossil fuels with no net contribution to atmospheric CO2 if produced and used sustainably. We examine the role of biomass in mitigating global warming and contributing to the development of future energy strategies. We conclude that the use of biomass for fossil fuel substitution would be far more effective in reducing atmospheric CO2 than to simply sequester CO2 in forests in most circumstances. Furthermore, since bioenergy could be less costly than coal and petroleum, this strategy has an economic advantage over many of the carbon mitigation options. Photobiology and photochemistry are possible future routes for CO2 reduction. The use of microalgae in photobioreactors is feasible for CO2 removal as has been demonstrated in a number of laboratories. Energy balances with such systems need to be optimised since parameters such as light (actual and artificial) and waste heat play crucial roles. © 1993.","bioenergy; Biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; fossil fuel substitution; photobiology","Air pollution control; Atmospheric composition; Biomass; Biosynthesis; Photosynthesis; Renewable energy resources; Biofuels; Biological disposal systems; Carbon dioxide disposal; Fossil fuel substitution; Photobiology; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Alpert, Spencer, Hidy, Biospheric options for mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (1992) Energy Conservation and Management, 33 (5-8), pp. 729-736; Bekkering, Using Tropical Forests to fix Atmospheric Carbon: the potential in Theory and Practice (1992) Ambio, 21, pp. 414-419; Beyea, Cook, Hall, Socolow, Williams, (1991) Toward Ecological Guidelines for Large-Scale Biomass Energy Development, , National Audobon Society, NY, In press; Brown, Brough, Flavin, French, Jacobson, Lenssen, Lowe, Young, (1989) State of the World 1989, pp. 174-194. , W.
