Soil care is proposed as a unifying concept and challenge for geoecological sustainability. It is defined as the activity of selecting and implementing, locally and regionally, a system of soil and land use management suitable for maintaining and improving soil usefulness and quality for any selected purpose. In developing countries where, in addition, improvement of soil productivity will remain the major goal, more locally trained soil scientists will be needed to increase their relative proportion among the current number of some 50 000 soil scientists worldwide and to narrow the gap in research efforts.",,"land use; plant growth; soil productivity; soil science; soil scientist; soil survey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030456162
