Bioenergy, the energy from biomass, has been used for thousands of years, ever since people started burning wood to cook food, and today wood is still our largest biomass resource for bioenergy. The use of bioenergy has the potential to greatly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Replacing fossil fuels with energy from biomass has several distinct environmental implications. If biomass is harvested at a rate that is sustainable, using it for energy purposes does not result in any net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs), and state emissions are significant on a global scale. CO 2 and CO are the main greenhouse gases associated with global warning. At the present time, coal is responsible for 30-40% of world CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels. SO2 and NOx contribute to acid rain. Carbon assessments can play an important role in a strategy to control carbon dioxide emissions while raising revenue.","Bioenergy; Biomass; Biomass technology; Environment; Global warning","Acid rain; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Plants (botany); Sulfur dioxide; Wind power; Wood; Bioenergy; Biomass technology; Biomass",,,,,,"Bhattacharya, S.C., Abdul Salam, P., Low greenhouse gas biomass options for cooking in the developing countries (2002) Biomass Bioenergy, 22, pp. 305-317; Cuff, D.J., Young, W.J., (1980) US Energy Atlas, , NY: Free Press/McMillan Publishing Co; Demirbaş, A., A new method on wood liquefaction (1985) Chim Acta Turc, 13, pp. 363-368; Demirbaş, A., Biomass resources for energy and chemical industry (2000) Energy Edu Sci Technol, 5, pp. 21-45; Demirbaş, A., Recent advances in biomass conversion technologies (2000) Energy Edu Sci Technol, 6, pp. 19-40; Demirbaş, A., Conversion of biomass to a pyrolytic oil for blending gasoline as alternative fuel in internal combustion engines (2001) Energy Sources, 23, pp. 553-562; Dincer, I., Environmental issues: I - Energy utilization (2001) Energy Sources, 23, pp. 69-81; (1999) International Energy Annual, , Energy Information Administration; (1996) The Future for Renewable Energy, Prospects and Directions, , London: James & James Science Publishers Ltd; Hall, D.O., Rosillo-Calle, F., Williams, R.H., Woods, J., Biomass energy supply and prospects (1993) Renewable Energy: Sources for Fuel and Electricity, pp. 593-651. , Johansson, T.
