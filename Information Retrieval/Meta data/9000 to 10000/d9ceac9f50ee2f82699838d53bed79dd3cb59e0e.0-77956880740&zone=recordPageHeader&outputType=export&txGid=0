This paper analyzes the energy consumptions of a conventional separation production (SP) system and a BCHP system respectively and constructs their corresponding environmental impact models. Furthermore, three energy-related environmental issues, global warming, acid precipitation and stratospheric ozone depletion, are assessed in the proposed emission model. To maximize the benefits (energy-saving and emission-reducing) achieved by the BCHP system in comparison to the SP system, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to optimize the capacity of BCHP system in consideration of its operation mode. A numerical case of BCHP system for a hotel building is applied to ascertain the effectiveness of the optimal method and demonstrate the performances of the optimal BCHP system. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Building cooling heating and power (BCHP) system; Energy saving; Environment impact; Genetic algorithm (GA); Optimization","Acid precipitation; Building cooling; Design and operations; Emission model; Energy saving; Environment impact; Environmental issues; Environmental performance; Heating and power; Hotel building; Operation mode; Optimal methods; Optimization design; Save energy; Stratospheric ozone depletion; Air pollution; Cooling; Energy conservation; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Heating; Optimization; Ozone; Ozone layer; Precipitation (meteorology); Structural design; Environmental impact; acid precipitation; building; cooling; energetics; environmental impact; experimental design; genetic algorithm; global warming; heating; numerical model; optimization; ozone; performance assessment",,,,,,"Hofman, K., Li, X., Canada's energy perspectives and policies for sustainable development (2009) Applied Energy, 86 (4), pp. 407-415; Bilgen, S., Keles, S., Kaygusuz, A., SarI, A., Kaygusuz, K., Global warming and renewable energy sources for sustainable development: a case study in Turkey (2008) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 12 (2), pp. 372-396; Pereira, A.O., Soares, J.B., de Oliveira, R.G., de Queiroz, R.P., Energy in Brazil: toward sustainable development?
