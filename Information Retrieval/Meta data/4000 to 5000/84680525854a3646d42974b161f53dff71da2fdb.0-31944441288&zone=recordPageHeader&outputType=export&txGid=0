On an interactive, user-friendly website, CARA has amassed data on climate (historical records and future projections for seven global climate models), land cover, and socioeconomic and environmental variables, along with tools to help decisionmakers tailor the data for their own decision types and locations. CARA Advisory Council stakeholders help identify what information and tools stakeholders would find most useful and how to present these; they also provide in-depth feedback for subregion case studies. General lessons include: (1) decisionmakers want detailed local projections for periods short enough to account for extreme events, in contrast to the broader spatial and temporal observations and projections that are available or consistent at a regional level; (2) stakeholders will not use such a website unless it is visually appealing and easy to find the information they want; (3) some stakeholders need background while others want to go immediately to data, and some want maps while others want text or tables. This article also compares what has been learned across case studies of Cape May County, New Jersey, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Hampton Roads, Virginia, relating specifically to sea-level rise. Lessons include: (1) groups can be affected differently by physical dangers compared with economic dangers; (2) decisions will differ according to decision makers' preferences about waiting and risk tolerance; (3) future scenarios and maps can help assess the impacts of dangers to emergency evacuation routes, homes, and infrastructure, and the natural environment; (4) residents' and decisionmakers' perceptions are affected by information about potential local impacts from global climate change. © 2005 Society for Risk Analysis.","Climate change; Climate projections; Community decisionmaking; Decision support; Land-use change; Local case studies; Stakeholder participation","Climate change; Climatology; Decision making; Decision support systems; Land use; Mathematical models; Websites; Climate projections; Community decisionmaking; Land-use change; Local case studies; Stakeholder participation; Risk assessment; adaptation; climate change; information; risk assessment; Atlantic Ocean; climate change; decision support system; flooding; global climate; greenhouse effect; habitat fragmentation; land use; policy; population distribution; quality of life; review; risk assessment; sea level; socioeconomics; United States; North America; United States",,,,,,"Bawden, R.J., Macadam, R.D., Packham, R.J., Valentine, I., Systems thinking and practices in the education of agriculturalists (1984) Agricultural Systems, 13, pp. 205-225; Beierle, T.C., Cayford, J., (2002) Democracy in Practice: Public Participation in Environmental Decisions, , Washington, DC: Resources for the Future; Blaikie, P., Cannon, T., Davis, I., Wisner, B., (1994) At Risk: Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability, and Disasters, , London: Routledge; Boon, J., (2005) Sea Coast and Sea Level Trends, , http://ccrm.vims.edu/cara_web/case%20studies_files/ SEA%20COAST%20AND%20SEA%20LEVEL%20TRENDS%203.pdf; Bord, R.J., Fisher, A., O'Connor, R.E., Public perceptions of global warming: United States and international perspectives (1998) Climate Research, 11 (1), pp. 75-84; Bord, R.J., O'Connor, R.E., Fisher, A., In what sense does the public need to understand global climate change?
