Among the many plausible choices, dangerous interference with the climate system may be interpreted as anthropogenic radiative forcing causing distinct and widespread climate change impacts such as a widespread demise of coral reefs or a disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The geological record and numerical models suggest that limiting global warming below critical temperature thresholds significantly reduces the likelihood of these eventualities. Here we analyze economically optimal policies that may ensure this risk-reduction. Reducing the risk of a widespread coral reef demise implies drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within decades. Virtually unchecked greenhouse gas emissions to date (combined with the inertia of the coupled natural and human systems) may have already committed future societies to a widespread demise of coral reefs. Policies to reduce the risk of a West Antarctic ice sheet disintegration allow for a smoother decarbonization of the economy within a century and may well increase consumption in the long run. © Springer 2005.",,"Ecology; Gas emissions; Geology; Greenhouse effect; Ice; Mathematical models; Reefs; Risk management; Anthropogeny; Climate system; Greenhouse gas emissions; Risk-reduction; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; climate change; coral reef; environmental impact; global change; greenhouse gas; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Andronova, N.G., Schlesinger, M.E., Objective estimation of the probability density function for climate sensitivity (2001) J.
