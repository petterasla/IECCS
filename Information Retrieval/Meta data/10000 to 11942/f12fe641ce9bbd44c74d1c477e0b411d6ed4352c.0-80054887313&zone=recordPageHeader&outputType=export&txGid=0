Birds were captured between 1960 and 2007 at a banding station in southern Rhode Island. We detected annual trends in the highest ranked models with mean capture dates of seven species significantly delayed by an average of 3.0 days per decade; 38% of long-distance migrants and 50% of short-distance migrants studied significantly delayed migration. We found no evidence of long-term shifts in autumn migration timing for seven species and mean capture dates of five species exhibited non-linear annual trends. Mean autumn temperature was an important factor in explaining annual trends for eight species. Changes in annual capture rates for some species may have an equal or greater role than year or temperature in explaining long-term trends in autumn migration timing. Our analysis suggests that some migratory bird species are now departing the region later than in the 1960s. Important differences among species and regions are likely to influence species-specific responses to changes in climate patterns. © 2011 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.",,"capture method; climate effect; date (time); ecosystem response; interspecific variation; long-term change; migratory species; songbird; spatial variation; stopover; trend analysis; Rhode Island; United States; Aves; Passeri",,,,,,"Bairlein, F., Huppop, O., Migratory Fuelling and Global Climate Change (2004) Advances in Ecological Research, 35, pp. 33-47. , DOI 10.1016/S0065-2504(04)35002-6, PII S0065250404350026, Birds and Climate Change; Both, C., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.W., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multi-Model Inference: A Practical Information Theoretic Approach, , Springer-Verlag, New York USA; Cotton, P.A., Avian migration phenology and global climate change (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100 (21), pp. 12219-12222. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.1930548100; Gienapp, P., Leimu, R., Merila, J., Responses to climate change in avian migration time - Microevolution versus phenotypic plasticity (2007) Climate Research, 35 (1-2), pp. 25-35. , DOI 10.3354/cr00712; Gordo, O., Why are bird migration dates shifting?
