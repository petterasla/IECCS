The particle dynamics induced by intense typhoons in a deep subtropical reservoir are investigated by conducting weekly sampling of settling particles at depths of 20m and 70m collected from sediment traps, as well as biweekly sampling of total suspended matter (TSM) from the water column, for a period of 406days, during which seven typhoons visited. It is observed that intensive typhoon events trigger the increase of settling flux to an amount that is one order of magnitude higher than the amount of the flux during normal days. The non-typhoon related weather events with high precipitations intriguingly did not induce a significantly high increase in settling flux or in TSM. An empirical ""after typhoon"" decay pattern of settling flux is observed which follows a first order relation, where a decay constant of 0.08d -1 is found. The predicted settling fluxes obtained using this empirical relation fit the measured data rather well. The influence of intense typhoons on particle dynamics in a deep inland water system can be understood as the joint effect of erosion on a land surface resulting from powerful winds and high runoff resulting from high levels of precipitation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Settling particles; Subtropical; Total suspended matter; Typhoon","Aquatic system; Decay constants; Decay patterns; Deep reservoirs; Empirical relations; Extreme weather events; First order; Global climate changes; Inland waters; Joint effect; Land surface; Measured data; Particle dynamics; Settling fluxes; Settling particles; Subtropical; Total suspended matter; Typhoon; Water columns; Weather events; Anoxic sediments; Climate change; Reservoirs (water); Suspended sediments; Weather information services; Hurricanes; erosion; extreme event; global change; land surface; particulate flux; precipitation intensity; reservoir; runoff; sediment trap; settling velocity; subtropical region; suspended load; typhoon; water column; wind forcing",,,,,,"Alavian, V., Jirka, G.H., Denton, R.A., Johnson, M.C., Stefan, H.G., Density currents entering lakes and reservoirs (1992) Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 118, p. 1464; Bloesch, J., Mechanisms, measurement and importance of sediment resuspension in lakes (1995) Marine and Freshwater Research, 46, pp. 295-304; Bloesch, J., Towards a new generation of sediment traps and a better measurement/understanding of settling particulate flux in lakes and oceans: a hydrodynamic protocol (1996) Aquatic Science, 58, pp. 283-296; Buesseler, K.O., Antia, A.N., Chen, M., Fowler, S.W., Gardner, W.D., Gustafsson, O., Harada, K., Trull, T., An assessment of the use of sediment traps for estimating upper ocean particle fluxes (2007) Journal of Marine Research, 65, pp. 345-416; Chen, Y.-J., Wu, S.C., Effects of sediment phosphorus release associated with the density current on water quality of a subtropical and deep reservoir in Taiwan (2003) Water Science and Technology, 48, pp. 151-158; Effler, S.W., Matthews, D.A., Sediment resuspension and drawdown in a water supply reservoir (2004) Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 40, pp. 251-264; Effler, S.W., Matthews, D.A., Kaser, J.W., Prestigiacomo, A.R., Smith, D.G., Runoff event impacts on a water supply reservoir: suspended sediment loading, turbid plume behavior, and sediment deposition (2006) Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 42, pp. 1697-1710; Fan, C.W., Kao, S.J., Effects of climate events driven hydrodynamics on dissolved oxygen in a subtropical deep reservoir in Taiwan (2008) Science of the Total Environment, 393, pp. 326-332; Gaye, B., Fahl, K., Kodina, L.A., Lahajnar, N., Nagel, B., Unger, D., Gebhardt, A.C., Particulate matter fluxes in the southern and central Kara Sea compared to sediments: Bulk fluxes, amino acids, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, sterols and fatty acids (2007) Continental Shelf Research, 27, pp. 2570-2594; Hanson, P.C., Bade, D.L., Carpenter, S., Lake metabolism: relationships with dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus (2003) Limnology and Oceanography, 48, pp. 1112-1119; Hicks, D.M., Gomez, B., Trustrum, N.A., Erosion thresholds and suspended sediment yields, waipaoa river basin, New Zealand (2000) Water Resources Research, 36, pp. 1129-1142; Kuo, J.-T., Liu, W.-C., Lin, R.-T., Lung, W.-S., Yang, M.-D., Yang, C.-P., Chu, S.-C., Water quality modeling for the feitsui reservoir in northern Taiwan (2003) Journal of American Water Resources Association, 39, pp. 671-687; Nakatsuka, T., Masuzawa, T., Kanda, J., Kitazato, H., Shirayama, Y., Shimanaga, M., Yamaoka, A., Particle dynamics in the deep water column of Sagami Bay, Japan.
