Unprecedented efforts have been made to reduce the global emissions of CFCs. Major industries, which are competing within the modern global economy, have recognized the importance of maintaining a 'green' perspective. Future operations will be designed to reduce the direct emissions of chemical by-products to air, water and soil, and to recycle and to reuse critical solvents such as water. 'Star Wars' technologies for the rapid, economical and effective elimination of industrial and domestic wastes will be developed and employed on a large scale. Advanced technologies for the control and monitoring of chemical pollutants on regional and global scales will be developed and implemented. Satellite-based instruments will be able to detect, to quantify, and to monitor a wide range of chemical pollutants. Our understanding of the fate and consequences of chemicals in the environment will increase dramatically such that we shall be able to predict the environmental, ecological and biochemical consequences of novel synthetic molecules with much greater precision.",,"air pollutant; article; chemical industry; forecasting; history; history of medicine; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Chemical Industry; Forecasting; History of Medicine, 19th Cent.; History of Medicine, 20th Cent.; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"Air Pollutants, Occupational",,,,,"Hoffmann, M.R.",,,,,,,,03005208,,,8222994,"English","Ciba Found Symp",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027346722
