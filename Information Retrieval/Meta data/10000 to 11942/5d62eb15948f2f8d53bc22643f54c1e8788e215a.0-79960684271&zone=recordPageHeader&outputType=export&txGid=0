The singular value decomposition (SVD) of observational data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change simulations in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) shows that the observed TC track changes are linked to the leading SVD mode of global sea surface temperature (SST) warming and the associated changes in large-scale steering flows. The selected five IPCC models can generally simulate the leading mode in their ensemble control run and prediction, suggesting the possible persistence of the reported track changes by 2040. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Trends; Tropical cyclones","Climate change simulations; East Asia; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Observational data; Sea surface temperatures; South China Sea; Steering flow; Track changes; Trends; Tropical cyclone; Tropical cyclones; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Hurricanes; Storms; Tropics; Singular value decomposition; climate change; ensemble forecasting; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; sea surface temperature; subtropical region; trend analysis; tropical cyclone; typhoon; Far East; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",,,,,,"Chan, J.C.L., Shi, J., Long-term trends and interannual variability in tropical cyclone activity over the western North Pacific (1996) Geophys.
