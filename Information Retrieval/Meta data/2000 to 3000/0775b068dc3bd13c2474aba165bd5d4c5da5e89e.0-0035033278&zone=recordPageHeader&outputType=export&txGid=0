This study investigates effects of climatic change on regional water demand and supply as well as the economy in the San Antonio Texas Edwards Aquifer region. This is done using a regional model which portrays both hydrological and economic activities. The overall results indicate that changes in climatic conditions reduce water resource availability and increase water demand. Specifically, a regional welfare loss of $2.2-$6.8 million per year may occur as a result of climatic change. Additionally, if springflows are to be maintained at the currently desired level to protect endangered species, pumping must be reduced by 9-20% at an additional cost of $0.5 to $2 million per year.",,"Economic and social effects; Springs (water); Water resources; Water supply; Water demand; Climate change; aquifer; climate change; economic analysis; water demand; United States",,,,,,"Box, G.E.P., Cox, D.R., An Analysis of Transformations (1964) J.
