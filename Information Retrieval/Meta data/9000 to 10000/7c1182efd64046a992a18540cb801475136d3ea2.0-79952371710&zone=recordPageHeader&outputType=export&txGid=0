Determining the current trend of global temperature variation has become one of the critical issues in climate change research. Obviously, it is rather important to develop new climate change detection technology in order to identify new characteristics of the global warming. This review introduces the latest advances and past achievements on the climate change detection technology in China with emphases on new detection methods in the following five aspects: (1) abrupt climate change detection, (2) signal separation and extraction from observed data, (3) intrinsic complexity of the climate system, (4) recognition of the dynamical characteristics of the climate system, and (5) definitions and detection of extreme events. At last, some cruxes and key problems in the current climate change detection technology research are briefly discussed.","Abrupt climate change; Detection method; Dynamical structure characteristic; Extreme climate events","air temperature; climate change; complexity; detection method; extreme event; global warming; literature review; China",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Tett, S.F.B., Checking for model consistency in optimal fingerprinting (1999) Climate Dynamics, 15, pp. 419-434; Beniston, M., Stephenson, D.B., Christensen, O.B., Future extreme events in European climate: An exploration of regional climate model projections (2007) Climatic Change, 81 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 71-95; Bernaola-Galvan, P., Ivanov, P.C., Amaral, L.A.N., Scale invariance in nonstationarity of human heart rate (2001) Phys.
