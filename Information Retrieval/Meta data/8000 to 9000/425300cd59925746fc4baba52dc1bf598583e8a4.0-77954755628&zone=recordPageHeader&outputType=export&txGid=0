Further, to establish if the pollution, particularly of nitrogen and phosphates (often associated with cultivations and use of mineral fertilisers) could be reduced or eliminated, so as to be able to develop systems which could contribute to the reversal of global warming. Finally, to probe whether practical operators on the ground could understand the technology, use it, and express what they were doing in a way acceptable to a wider society. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.","Biofuels; Global warming; Wastes","Agricultural crops; Closed loops; Energy crops; Fertilisers; Sustainable operations; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Energy harvesting; Global warming; Industrial wastes; Oxygen; Energy conversion",,,,,,"Butterworth, B., Relevant Technology (2009) Reversing Global Warming for Profit, pp. 40-44. , MX Publishing: London, UK; Butterworth, B., Appendix (2009) How to Make On-Farm Composting Work, pp. 175-183. , MX Publishing: London, UK; Butterworth, B., (2008) Clamping Down on Compost, pp. 13-14. , American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers: St. Joseph, MI, USA; Butterworth, B., (1998) Waste in the Next Millennium, pp. 11-12. , American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers: St. Joseph, MI, USA; Butterworth, B., (1999) A top idea that holds water, pp. 4-5. , WET News, UK, 6 October; Butterworth, B., Nitrate Nonsense (2002) Landwards; Institution of Agricultural Engineers, pp. 6-7. , Bedford, UK; Butterworth, B., (2009) How to Make On-Farm Composting Work, pp. 19-34. , MX Publishing: London, UK; Butterworth, W.R., (2009) Sustainable Biofuel Production Derived from Urban Waste Using PSCC, , Biofpr, Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley and Sons Ltd: London, UK","Butterworth, W.R.; Land Network International Ltd, Devizes, SN10 2ES, United Kingdom; email: bill@landnetwork.co.uk",,,,,,,,19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954755628
