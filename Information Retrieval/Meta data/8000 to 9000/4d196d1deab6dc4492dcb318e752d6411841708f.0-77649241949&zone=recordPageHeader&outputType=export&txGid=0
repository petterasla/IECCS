Invasive earthworms, exotic tree pests, and deer overabundance will magnify the impacts of warmer temperatures. Seldom do we assess potential threats to ecosystem and wilderness integrity in a systematic way and develop policy and management strategies ahead of time to mitigate the situation. Debates on several issues involving wilderness users, managers, and scientists need to be resolved for the BWCAW. These include whether, when, and how to: (1) use fire; (2) restore tree species to wilderness areas lost through human actions (e.g., logging of white pine (Pinus strobus L.) that occurred before wilderness designation and potential loss of ash species from the introduced pest emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire)); (3) manage the potential overabundance of deer that threaten reproduction of some tree species; (4) facilitate (or prevent) migration of new tree species currently native south of the wilderness; (5) employ local (within wilderness) or regional assisted migration for species that cannot migrate fast enough on their own to keep up with climate change; and (6) manage invasive species. Some of these activities would not be allowed under the wilderness laws of 1964 and 1978, and may be difficult to enact or limited in effectiveness. Major change in forests of the BWCAW is a certainty, and facilitation of a 'graceful transition' to native species rather than exotic species is desirable.","Assisted migration; Boreal forest; Climate change; Savanna; Wilderness management","abundance; boreal forest; coniferous tree; crop pest; deer; earthworm; fire behavior; global warming; habitat conservation; invasive species; management practice; migratory behavior; policy making; restoration ecology; savanna; temperate forest; wilderness area; Minnesota; United States; Agrilus planipennis; Cervidae; Pinus strobus",,,,,,"Alverson, W.S., Waller, D.M., Solheim, S.L., Forests too deer: Edge effects in northern Wisconsin (1988) Conservation Biology, 2, pp. 348-358; Barber, V.A., Juday, G.P., Finney, B.P., Reduced growth of Alaskan white spruce in the twentieth century from temperature induced drought stress (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 668-673; Bergeron, Y., Archambault, S., Decreasing frequency of forest fires in the southern boreal forest zone of Quebec and its relation to global warming since the end of the 'Little Ice Age' (1993) Holocene, 3, pp. 255-259; Christensen, J.H., B.
