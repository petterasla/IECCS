An increase in temperature from five to 25°C resulted in a 314% increase in bioconcentration factor (the ratio of contaminant concentration in the organism to contaminant concentration in the water). Animals were exposed to 25°C for 12 h in the light, then 15°C for 12 h in the dark. Exposure to this fluctuating temperature regime for 48 h resulted in a 27-33% increase in bioconcentration factor relative to a constant 20°C control. Live animals accumulated more than twice the amount of DDE than freshly killed animals, ie the activity of the organism is important in bioconcentration. Daphnia pump more water through their branchial chambers at higher temperatures. Thus, if the thoracic limbs are an important site of contaminant uptake, then animals are exposed to more contaminant molecules at higher temperatures. Other possible mechanisms include changes in the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer and changes in cell membrane permeability. -from Authors",,"bioconcentration; DDE; temperature; Animalia; Cladocera; Daphnia; Daphnia pulex; Pulex; Daphnia spp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029189026
