Their forefields have become interesting sites to study primary microbial colonisation and microbial adaptation. Here, the structure and enzyme activity of microbial communities in exposed rock substrates and their changes in a gradient of temperature and soil moisture conditions within the forefield of the Damma glacier in the Swiss Central Alps are discussed. The temperature at the sites differed in the course of a day and also showed differing mean temperatures over the summer. Distinct bacterial communities inhabit the differing sites at the beginning of the experiment and even after transplantation they stay distinct. But a seasonal shift in the communities could be observed, which followed the same pattern for all the samples. Interestingly, microbial enzyme activity was highest at the site with the smallest temperature shifts. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Alpine glacier; Bacterial community; Central Alps; Colonisation; Gradient of temperature; Mean temperature; Microbial adaptation; Microbial communities; Microbial enzymes; Moisture conditions; Seasonal shifts; Temperature shift; Glaciers; Global warming; Microorganisms; Soil moisture; Enzyme activity; adaptation; bacterium; colonization; enzyme activity; global warming; microbial activity; microbial community; soil ecosystem; soil moisture; substrate; temperature effect; temporal variation; transplantation; valley glacier; Damma Glacier; Switzerland; Uri; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,,,,,"Bell, C., McIntyre, N., Cox, S., Tissue, D., Zak, J., Soil microbial responses to temporal variations of moisture and temperature in a Chihuahuan Desert Grassland (2008) Microbiol.
