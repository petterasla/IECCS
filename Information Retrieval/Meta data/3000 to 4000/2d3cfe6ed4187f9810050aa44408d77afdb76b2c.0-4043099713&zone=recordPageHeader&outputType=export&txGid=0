An ecological crisis involving desertification, soil erosion, degradation of land quality, loss of biodiversity and global climate change has been brought about all over the world. In order to manage ecosystems efficiently, it is necessary to assess ecological risk at multiple scales. Ecological risk is the probability that a region and/or site will experience defined ecological or environmental problems. In this paper, the ecological risks of soil erosion, desertification, and acid deposition have been assessed on a national scale according to natural and human factors, such as topography, soil, vegetation and climate. This assessment has provided very useful information for ecological environmental management in China.","Acid deposition; China; Desertification; Ecological assessment; Soil erosion","acid deposition; desertification; ecosystem management; environmental degradation; risk assessment; soil erosion; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,,,,,"Ayensu, E., Claasen, D.R., Collins, M., International ecosystem assessment (1999) Science, 286, pp. 685-686; (1997) China Country Paper to Combat Desertification, , Beijing: China Forestry Publishing House; Chen, Z., (1997) Research of Acid Rain in China, , Beijing: China Environmental Science Press (in Chinese); (1997) China Resources, , National People's Congress.
