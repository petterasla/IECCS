The next crisis will most likely emerge out of excess of supply. The solutions that were contemplated in the 1970s are still very relevant. We will focus here on human contributions to changes in the atmospheric chemical composition that will most likely have a major impact on the global climate. The key issue addressed is the prediction of the possibility that the system will self-adjust to achieve sustainable development and thus immunize us from the consequences of wrong decisions. We conclude with a presentation of a computer model that greatly accelerates the cause-effect choices that we make and incorporates renewable energy supply as an important part of the solution. © 2005 Académie des sciences.
