Our model area has been represented by the valleys: Vajsková and Lomnistá in Low Tatras Mts region. The suitability of the current and future changed climatic conditions for particular species has been assessed by means of the analysis of the bioclimatic area of each examined tree species. The analysis has been done for the tree species as follows: Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), mountain pine (Pinus mugo), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), European larch (Larix decidua), mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) and cembra pine (Pinus cembra). The results hint at the possibility of considerable changes in the tree composition of mountain forests in the future. The climatic changes will probably have a negative impact primarily on silver fir, Norway spruce and mountain pine - important commercial and stand building species. The effects of the climatic changes are also expected on other species.","Bioclimatic area; Climate change; Mountain forests; Site suitability; Tree species composition","bioclimatology; climate change; community composition; forest ecosystem; global change; tree; Carpathians; Central Europe; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Low Tatra Mountains; Slovakia; World; Abies; Abies alba; Acer; Acer pseudoplatanus; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Fraxinus; Fraxinus excelsior; Larix; Larix decidua; Picea; Picea abies; Pinus cembra; Pinus mugo; Sorbus; Sorbus aucuparia",,,,,,"Huntley, B., Bartlein, P.J., Prentice, I.C., Climatic Control of the Distribution and Abundance of Beech (Fagus L.) in Europe and North America (1989) Journal of Biogeography, 16, pp. 551-560; Lapin, M., Melo, I., Damborská, I., Gera, M., Faško, P., (2000) New Climate Change Scenarios for Slovakia Based on Outputs from Global Circulation Models (in Slovak), pp. 5-34. , National Climate Programme of the Slovak Republic, NKP 8/00; Mind'áš, J., Škvarenina, J., (1994) Possible Impacts of Climatic Change on Forest Ecosystems (in Slovak), pp. 57-82. , National Climate Programme of the Slovak Republic, NKP 1/94, Bratislava; Mind'áš, J., Lapin, M., Škvarenina, J., (1996) Climate Change and Slovak Forests (in Slovak), 98p. , National Climate Programme of the Slovak Republic.
