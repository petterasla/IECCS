However, observational limitations have hindered a direct evaluation of model-projected changes in extreme precipitation. We used satellite observations and model simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content. These observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods. Furthermore, the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than that predicted by models, implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.",,"rain; amplification; atmospheric moisture; climate modeling; climate prediction; global warming; human activity; precipitation intensity; satellite imagery; warming; article; atmosphere; climate change; computer simulation; correlation coefficient; greenhouse effect; precipitation; priority journal; telecommunication; temperature sensitivity; thermodynamics",,,,,,"Meehl, G., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
