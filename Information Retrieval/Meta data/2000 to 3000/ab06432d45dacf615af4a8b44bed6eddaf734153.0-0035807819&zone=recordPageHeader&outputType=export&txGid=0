Over the last 30 years, the genetically controlled photoperiodic response of the pitcherplant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, has shifted toward shorter, more southern daylengths as growing seasons have become longer. This shift is detectable over a time interval as short as 5 years. Faster evolutionary response has occurred in northern populations where selection is stronger and genetic variation is greater than in southern populations. W. smithii represents an example of actual genetic differentiation of a seasonality trait that is consistent with an adaptive evolutionary response to recent global warming.",,"article; evolution; gene control; genetic variability; greenhouse effect; mosquito; nonhuman; phenotype; photoperiodicity; priority journal; season; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Culicidae; Evolution; Greenhouse Effect; North America; Photoperiod; Seasons; Time Factors",,,,,,"Stott, P.A., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, G.S., Allen, M.R., Mitchell, J.F.B., Jenkins, G.J., (2000) Science, 290, pp. 2133-2137; Easterling, D.R., Meehl, G.A., Parmesan, C., Changnon, S.A., Karl, T.R., Mearns, L.O., (2000) Science, 289, pp. 2068-2074; DeGaetano, A.T., (1996) J.
