The evidence for anthropogenic activity in pollen diagrams has focused on indirect indicators such as forest clearance, burning and increases in arable weeds. Tracing individual cultivars has proven to be very difficult as the major cultivated plants, in this case dominated by root crops, have low pollen production, are insect-pollinated or are harvested before flowering occurs. The identification of some cultivars is further restricted by limited information on pollen morphology. The pollen morphology of selected species from two genera (Pandanus and Colocasia), known to include important cultivated species, have been studied. Five pollen taxa are recognised after examination by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It is shown that these can be easily distinguished on the broad criteria of pollen class, grain size and size of echini. The taxonomic and dispersal characteristics of the pollen morphology of these taxa are discussed and the implications of improved identification of cultivated species in late Quaternary pollen records are considered. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Colocasia; Early agriculture; New Guinea; Pandanus; Pollen morphology",,,,,,,"Anderson, J.A.R., Muller, J., Palynological study of a Holocene peat and a Miocene coal deposit from NW Borneo (1975) Rev Palaeobot Palynol, 19, pp. 291-351; Bartlett, A.S., Barghoorn, E.S., Phytogeographic history of the Isthmus of Panama during the past 12,000 years (a history of vegetation, climate and sea-level change) (1973) Vegetation and vegetational history of northern Latin America, pp. 203-299. , A., Graham, Elsevier, Amsterdam; Chappell, J., Thom, B.G., Sea levels and coasts (1977) Sunda and Sahul: prehistoric studies in southeast Asia, Melanesia and Australia, pp. 275-291. , J., Allen, J., Golson, R., Jones, Academic Press, London; Cleghorn, M.L., Notes on the pollination of Colocasia antiquorum (1913) J Asiat Soc Bengal, 9, pp. 313-315; Cox, P.A., Pollination and the evolution of breeding systems in Pandanaceae (1990) Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 77, pp. 816-840; Cranwell, L.M., New Zealand pollen studies.
