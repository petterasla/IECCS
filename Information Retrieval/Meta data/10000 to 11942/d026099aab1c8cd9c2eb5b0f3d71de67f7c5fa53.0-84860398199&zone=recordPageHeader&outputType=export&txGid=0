Little information is available about the effects of global warming and grazing on different forms of C and N pools in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of warming and grazing on the sizes of different soil labile C and N pools and N transformation in this region. Materials and methods A free-air temperature enhancement system in a controlled warming-grazing experiment had been implemented since May 2006. Infrared heaters were used to manipulate temperature, and a moderate grazing intensity was simulated by Tibetan sheep. After 3 years' warming, soil samples were taken from the four treatment plots no warming with no grazing; no warming with grazing; warming with no grazing; and warming with grazing. Concentrations of inorganic N in the 40-cm soil profiles were measured by a flow injection analyser. Microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN) were measured by the fumigation-extraction method, and soluble organic C (SOC) and soluble organic N (SON) were determined by high-temperature catalytic oxidation. Total N (TN), C isotope composition (δ13C) and N isotope composition (δ15N) were determined using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Net N transformation under low temperature was studied in a laboratory incubation experiment. Results and discussion Warming and grazing treatments affected soil C and N pools differently, and these effects varied with soil depth. Warming significantly increased TN, MBC, MBN, and SON and decreased δ13C at the 10-20 and 20-30 cm soil depths, whilst grazing generally decreased SON at the 10-20 and 20-30 cm, and MBC at 20-30 cm. At the 0-10 cm depth, neither warming nor grazing alone affects these soil parameters significantly, indicating that there could be considerable perturbation on the soil surface. However, grazing alone increased NO3 --N, total inorganic N, SOC and δ15N at the 0-10 cm depth. Incubated at 4°C, warming (particularly with grazing) led to net immobilization of N, but no-warming treatments led to net N mineralization, whilst nitrification was strong across all these treatments. Correlations between MBC and SOC, and TN and MBN or SON were positive. However, SON was less well correlated with TN and MBN compared with the highly positive correlations between SOC and MBC. Conclusions It is clearly demonstrated that warming and grazing affected labile C and N pools significantly, but differently after 3 years' treatments Warming tended to enlarge labile C and N pools through increased litter inputs, whilst grazing tended to increase inorganic N pools, decrease SON and accelerate N cycling. Grazing might modify the mode that warming affected soil C and N pools through its strong impacts on microbial processes and N cycling. These results suggested that interactive effects of warming and grazing on C and N pools might have significant implications for the long-term C and N storage and productivity of alpine meadow ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Alpine meadow; Carbon cycling; Grazing; Nitrogen cycling; Warming","alpine environment; biomass; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); extraction method; global warming; grazing; meadow; microbial activity; net ecosystem production; oxidation; sheep; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; solubility; transformation; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Ovis aries",,,,,,"Aerts, R., The freezer defrosting: global warming and litter decomposition rates in cold biomes (2006) J Ecol, 94, pp. 713-724; Bardgett, R.D., Leemans, D.K., Cook, R., Hobbs, P.J., Seasonality of the soil biota of grazed and ungrazed hill grasslands (1997) Soil Biol Biochem, 29, pp. 1285-1294; Bardgett, R.D., Jones, A.C., Jones, D.L., Kemmitt, S.J., Cook, R., Hobbs, P.J., Soil microbial community patterns related to the history and intensity of grazing in sub-montane ecosystems (2001) Soil Biol Biochem, 33, pp. 1653-1664; Belay-Tedla, A., Zhou, X.H., Su, B., Wan, S.Q., Luo, Y.Q., Labile, recalcitrant, and microbial carbon and nitrogen pools of a tallgrass prairie soil in the us Great Plains subjected to experimental warming and clipping (2009) Soil Biol Biochem, 41, pp. 110-116; Berg, B., Berg, M.P., Bottner, P., Box, E., Breymeyer, A., Deanta, R.C., Couteaux, M., Desanto, A.V., Litter mass-loss rates in pine forests of Europe and eastern United-States-some relationships with climate and litter quality (1993) Biogeochem, 20, pp. 127-159; Blumfield, T.J., Xu, Z.H., Impact of harvest residues on soil mineral nitrogen dynamics in the first two years of hoop pine plantation in subtropical Australia (2003) For Ecol Manage, 179, pp. 55-67; Brookes, P.C., Landman, A., Pruden, G., Jenkinson, D.S., Chloroform fumigation and the release of soil nitrogen: a rapid direct extraction method to measure microbial biomass nitrogen in soil (1985) Soil Biol Biochem, 17, pp. 837-842; Burton, J., Chen, C.R., Xu, Z.H., Ghadiri, H., Gross nitrogen transformations in adjacent native and plantation forests of subtropical Australia (2007) Soil Biol Biochem, 39, pp. 426-433; Burton, J., Chen, C.R., Xu, Z.H., Ghadiri, H., Soil microbial biomass, activity and community composition in adjacent native and plantation forests of subtropical Australia (2010) J Soils Sediments, 10, pp. 1267-1277; Chapin, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Laundre, J.A., Responses of arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Chen, C.R., Xu, Z.H., Soil carbon and nitrogen pools and microbial properties in a 6-year old slash pine plantation of subtropical Australia: impacts of harvest residue management (2005) For Ecol Manage, 206, pp. 237-247; Chen, C.R., Xu, Z.H., On the nature and ecological functions of soil soluble organic nitrogen (SON) in forest ecosystems (2006) J Soils Sediments, 6, pp. 63-66; Chen, C.R., Xu, Z.H., Analysis and behavior of soluble organic nitrogen in forest soils (2008) J Soils Sediments, 8, pp. 363-378; Chen, C.R., Xu, Z.H., Hughes, J.M., Effects of nitrogen fertilization on soil nitrogen pools and microbial properties in a hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) plantation in southeast Queensland, Australia (2002) Biol Fertil Soils, 36, pp. 276-283; Chen, C.R., Xu, Z.H., Blumfield, T.J., Hughes, J.M., Soil microbial biomass during the early establishment of hoop pine plantation: seasonal variation and impacts of site preparation (2003) For Ecol Manage, 186, pp. 213-225; Dawson, T.E., Mambelli, S., Plamboeck, A.H., Templer, P.H., Tu, K.P., Stable isotopes in plant ecology (2002) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 33, pp. 507-559; Evans, R.D., Ehleringer, J.R., A break in the nitrogen cycle in aridlands?
