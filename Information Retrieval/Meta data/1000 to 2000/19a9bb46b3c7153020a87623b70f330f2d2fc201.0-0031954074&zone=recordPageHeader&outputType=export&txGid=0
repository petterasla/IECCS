These major climate variables directly influence water quality in lakes by altering changes in flow and water temperature balance. High concentration of nutrient enrichment and expected variability of climate can lead to periodic phytoplankton blooms and an alteration of the neutral trophic balance. As a result, dissolved oxygen levels, with low concentrations, can fluctuate widely and algal productivity may reach critical levels. In this work, we will present: 1) recent results of GCMs climate scenarios downscaling project that was held at the University of Derby, UK.; 2) current/future comparative results of a new mathematical lake eutrophication model (LEM) in which output of phytoplankton growth rate and dissolved oxygen will be presented for Suwa lake in Japan as a case study. The model parameters were calibrated for the period of 1973-1983 and validated for the period of 1983-1993. Meteorologic, hydrologic, and lake water quality data of 1990 were selected for the assessment analysis. Statistical relationships between seven daily meteorological time series and three airflow indices were used as a means for downscaling daily outputs of Hadley Centre Climate Model (HadCM2SUL) to the station sub-grid scale.","Climate change; Dissolved oxygen; Downscaling; Eutrophication; Mathematical model; Phytoplankton growth","Phytoplankton growth; Climate change; Dissolved oxygen sensors; Eutrophication; Growth kinetics; Lake pollution; Mathematical models; Water quality; dissolved oxygen; lake water; climate change; climatic change; dissolved oxygen; growth rate; lake; lake water quality; phytoplankton; water quality; air temperature; climate; conference paper; eutrophication; lake; mathematical model; phytoplankton; plant growth; solar radiation; velocity; water flow; water quality; water supply; water temperature; wind; algae",,,,,,"Di Toro, D.M., Fitzpatrik, Documentation for Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) (1983) EPA/600/3-81-044, , Env.
