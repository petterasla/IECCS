The model is run with and without changes in three-dimensional cloud fraction under 2 × CO2, radiative forcing. This model was chosen in part because of its relatively successful representation of modern Arctic cloud cover, a trait attributable to the parameterized treatment of mixed-phase microphysics. Simulated modern Arctic cloud fraction is insensitive to model biases in surface boundary conditions (SSTs and sea ice distribution), but the modeled Arctic climate is sensitive to high-frequency cloud variability. When forced with increased CO2, the model generally simulates more (less) vertically integrated cloudiness in high (low) latitudes. In the simulation without cloud feedbacks, cloud fraction is fixed at its modern control value at all grid points and all levels while CO2, is doubled. Compared with this fixed-cloud experiment, the simulated cloud changes enhance greenhouse warming at all latitudes, accounting for one-third of the global warming signal. This positive feedback is most pronounced in the Arctic, where approximately 40% of the warming is due to cloud changes. The strong cloud feedback in the Arctic is caused not only by local processes but also by cloud changes in lower latitudes, where positive top-of-the-atmosphere cloud radiative forcing anomalies are larger. The extra radiative energy gained in lower latitudes is transported dynamically to the Arctic via moist static energy flux convergence. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of remote impacts from low and midlatitudes for Arctic climate change. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Clouds; Computer simulation; Global warming; Mathematical models; Cloud feedbacks; Microphysics; Climatology; climate forcing; cloud; feedback mechanism; greenhouse gas; Arctic",,,,,,"(2000) Environmental Working Group Arctic Meteorology and Climate Atlas, , Arctic Climatology Project National Snow and Ice Data Center, CD-ROM; Beesley, J.A., Estimating the effect of clouds on the Arctic surface energy budget (2000) J.
