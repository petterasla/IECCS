However, few studies have examined the physiological mechanisms that theoretically underlie this differential success. Because correlative evidence suggests that invasiveness is related to the width of a species' latitudinal range, it has been assumed - but largely untested - that range width predicts breadth of habitat temperatures and physiological thermotolerances. In this study, we use empirical data from a marine community as a case study to address the hypotheses that (1) geographic temperature range attributes are related to temperature tolerance, leading to greater eurythermality in invasive species, and (2) stress protein expression is a subcellular mechanism that could contribute to differences in thermotolerance. We examined three native and six invasive species common in the subtidal epibenthic communities of California, USA. We assessed thermotolerance by exposing individuals to temperatures between 14°C and 31°C and determining the temperature lethal to 50% of individuals (LT50) after a 24 hour exposure. We found a strong positive relationship between the LT50 and both maximum habitat temperatures and the breadth of temperatures experience across the species' ranges. In addition, of the species in our study, invasives tended to inhabit broader habitat temperature ranges and higher maximum temperatures. Stress protein expression may contribute to these differences: the more thermotolerant, invasive species Diplosoma listerianum expressed higher levels of a 70-kDa heat-shock protein than the less thermotolerant, native Distaplia occidentalis for which levels declined sharply above the LT50. Our data highlight differences between native and invasive species with respect to organismal and cellular temperature tolerances. Future studies should address, across a broader phylogenetic and ecosystem scope, whether this physiological mechanism has facilitated the current success of invasive species and could lead to greater success of invasives than native species as global warming continues. © 2011 Zerebecki, Sorte.",,"heat shock protein 70; heat shock protein; article; benthos; controlled study; Diplosoma listerianum; Distaplia occidentalis; ecosystem; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; epibenthic community; greenhouse effect; heat tolerance; invasive species; lethality; marine environment; native species; nonhuman; phylogeny; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; species habitat; survival; United States; Urochordata; adaptation; animal; biological model; geography; introduced species; metabolism; physiology; temperature; Urochordata; Diplosoma listerianum; Distaplia occidentalis; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Geography; Heat-Shock Proteins; Introduced Species; Models, Biological; Temperature; Urochordata",,"Heat-Shock Proteins",,,,"Vitousek, P.M., Mooney, H.A., Lubchenco, J., Mellilo, J.M., Human domination of Earth's ecosystems (1997) Science, 277, pp. 494-499; Sala, O.E., Chapin III, F.S., Armesto, J.J., Berlow, E., Bloomfield, J., Global biodiversity scenarios for the year 2100 (2000) Science, 287, pp. 1770-1774; Halpern, B.S., Walbridge, S., Selkoe, K.A., Kappel, C.V., Micheli, F., A global map of human impact on marine ecosystems (2008) Science, 319, pp. 948-952; Ruiz, G.M., Fofonoff, P., Hines, A.H., Grosholz, E.D., Non-indigenous species as stressors in estuarine and marine communities: Assessing invasion impacts and interactions (1999) Limnol Oceanogr, 44, pp. 950-972; Carlton, J.T., Global change and biological invasions (2000) Invasive Species in a Changing World, pp. 31-54. , In: Mooney JT, Hobbs RJ, editors, Washington, Island Press; Grosholz, E., Ecological and evolutionary consequences of coastal invasions (2002) Trends Ecol Evol, 17, pp. 22-27; Walther, G.R., Post, E., Convey, P., Menzel, A., Parmesan, C., Ecological response to recent climate change (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 389-395; Parmesan, C., Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change (2006) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 37, pp. 637-669; Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis (2007), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge, Cambridge University PressHellman, J.J., Byers, J.E., Bierwagen, B.G., Dukes, J.S., Five potential consequences of climate change for invasive species (2008) Conserv Biol, 22, pp. 534-543; Dijkstra, J.A., Harris, L.G., Maintenance of diversity altered by a shift in dominant species: implications for species coexistence (2009) Mar Ecol Progr Ser, 387, pp. 71-80; Dukes, J.S., Mooney, H.A., Does global change increase the success of biological invaders?
