The greenhouse warming potential (GWP) of this gas is much higher than carbon dioxide. Therefore, any reduction in methane emissions is really important in atmosphere reconstruction. Nitrogen is needed to be removed from landfill gas to obtain low grade natural gas as a renewable source of energy from garbage, but the separation is really difficult. Adsorption was considered as a possibility for this separation, and silicalite was studied as the adsorbent. The adsorption behavior of methane and nitrogen with this adsorbent was studied by concentration pulse chromatography and constant volume techniques. Ideal separation factors were obtained from the experimental pure adsorption isotherms by using the temperature independent Toth isotherm model. Mixture adsorption isotherms for the binary system of methane and nitrogen at (40,70, and 100)°C at 1 bar total pressure were determined experimentally. Corresponding x-y diagrams and separation factors were obtained from these data. The thermodynamic consistency tests between pure and binary gas adsorption systems were also carried out. The separation factors obtained with silicalite for the separation applications of methane and nitrogen gases in this work are much better than those obtained for other systems in the literature. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Adsorption isotherms; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Chromatographic analysis; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Isotherms; Leakage (fluid); Methane; Nitrogen; Nonmetals; Renewable energy resources; Separation; Zeolites; Adsorption behaviors; Binary adsorptions; Binary gas adsorptions; Binary systems; Concentration pulse; Constant volume techniques; Ghg emissions; Green house gas; Greenhouse warming; Ideal separations; Landfill gas; Low grades; Methane emissions; Nitrogen gas; Renewable sources; Separation factors; Silicalite; Thermodynamic consistencies; Total pressures; Toth isotherms; Gas adsorption",,,,,,"Cavenati, S., Grande, C.A., Rodrigues, A.E., Adsorption Equilibrium of Methane, Carbon Dioxide, and Nitrogen on Zeolite 13X at High Pressures (2004) J.
