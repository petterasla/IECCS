The investigation indicates that there are very distinct seasonal differences in patterns of temperature variation as a function of latitude and altitude: a very significant latitude effect in winter and a very significant altitude effect in summer. However, with global warming, the latitude effect in winter is weakening and the altitude effect in summer is strengthening. This pattern of change in the relationship between temperature and latitude & altitude is helpful in efforts to reconstruct and explain the past temperature patterns and variations. © Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2009.","Altitude effect; China; Global warming; Latitude effect",,,,,,,"Cubasch, U., Projections of future climate change (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, pp. 525-582. , In Kim JW & Stone J Cambridge University Press; Dixon Keith, W., Delworth Thomas, L., Knutson Thomas, R., A Comparison of Climate Change Simulations Produced by two GFDL Coupled Climate Models (2003) Global and Planetary Change, 37, pp. 81-102; He, Y., Lu, A., Zhang, Z., Pang, H., Gu, J., Seasonal Variation of Regional Warming-up Structure across China in the Past Half Century (2005) Climate Research, 28, pp. 213-219; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) In: Albritton DL, and Meira Filho LG, The IPCC Third Assessment Report, Working Group I Report, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Jones, P.D., Moberg, A., Hemispheric and Large-scale Surface Air Temperature Variations: An Extensive Revision and an Update to 2001 (2003) Journal of Climate, 16, pp. 206-223; Lu, A., Pang, D., He, Y., Pang, H., Wang, T., Ge, J., Regional Summer Temperature Decrease against Global Warming in China, Landform Effect?
