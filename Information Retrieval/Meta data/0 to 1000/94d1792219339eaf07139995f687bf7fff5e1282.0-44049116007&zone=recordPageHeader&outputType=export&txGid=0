This paper gives a preliminary assessment of the process which indicates that substantially more fuel energy could be produced--and at lower cost--than other current options for mitigating CO2 from mobile sources. The incremental cost of eliminating net CO2 emissions is estimated at $0.05 per gallon (3.78 liters) of gasoline displaced by methanol. About 80 percent reduction should be achievable at no incremental cost. © 1992.","alternative fuel; biomass; Carbon dioxide; global warming; methanol; transportation",,,,,,,"Baron, Porter, Hammond, (1975) Chemical Equilibrium in Carbon-Hydrogen-Oxygen Systems, , M.I.T.
