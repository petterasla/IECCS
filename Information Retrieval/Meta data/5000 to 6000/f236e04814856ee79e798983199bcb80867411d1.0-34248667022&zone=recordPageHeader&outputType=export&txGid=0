This paper studies how to assess the grain yield impact of climate change, according to the climate change over a long time period in the future as predicted by a climate system model. The application of the concept of a traditional ""yield impact of meteorological factor (YIMF)"" or ""yield impact of weather factor"" to the grain yield assessment of a decadal or even a longer timescale would be suffocated at the outset because the YIMF is for studying the phenomenon on an interannual timescale, and it is difficult to distinguish between the trend caused by climate change and the one resulting from changes in non-climatic factors. Therefore, the concept of the yield impact of climatic change (YICC), which is defined as the difference in the per unit area yields (PUAY) of a grain crop under a changing and an envisaged invariant climate conditions, is presented in this paper to assess the impact of global climate change on grain yields. The climatic factor has been introduced into the renowned economic Cobb-Douglas model, yielding a quantitative assessment method of YICC using real data. The method has been tested using the historical data of Northeast China, and the results show that it has an encouraging application outlook.","Climate; Global change; Production function; Yield impact of meteorological factor",,,,,,,"Jieming, C., Guolin, F., Wenjie, D., Duzheng, Y., Huizhi, C., A new approach on the economy evolution of influence on China agriculture by climate change (2004) Climatic and Environmental Research, 9 (2), pp. 361-368. , in Chinese; Jieming, C., Wenjie, D., Duzheng, Y., Construction of a novel economy-climate model (1735) Chinese Science Bulletin, 51 (14). , in Chinese 2006; Curry, R.D., Dynamic simulation of plant growth, I.
