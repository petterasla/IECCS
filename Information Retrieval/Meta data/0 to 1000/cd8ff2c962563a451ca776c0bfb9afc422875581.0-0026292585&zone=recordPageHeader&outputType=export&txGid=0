Sea-level measurements around South Africa are available only from 1959 onwards and their analyses show trends comparable with global trends of sea-level rise. The best long tide gauge record is from Port Nolloth and shows a rise in relative sea level over the period 1960 to 1988 of 12.3 mm/decade. Sea level in South Africa is expected to rise by approximately 20 cm within the next 40 years and may increase further to up to 100 cm by the end of the next century. -from Authors",,"global trend; greenhouse gas; sea level rise; tide gauge record; South Africa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00382353,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026292585
