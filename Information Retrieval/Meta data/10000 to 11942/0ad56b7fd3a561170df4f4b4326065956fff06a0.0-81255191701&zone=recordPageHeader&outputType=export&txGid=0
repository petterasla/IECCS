Bioethanol can be used as a substitute for fossil-based fuel and to produce commodity chemicals, in which the latter has larger benefit returns and wider application. Therefore, switching the use of bioethanol as a feedstock of chemical processes from the conventional fossil-based one to produce large quantities of chemicals has recently received increasing attention. In this study, we investigate the potential of substituting bioethanol-based processes for fossil-based processes to produce ethyl acetate, by considering economic and environmental issues. Different technologies of producing ethyl acetate are considered. One representative fossil-based process is modeled and compared with three bioethanol-based processes, with respect to production cost and CO 2 emission indicators. The results show that bioethanol-based processes have better cost saving and less global warming potential. The identification of a feasible bioethanol-based production process of ethyl acetate will largely contribute to the development of the chemical industry and help ensure the actual sustainability of such an emerging technology. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","bioethanol-based processes; CO 2 emission; production cost","bioethanol-based processes; Chemical process; Commodity chemicals; Cost saving; Emerging technologies; Environmental assessment; Environmental issues; Ethyl acetates; Global warming potential; Key technologies; production cost; Production process; Techno-economics; Carbon dioxide; Chemical engineering; Chemical industry; Economic analysis; Ethanol; Global warming; Indicators (chemical); Sustainable development; Volatile fatty acids; Bioethanol",,,,,,"Lynd, L.R., Wyman, C.E., Gerngross, T.U., Biocommodity engineering (1999) Biotechnology Progress, 15 (5), pp. 777-793. , DOI 10.1021/bp990109e; Nguyen, T.H.T., Sugiyama, H., Noda, M., Hirao, M., Structural framework supporting selection of extraction processes under sustainable criteria (2010) Journal of Chemical Engineering of Japan, 43, pp. 186-195; Sugiyama, H., Fischer, U., Hungerbuhler, K., Hirao, M., Decision framework for chemical process design including different stages of environmental, health, and safety assessment (2008) AIChE Journal, 54 (4), pp. 1037-1053. , DOI 10.1002/aic.11430; Curran, M.A., Do bio-based products move us toward sustainability?
