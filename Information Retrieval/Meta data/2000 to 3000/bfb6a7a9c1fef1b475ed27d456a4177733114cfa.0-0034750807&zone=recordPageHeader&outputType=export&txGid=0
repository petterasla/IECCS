In this paper, the inter-relation between afforestation, global warming and acid rain has been analyzed. Numerical simulations indicate that afforestation of deserts has distinct advantage as carbon sink and as an important factor for changing microclimate of the region rather than a source of energy. Acidic deposition may well be utilised as fertiliser in nutrient deficit soil of tropical arid areas. However, past trends and projections of acidic deposition in arid areas adjacent to Thar deserts indicate an early efforts are required to cap the opportunity. Delays may contribute towards more incidences of failures.","Acidification; Afforestation; Carbon stock; Deserts","Acid rain; Carbon; Computer simulation; Fertilizers; Global warming; Acidic deposition; Forestry; carbon; fertilizer; acid deposition; acid rain; afforestation; carbon sink; desert; global warming; acid rain; acidification; article; controlled study; desert; energy resource; forest; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; incidence; microclimate; simulation; soil; tropics; Forestation; India; Pakistan",,,,,,"Foell, W., Amann, M., Carmichael, G., Chaduich, M., Hettelingh, J., Hordjick, L., Dianwa, Z., (1995), Report on the World Bank Project, Acid Rain and Emission Reduction in AsiaGeyer, R.A., (1992), A Global Warming Forum: Scientific, Economic and Legal Overview, CRC Press, Inc., Florida, USAKojima, T., The Carbon Dioxide Problem (1998) Current Science, 75 (6), p. 579. , Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Japan.
