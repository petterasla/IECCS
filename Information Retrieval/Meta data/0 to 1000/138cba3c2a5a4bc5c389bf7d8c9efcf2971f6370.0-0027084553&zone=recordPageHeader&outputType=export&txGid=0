It is shown that many of the basic economic tools and techniques needed to address global climate change issues are already found in the existing environmental and natural resource economics literature. However, in the application of economic concepts to climate change problems, much work remains. It is suggested that priority areas for future economic research include analysis of the impacts and the adaptation of economic systems, the value of information and decision making under uncertainty, and the development of world models of the economy that aid in understanding and predicting the sources and effects of global change that are linked to economic activity. © 1992.",,"climatic change; economic issue; man-environment relations",,,,,,"US Council on Environmental Quality, (1986) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, , Executive Office of the President, Washington, DC; US Environmental Protection Agency, Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate, Report to Congress (1990) Executive Summary, , 21P-2003.2; Oates, The regulation of externalities: efficient behavior by sources and victims (1983) Public Finance, 3, pp. 362-375; National Climate Program Office, Climate impact response functions (1989) Workshop report, Coolfont, WV; Butler, Maher, The control of externalities Abatement vs damage prevention (1986) Southern Economic Journal, 52, pp. 1088-1102. , See; World Bank, Trade and pricing policies in world agriculture (1986) World Development Report 1986, , see, Oxford University Press, Oxford, It is important to point out that existing public policies unrelated to global climate change may also distort individual and firm adaptive decisions, particularly in economic sectors such as agriculture where public policies typically play a critical role; D'Arge, Schulze, Brookshire, Carbon dioxide and intergenerational choice (1982) American Economic Review, pp. 251-256. , See; Brown, Policy analysis welfare economics and the greenhouse effect (1988) Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 7, pp. 471-475; Cropper, Oates, Environmental economics: A survey (1990) Discussion Paper QE90-12-REV, , For a survey of the literature, see, Resources for the Future, Washington, DC; US Department of Energy, The economics of long-term global climate change: A preliminary assessment (1990) Report of an Interagency Task Force, DOE/PE-0096P; US Department of Energy, The economics of long-term global climate change: A preliminary assessment (1990) Report of an Interagency Task Force, DOE/PE-0096P, p. vii; US Department of Justice, A Comprehensive Approach to Addressing Potential Climate Change (1991) Report of the Interagency Task Force, , Washington, DC; Reilly, Climate-change damage and the trace-gas-index issue (1992) Economic Issues in Global Climate Change: Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources, pp. 72-88. , J.
