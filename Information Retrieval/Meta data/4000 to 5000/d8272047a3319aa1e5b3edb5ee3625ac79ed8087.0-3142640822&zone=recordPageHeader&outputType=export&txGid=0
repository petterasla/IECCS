Gubkina 8, Moscow 117930, Russian Federation","The global-warming parameter and change in the surface heat balance were studied on the basis of 18 combined atmosphere-ocean general circulation models participating in the CMIP international program. In models with a global-warming parameter higher (smaller) than the value averaged over all the models (1.69 K), global warming is generally accompanied by an increase (decrease) in the surface shortwave radiative balance. For increased carbon dioxide, the dependence of the global-warming parameter on the geographical distribution of incoming shortwave radiation and heat flux correction in modeling the present-day climate is discussed. Based on this dependence, the expected value of the global-warming parameter at increased carbon dioxide is estimated for the actual climate system. © 2004 by MAIK ""Nauka/Interperiodica"" (Russia).",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; carbon dioxide enrichment; general circulation model; global warming; heat balance",,,,,,"Meehl, G.A., Boer, G.J., Covey, C., The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) (2000) Bull.
