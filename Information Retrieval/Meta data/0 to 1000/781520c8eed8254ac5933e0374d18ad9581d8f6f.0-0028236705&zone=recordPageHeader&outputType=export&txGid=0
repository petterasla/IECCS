It is argued that there is no demonstrable evidence that lead's use as a gasoline additive results in any adverse health effects. Potential environmental hazards exist with low-lead and unleaded gasolines. Furthermore, missions of carbon dioxide, the 'greenhouse' gas implicated in global warming, increase when gasoline lead levels are restricted and cars are fitted with three-way catalysts. © 1994.","Adverse health effects; Environmental hazards; Gasoline octane quality; Lead; Low- and unleaded gasoline","lead; air pollution; air quality control; conference paper; environmental protection; priority journal; traffic; united kingdom",,"lead, 7439-92-1",,,,"Commission of the European Communities, (1984) ERGA2-Air Pollution Summary Report DGX1/98/84-EN, 3 V. , Brussels; CONCAWE, The Oil Companies European Organisation for Environmental and Health Protection, Assessment of the Energy Balances and Economic Consequences of the Reduction and Elimination of Lead in Gasoline (1983) Report No. 11/83, , The Hague; Official Journal of the European Communities, (1985) Council Directive 85/210/EEC.
