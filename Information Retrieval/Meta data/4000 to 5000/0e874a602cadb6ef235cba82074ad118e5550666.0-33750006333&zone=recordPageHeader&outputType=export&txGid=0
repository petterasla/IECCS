After correction for changes in tidal amplitude, the sea-level change envelope reconstructed from five AMS radiocarbon dates of basal marsh sediments at Romney Marsh in Revere, Massachusetts, indicates a rise in mean sea level (MSL) of close to 2.6 m in the past 3300 years. The data indicate a possible decrease in the average rate of rise from 0.80 ± 0.25 mm/y between 3300 to 1000 YBP to a rate of 0.52 ± 0.62 mm/y between 1000 YBP and the past 150 to 500 years. An increase in the rate of sea-level rise is evident over the past few hundred years. A slowing of the rate of sea-level rise between 1000 YBP and historic times and the increase in the rate of rise to modern values is also evident in other sea-level records from Maine and Connecticut. The coherence between these sea-level records and concomitant climate changes in and around the North Atlantic indicates that regional-scale sea-level fluctuations in the region may be driven by climate forcing. However, earlier sea-level fluctuations correlated to sea-surface temperature variability are not well-resolved by this record or other records in the region and may indicate that changes in sea level are not tightly coupled with sea-surface temperature changes.","Climate; Global warming; Halophytes; Salt marsh; Sea-surface temperatures; Subsidence","accelerator mass spectrometry; climate forcing; Holocene; paleoenvironment; radiocarbon dating; saltmarsh; sea level change; sea surface temperature; Connecticut; Maine; Massachusetts; North America; Romney Marsh [Massachusetts]; United States",,,,,,"Belknap, D.F., Andersen, B.G., Andersen, R.S., Andersen, W.A., Borns Jr., H.W., Jacobsen, G.W., Kelley, J.T., Tyler, D.A., Late Quaternary sea-level changes in Maine (1987) Sea Level Fluctuations and Coastal Evolution, 41, pp. 71-85. , Numedal, D., Pilkey, O.H., Jr., and Howard, J.D.
