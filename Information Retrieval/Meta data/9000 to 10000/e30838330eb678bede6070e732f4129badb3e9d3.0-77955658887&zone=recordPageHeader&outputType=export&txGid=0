In this study, a multi-objective optimization model is developed to analyze the optimal operating strategy of a DER system while combining the minimization of energy cost with the minimization of environmental impact which is assessed in terms of CO2 emissions. The trade-off curve is obtained by using the compromise programming method. As an illustrative example, the DER system installed in an eco-campus in Japan has been selected for case study. The distributed technologies under consideration include photovoltaics (PV), fuel cell and gas engine for providing electrical and thermal demands. The obtained results demonstrate that increasing the satisfaction degree of economic objective leads to increased CO2 emissions. The operation of the DER system is more sensitive when environmental objective is paid more attention. Moreover, according to the sensitivity analysis, the consideration of electricity buy-back, carbon tax, as well as fuel switching to biogas, has more or less effect on the operation of DER systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed energy system; Economic objective; Environmental objective; Multi-objective optimization; Operation; Sensitivity analysis","Carbon taxes; Compromise programming; Distributed energy resource; Distributed energy systems; Energy cost; Environmental aspects; Environmental constraints; Environmental objectives; Fuel switching; Illustrative examples; Multi-objective optimization models; Operating strategy; Operation; Photovoltaics; Satisfaction degrees; Thermal demands; Trade-off curves; Biogas; Costs; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Fuel cells; Gas engines; Global warming; Natural gas transportation; Sensitivity analysis; Multiobjective optimization; carbon dioxide; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; emission control; energy market; energy resource; environmental economics; environmental impact; global warming; installation; multiobjective programming; numerical model; optimization; photovoltaic system; pollution tax; sensitivity analysis; trade-off; Japan",,,,,,"Alanne, K., Saari, A., Distributed energy generation and sustainable development (2006) Renew Sust Energy Rev, 10 (6), pp. 539-558; Allen, S.R., Hammond, G.P., McManus, M.C., Prospects for and barriers to domestic micro-generation: a United Kingdom perspective (2008) Appl Energy, 85 (6), pp. 528-544; Ren, H., Gao, W., A MILP model for integrated plan and evaluation of distributed energy systems (2010) Appl Energy, 87 (3), pp. 1001-1014; (2006), Ruan Y.
