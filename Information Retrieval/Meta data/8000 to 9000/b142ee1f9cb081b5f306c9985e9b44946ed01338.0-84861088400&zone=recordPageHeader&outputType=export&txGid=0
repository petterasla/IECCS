We also investigate the variation in cell performance with respect to the number and position of the GBs within the device to obtain a better understanding of performance variations. The optimized cell also demonstrates the possibility of having thin film transistors (TFTs) and solar cells on the same substrate, leading to new applications such as self-powered, low-cost, wireless sensor nodes. © 2011 IEEE.",,"2D modeling; Cell efficiency; Cell performance; Doping profiles; Excimer laser annealed; Excimer laser annealing; New applications; Optimization method; Performance variations; Self-powered; Solar cell structures; Thin-film transistor (TFTs); Trap density; Wireless sensor node; Electric network synthesis; Excimer lasers; Grain boundaries; Optimization; Photovoltaic effects; Polysilicon; Thin films; Thin film transistors",,,,,,"Card, H.C., Yang, E.S., Electronic Processes at Grain Boundaries in Polycrystalline Semiconductors under Optical Illumination (1977) IEEE Trans.
