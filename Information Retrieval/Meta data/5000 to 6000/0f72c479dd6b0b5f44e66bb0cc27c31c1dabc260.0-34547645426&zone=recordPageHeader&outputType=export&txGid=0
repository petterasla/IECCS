In the process of the assessment, not only the environmental burdens originated from ELV dismantling processes and recycling processes but also the environment benefits obtained from the avoided effects of recycled materials on the environmental impacts associated with virgin materials are considered. The significant issues which are defined as the environmental aspects that contribute more than 1 % to the total environmental impacts in each impact category are identified from the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). From the Life Cycle Inventory Analysis (LCI) and LCIA studies, it is shown that the significant environmental aspects are associated with recycling processes of ferrous metals, shredding processes of compressed car bodies and recycling processes of end-of-life engines. In particular, the recycling processes of ferrous metals appear to have the most significant environmental impacts in the ELV treatment system. Thus, it is required to improve the recycling processes of ferrous metals in order to make the current ELV treatment system more environmentally sound. This study also deals with ELV treatment scenarios as follows; reference is the current ELV treatment system with 78 % of recycling rate, Scenario I takes into account of both the recycling of the additional automotive parts (85 % recycling rate) and the collection of refrigerants, and Scenario II assumes energy recovery as well as 95 % of recycling rate. It is found that scenario II has better ecological profiles than the others in the environmental impact categories such as Abiotic Resource Depletion (ARD), Global Warming (GW), Ozone Depletion (OD), Photochemical Oxidant Creation (POC), Eutrophication (EU) and Human Toxicity (HT).","ELV treatment system; LCA; LCI analysis; LCIA; Recycle",,,,,,,"EU, Directive 2000/53EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2000), 9.18Yi, H.C., Techniques for recovery and treatment of ELV, 19 (6), pp. 34-44. , The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers; Hyundai-motor, The Road to Sustainability, pp. 44-45, 2002/2003Environmental management - Life cycle assessment - Principles and framework (1997), ISO 14040Http://www.hyundai-motor.com/index.htmlEnvironmental management standardization project for constructing environmentally-friendly industrial structure, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy 2003Environmental management - Life cycle assessment - Goal and scope definition and inventory analysis (1998), ISO 14041Environmental management - Life cycle assessment - Life cycle impact assessment (2000), ISO 14042(1999) Solidification, Dry Distillation and Gasification Technology, , Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Research and Development on Automobile Shredder Residue Compactions, December; Funazaki Atsushi and Taneda Katsunori: Life Cycle Assessment on Automobile Shredder Residue Treatments of a 2002-year End-of-Life Vehicle","Tak, H.; Department of Materials Chemistry and Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-701, South Korea; email: takhur@konkuk.ac.kr",,,,,,,,1226086X,,,,"English","J.
