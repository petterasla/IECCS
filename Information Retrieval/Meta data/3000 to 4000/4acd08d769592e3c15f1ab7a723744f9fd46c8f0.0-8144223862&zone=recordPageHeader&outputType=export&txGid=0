Researchers and managers must become more aware of positive feedback, including the self-reinforcing ecological, technological, economic, cultural and conceptual processes that accelerate the degradation of coral reefs. Much of the research on coral reef damage has focused on its proximal causes (e.g., global warming, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, overfishing, pollution, sedimentation, and disease) rather than its ultimate causes, the increasing human population and associated economic demands. To stop the deterioration of coral reef ecosystems, management must be proactive, terminating the self-reinforcing processes of coral reef degradation rather than perpetually restoring reefs or resource stocks. This can be accomplished only by clarifying the entire economic picture to instill more responsible behavior in the public.","Coral reefs; Economics; Positive feedback; Responsibility; Symptoms","Anthozoa",,,,,,"Abbott, I.A., (1984) Limu: An Ethnobotanical Study of Some Hawaiian Seaweeds. 3rd Ed., , Lawai (HI): Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden; Brower, K.D., (1983) A Song for Satawal, , London: Arena; Buddemeier, R.W., Ware, J.R., Coral reef decline in the Caribbean (2003) Science, 302, pp. 391-393; Butler, J.N., Burnett-Herkes, J., Barnes, J.A., Ward, J., The Bermuda fisheries: A tragedy of the commons averted?
