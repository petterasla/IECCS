The irregular behaviour is due to the slow equilibration time of the distribution of basal till, which lubricates ice-sheet motion. This nonlinear response means that predictions of future collapse of the ice sheet in response to global warming must take into account its past history, and in particular whether the present basal till distribution predisposes the ice sheet towards rapid change.",,"basalt till; ice sheet collapse; model simulation; nonlinear response; oscillations; Antarctica, (West)",,,,,,,"MacAyeal, D.R.; Department of Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago, 5734 South Ellis Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637, United States",,,,,,,,00280836,,NATUA,,"English","Nature",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027040383
