With a boiling point of 128°C, this fluid is well suited for use in ion implanters, steppers, etchers, plasma-aided tools, and automated testers. Its heat transfer performance is shown to be superior to that of perfluorinated fluids of similar boiling point. Electrical properties permit its use in all but the most demanding dielectric applications. Material compatibility should permit 'drop-in' substitution in well-designed PFC systems.",,"Boiling liquids; Dielectric devices; Electric conductivity; Electric properties; Heat transfer; Molecules; Nusselt number; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor materials; Specific heat; Thermodynamic stability; Viscosity; Heat transfer liquids; Hydrofluoroethers; Perfluorocarbon; Hydrocarbons",,,,,,"PFC fluids are generally composed of a carbon backbone on which all available bonding sites are occupied by fluorine atoms. The backbone may be a simple carbon chain (i.e., C6F14), a carbon chain with one or more ether oxygen linkages (i.e. C3F7OC3F7) or an amine (i.e., N(C2F5)3)C4F9OCH3, sold commercially as 3M Novec Engineered Fluid HFE-7100, is an example of a hydrofluoroether with one oxygen or ""ether"" linkageBivens, D.B., Minor, B.H., Fluoroethers and other Next-Generation Fluids (1997) ASHRAE/NIST Refrigerants Conference, pp. 122-134. , October; (1999) Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 1998, Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project - Report No. 44, , WMO, Geneva; Gnielinski, V., New Equations for Heat and Mass Transfer in Turbulent Pipe and Channel Flow (1976) Int.
