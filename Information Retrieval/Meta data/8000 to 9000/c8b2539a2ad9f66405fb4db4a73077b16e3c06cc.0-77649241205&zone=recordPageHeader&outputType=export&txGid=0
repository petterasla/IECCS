The organization of the chart reflects the history of atmospheric chemistry, in which investigators typically focused on a single species of interest. However, changes in pollutant emissions and concentrations are a symptom, not a cause, of the primary driver of anthropogenic climate change: human activity. In this paper, we suggest organizing the bar chart according to drivers of change - that is, by economic sector. Climate impacts of tropospheric ozone, fine aerosols, aerosol-cloud interactions, methane, and long-lived greenhouse gases are considered. We quantify the future evolution of the total radiative forcing due to perpetual constant year 2000 emissions by sector, most relevant for the development of climate policy now, and focus on two specific time points, near-term at 2020 and long-term at 2100. Because sector profiles differ greatly, this approach fosters the development of smart climate policy and is useful to identify effective opportunities for rapid mitigation of anthropogenic radiative forcing.","Aerosols; Air pollution; Global warming; Mitigation; Ozone","methane; ozone; aerosol; air pollution; article; climate change; driver; economic aspect; evolution; field emission; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; molecular interaction; nonhuman; policy; priority journal; radiation; troposphere; Atmosphere; Climate Change; Environment; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industry; Policy Making",,"methane, 74-82-8; ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Levy H, II, Shindell DT, Gilliland A, Schwarzkopf MD, Horowitz LW (2008) Climate Projections Based on Emissions Scenarios for Long-Lived and Short-Lived Radiatively Active Gases and Aerosols. pp 1-120 U.S. Climate Change Science Program Synthesis and Assessment Product 3.2.
