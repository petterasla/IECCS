Their mycelial networks play an important role in nutrient mineralisation and distribution, but are also nutritious resources for various soil invertebrates. Global climate change is predicted to alter the diversity and community composition of these soil fauna. To understand whether changes in invertebrate species diversity are likely to affect fungal-mediated decomposition, this study compared the grazing potentials of different invertebrate taxa and functional groups. Specifically, the grazing impacts of seven invertebrate taxa on the growth and spatial distribution of six basidiomycete fungi growing from beech wood blocks in soil microcosms were explored. Wood decay rates by fungi were also compared. The consequences of grazing were both taxon- and species-specific. Generally, macro-invertebrates caused the greatest damage, while meso- and micro-invertebrates often stimulated mycelial growth. Invertebrate size, preferences and population dynamics are likely to influence grazing potentials. Effects of grazing varied between fungi, with mycelial morphology and biochemistry possibly influencing susceptibility. Heavy grazing indirectly increased fungal-mediated wood decomposition. Changes in invertebrate community composition are predicted to have consequences for fungal growth, activity and community structure in woodland soils. Abiotic climate change factors including CO 2 and temperature affect mycelial productivity directly, but the indirect effects, mediated through changes in the soil invertebrate community, may be equally important in controlling ecosystem functioning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Decomposer fungi; Grazing; Microbial community; Nutrient distribution; Soil invertebrates","biochemistry; carbon dioxide; climate change; community structure; decomposition; ecosystem function; forest soil; functional group; fungus; grazing; growth rate; macroinvertebrate; microbial activity; microbial community; microcosm; mineralization; morphology; population dynamics; soil fauna; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; spatial distribution; species diversity; woodland; woody debris; animal; annelid worm; arthropod; article; Basidiomycetes; beech; chemistry; cytology; feeding behavior; growth, development and aging; invertebrate; microbiology; nematode; physiology; population dynamics; soil; species difference; United Kingdom; wood; Animals; Arthropods; Basidiomycota; Fagus; Feeding Behavior; Invertebrates; Oligochaeta; Population Dynamics; Rhabditida; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Species Specificity; Wales; Wood; Basidiomycota; Fagus; Fungi; Invertebrata",,"Soil",,,,"A'Bear, A.D., Boddy, L., Raspotnig, G., Jones, T.H., Non-trophic effects of oribatid mites on cord-forming basidiomycetes in soil microcosms (2010) Ecol Entomol, 35, pp. 477-484; Baldrian, P., Valãåkovã, V., Degradation of cellulose by basidiomycetous fungi (2008) FEMS Microbiol Rev, 32, pp. 501-521; Bardgett, R.D., (2005) The Biology of Soil, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bardgett, R.D., Chan, K.F., Experimental evidence that soil fauna enhance nutrient mineralization and plant nutrient in montane grassland ecosystems (1999) Soil Biol Biochem, 31, pp. 23-33; Berg, M.P., Stoffer, M., van der Heuvel, H.H., Feeding guilds in Collembola based on digestive enzymes (2004) Pedobiologia, 48, pp. 589-601; Boddy, L., Donnelly, D.P., Fractal geometry and microorganisms in the environment (2008) Biophysical Chemistry of Fractal Structures and Processes in Environmental Systems, pp. 239-272. , N.
