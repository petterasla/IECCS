At three of these sites, new populations were established that persisted for four generations and expanded slowly in area. At seven sites, a small initial population eventually died out. At the 24 other sites, new populations did not become established, indicating that the sites were in some way unsuitable, that not enough seeds arrived, or that conditions suitable for seed germination do not occur every year. Thus, some species may be unable to disperse naturally out of their existing ranges in response to global climate change, particularly if habitat fragmentation creates barriers to dispersal. These species may have to be assisted to reach suitable site nearby to prevent extinction. -from Authors",,"dispersal; population viability; Abutilon theophrasti; Hypericum gentianoides; Impatiens capensis; Plantago aristata",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08888892,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027028090
