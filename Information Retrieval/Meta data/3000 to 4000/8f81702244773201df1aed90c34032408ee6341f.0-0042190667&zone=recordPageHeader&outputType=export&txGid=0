In this report we analyze temporal trends in malaria in Britain between 1840 and 1910, to assess the potential for reemergence of the disease. Our results demonstrate that at least 20% of the drop-off in malaria was due to increasing cattle population and decreasing acreages of marsh wetlands. Although both rainfall and average temperature were associated with year-to-year variability in death rates, there was no evidence for any association with the long-term malaria trend. Model simulations for future scenarios in Britain suggest that the change in temperature projected to occur by 2050 is likely to cause a proportional increase in local malaria transmission of 8-14%. The current risk is negligible, as >52,000 imported cases since 1953 have not led to any secondary cases. The projected increase in proportional risk is clearly insufficient to lead to the reestablishment of endemicity.",,"rain; article; cattle; disease transmission; endemic disease; Europe; greenhouse effect; human; infection risk; malaria; marsh; mortality; priority journal; United Kingdom; United States; wetland; Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Climate; Great Britain; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Logistic Models; Malaria; Models, Biological; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Bos taurus; Protozoa",,,,,,"(2002) Getting Ahead of the Curve: A Strategy for Combating Infectious Diseases (Including other Aspects of Health Protection), , Dept. of Health, London; Rogers, D.J., Randolph, S.E., Lindsay, S.W., Thomas, C.J., (2001) Health Effects of Climate Change in the UK, pp. 101-138. , ed.
