Similarly to gasification in industrial reactors, underground coal gasification(UCG) produces syngas, which can be used for power generation or for the production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels and other valuable chemical products. As compared with conventional mining and surface gasification, UCG promises lower capital/operating costs and also has other advantages, such as no human labor underground. In addition, UCG has the potential to be linked with carbon capture and sequestration. The increasing demand for energy, depletion of oil and gas resources, and threat of global climate change lead to growing interest in UCG throughout the world. In this article, we review the current status of this technology, focusing on recent developments in various countries. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon capture and sequestrations; Chemical products; Current status; Global climate changes; Human labor; Industrial reactors; Liquid hydrocarbon fuel; Oil and gas; Syn-gas; Underground coal gasification; Carbonization; Climate change; Coal; Coal gasification; Coal industry; Energy resources; Gas producers; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum deposits; Gas generators",,,,,,"Burton, E., Friedmann, J., Upadhye, R., (2006) Best Practices in Underground Coal Gasification; Contract W-7405-Eng-48; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory: Livermore, CA; Creedy, D.P., Garner, K., (2004) Clean Energy from Underground Coal Gasification in China, , DTI Cleaner Coal Technology Transfer Programme; Report COAL R250; DTI/Pub URN 03/1611; Department of Trade and Industry Technology(DTI): London; Creedy, D.P., Garner, K., Holloway, S., Jones, N., Ren, T.X., (2001) Review of Underground Coal Gasification Technological Advancements, , Report COAL R211; DTI/Pub URN 01/1041; Department of Trade and Industry Technology(DTI): London; (2004) Review of the Feasibility of Underground Coal Gasification in the UK, , Cleaner Fossil Fuels Programme; DTI/Pub URN 04/1643; Department of Trade and Industry Technology(DTI): London; ""Deep Coals"" of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming (2007) Viability of Underground Coal Gasification in the, , Prepared for the Wyoming Business Council Business and Industry Division State Energy Office; GasTech, Inc.:Casper, WY; Sury, M., White, M., Kirton, J., Carr, P., Woodbridge, R., Mostade, M., Chappell, R., Rendell, N., Review of Environmental Issues of Underground Coal Gasification, 2004. , Report COAL R272; DTI/ Pub URN 04/1880; Department of Trade and Industry Technology(DTI):London; Sury, M., White, M., Kirton, J., Carr, P., Woodbridge, R., Mostade, M., Chappell, R., Rendell, N., Review of Environ- Mental Issues of Underground Coal Gasification - Best Practice Guide, 2004. , Report COAL R273; DTI/Pub URN 04/1881; Department of Trade and Industry Technology(DTI): London; Kreinin, E.V., (2004) Nontraditional Thermal Technologies for Production of Heavy-Extractable Fuels: Coal, Hydrocarbons, , OAO Gazprom: Moscow, Russia in Russian; Lazarenko, S.N., Kreinin, E.V., (1994) Underground Coal Gasification in Kuzbass: Present and Future, , Institute of Coal, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Nauka: Novosibirsk, Russia (in Russian; Lazarenko, S.N., Kreinin, E.V., (2006) Underground Coal Gasification in Kuzbass: New Opportunities, , Institute of Coal and Geochemistry, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences: Kemerovo, Russia (in Russian; Gregg, D.W., Edgar, T.F., Underground coal gasification (1978) AIChE J, 24, pp. 753-781; Kreinin, E.V., Fedorov, N.A., Zvyagintsev, K.N., Pyankova, T.M., (1982) Underground Gasification of Coal Seams, , Nedra: Moscow, Russia(in Russian; Antonova, R.I., Bezhanishvili, A.E., Blinderman, M.S., (1990) Underground Coal Gasification in the USSR, , TsNIEIugol: Moscow, Russia (in Russian; Kreinin, E.V., Dvornikova, E.V., Does in-situ gasification of coal seams cause pollution of underground water (1993) Ugol, 4, pp. 39-40. , in Russian; Dvornikova, E.V., Role of sorption properties of gzh-grade coal in self-purification of groundwaters (1996) Ugol, 5, pp. 45-47. , in Russian; Blinderman, M.S., Exergy, E., (2008), Montreal Canada Personal communicationKreinin, E.V., Shifrin, E.I., Mathematical model of coal combustion and gasification in a passage of an underground gas generator (1993) Combust., Explos., Shock Waves, 29, pp. 148-154; Den'Gina, N.I., Kazak, V.N., Pristash, V.V., Changes in rocks at high temperatures (1994) J.
