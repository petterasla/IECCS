The response of marine organisms to the stresses associated with acidification is still not understood, and a number of recent experiments have addressed this problem. The starting point for many of these studies has been the development of a system by which seawater pH can be altered and then maintained. The current paper presents details of a tempera-ture-and pH-controlled microcosm system, which enables the establishment of a tidal regime, for the experimental investigation of intertidal organisms. Two climate scenarios were simulated to evaluate the system's precision and accuracy; Year 2008 ('low' [CO2]: 380 ppm and 14°C) conditions and Year 2100 ('high' [CO2]) conditions (based on the IPCC-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change- 2007 A2 scenario, 'high' [CO2]: 1250 ppm and 2.0 to 5.4°C warming). The temperature and seawater carbonate chemistry were reliably maintained for 30 d during which time newly settled barnacle cyprids were allowed to metamorphose into juveniles, then grow and develop. The pH and [CO2] had 95% confidence intervals of ±0.03 units and ±17 ppm, respectively, under low [CO2] conditions, and of ±0.02 units and ±43 ppm, respectively, under high [CO2] conditions. The tidal regime is fully adjust-able, and on this occasion was set to a 6 h cycle. These microcosms have proved ideal for studying ben-thic organisms from a variety of near-surface environments and at different stages of their life-cycle. © Inter-Research 2008.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Global warming; Intertidal; Larvae; Microcosm; Ocean acidification; pH","Cyprididae; Thoracica",,,,,,"Baulch, H.M., Nord, T.W., Ackerman, M.Y., Dale, J.D., Hazewinkel, R.R.O., Schindler, D.W., Vinebrooke, R.D., Climate warming experiments: Design of a mesocosm heating system (2003) Limnol Oceanogr Methods, 1, pp. 10-15; Beaugrand, G., Reid, P.C., Long-term changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton and salmon related to climate (2003) Glob Change Biol, 9, pp. 801-817; Burke, L., Maidens, J., Reefs at risk in the Caribbean (2004) World Resources Institute, , Washington, DC; Caldeira, K., Wickett, M.E., Anthropogenic carbon and ocean pH (2003) Nature, 425, p. 365; Cameron, J.N., Iwama, G.K., Compensation of progressive hypercapnia in channel catfish and blue crabs (1987) J Exp Biol, 133, pp. 183-197; Chen, C.T.A., Lie, K.K., Macdonald, R., Continental margin exchanges (2003) Ocean Biogeochemistry: A Jgofs Synthesis, pp. 53-97. , In: Fasham MJR (ed), Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg; Chen, C.T.A., Andreev, A., Kim, K.R., Yamamoto, M., Roles of continental shelves and marginal seas in the biogeochemical cycles of the North Pacific Ocean (2004) J Oceanogr, 60, pp. 17-44; Dales, R.P., Mangum, C.P., Tichy, J.C., Effects of changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations on ventilation rhythms in onuphid polychaetes (1970) J Mar Biol Assoc Uk, 50, pp. 365-380; Delille, B., Harlay, J., Zondervan, I., Jacquet, S., Response of primary production and calcification to changes of pCO2 during experimental blooms of the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi (2005) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 19. , and others, GB2023; Fabry, V.J., Shell growth rates of pteropod and heteropod molluscs and aragonite production in the open ocean: Implications of the marine carbonate system (1990) J Mar Res, 48, pp. 209-222; Gattuso, J.P., Frankignoulle, M., Bourge, I., Romaine, S., Budde-Meier, R.W., Effect of calcium carbonate saturation of seawater on coral calcification (1998) Global Planet Change, 18, pp. 37-46; Gattuso, J.P., Frankignoulle, M., Wollast, R., Carbon and carbonate metabolism in coastal aquatic ecosystems (1998) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 29, pp. 405-434; Green, M.A., Jones, M.E., Boudreau, C.L., Moore, R.L., Westman, B.A., Dissolution mortality of juvenile bivalves in coastal marine deposits (2004) Limnol Oceanogr, 49, pp. 727-734; Guinotte, J.M., Orr, J., Cairns, S., Freiwald, A., Morgan, L., George, R., Will human induced changes in seawater chemistry alter the distribution of deep-sea scleractinian corals?
