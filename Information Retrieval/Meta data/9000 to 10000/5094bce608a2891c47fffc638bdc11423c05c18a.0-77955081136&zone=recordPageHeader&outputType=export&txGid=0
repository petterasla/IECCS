Avifauna depend on precipitation for hydration, cover, and food. While there are indications that avian communities respond negatively to drought, little is known about the response of birds with differing functional and behavioural traits, what time periods and indicators of drought are most relevant, or how response varies geographically at broad spatial scales. Our goals were thus to determine (1) how avian abundance and species richness are related to drought, (2) whether community variations are more related to vegetation vigour or precipitation deviations and at what time periods relationships were strongest, (3) how response varies among avian guilds, and (4) how response varies among ecoregions with different precipitation regimes. Using mixed effect models and 1989-2005 North American Breeding Bird Survey data over the central United States, we examined the response to 10 precipitation- and greenness-based metrics by abundance and species richness of the avian community overall, and of four behavioural guilds. Drought was associated with the most negative impacts on avifauna in the semiarid Great Plains, while positive responses were observed in montane areas. Our models predict that in the plains, Neotropical migrants respond the most negatively to extreme drought, decreasing by 13.2% and 6.0% in abundance and richness, while permanent resident abundance and richness increase by 11.5% and 3.6%, respectively in montane areas. In most cases, response of abundance was greater than richness and models based on precipitation metrics spanning 32-week time periods were more supported than those covering shorter time periods and those based on greenness. While drought is but one of myriad environmental variations birds encounter, our results indicate that drought is capable of imposing sizable shifts in abundance, richness, and composition on avian communities, an important implication of a more climatically variable future. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Abundance; Birds; Drought; Great Plains; Greenness; Mixed effects models; North American Breeding Bird Survey; Precipitation; Richness; United States","abundance; bird; climate change; climate variation; community structure; drought; ecoregion; geographical variation; global change; modeling; precipitation (climatology); species richness; Great Plains; United States; Aves",,,,,,"Adams, A.A.Y., Skagen, S.K., Savidge, J.A., Modeling post-fledging survival of Lark Buntings in response to ecological and biological factors (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 178-188; Bailey, R.G., (1995) Description of the Ecoregions of the United States, , USDA Forest Service, Washington, DC; Bannari, A., Huete, A.R., Morin, D., Zagolski, F., Effects of soil color and brightness on vegetation indexes (1996) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 17, pp. 1885-1906; Bock, C.E., Bock, J.H., Response of winter birds to drought and short-duration grazing in southeastern Arizona (1999) Conservation Biology, 13, pp. 1117-1123; Both, C., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.E., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Boulinier, T., Nichols, J.D., Sauer, J.R., Hines, J.E., Pollock, K.H., Estimating species richness: the importance of heterogeneity in species detectability (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1018-1028; Breshears, D.D., Cobb, N.S., Rich, P.M., et al, Regional vegetation die-off in response to global-change-type drought (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102, pp. 15144-15148; Brotons, L., Manosa, S., Estrada, J., Modelling the effects of irrigation schemes on the distribution of steppe birds in Mediterranean farmland (2004) Biodiversity and Conservation, 13, pp. 1039-1058; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , Springer, New York; Christman, B.J., Extreme between-year variation in productivity of a bridled titmouse (Baeolophus wollweberi) population (2002) Auk, 119, pp. 1149-1154; Cox, G.W., The evolution of avian migration systems between temerate and tropical regions of the new world (1985) American Naturalist, 126, pp. 451-474; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Giorgi, F., Pal, J.S., Climate change hotspots in the United States (2008) Geophysical Research Letters, 35; Eidenshink, J., A 16-year time series of 1 km AVHRR satellite data of the conterminous United States and Alaska (2006) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 72, pp. 1027-1035; Faaborg, J., Avian population fluctuations during drought conditions in Puerto Rico (1982) Wilson Bulletin, 94, pp. 20-30; Fuller, R.A., Warren, P.H., Armsworth, P.R., Barbosa, O., Gaston, K.J., Garden bird feeding predicts the structure of urban avian assemblages (2008) Diversity and Distributions, 14, pp. 131-137; Gaston, K.J., Biodiversity and extinction: the importance of being common (2008) Progress in Physical Geography, 32, pp. 73-79; George, T.L., Fowler, A.C., Knight, R.L., McEwen, L.C., Impacts of a severe drought on grassland birds in western North Dakota (1992) Ecological Applications, 2, pp. 275-284; Hayes, M.J., Svoboda, M.D., Wilhite, D.A., Vanyarkho, O.V., Monitoring the 1996 drought using the standardized precipitation index (1999) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 80, pp. 429-438; Hicks, L.E., A ten year study of a bird population in central Ohio (1935) American Midland Naturalist, 16, pp. 177-186; Hilden, O., Habitat selection in birds (1965) Annales Zoologica Fennici, 2, pp. 53-75; Hines, J.E., Boulinier, T., Nichols, J.D., Sauer, J.R., Pollock, K.H., COMDYN: software to study the dynamics of animal communities using a capture-recapture approach (1999) Bird Study, 46, pp. 209-217; Hobson, K.A., Schieck, J., Changes in bird communities in boreal mixedwood forest: harvest and wildfire effects over 30 years (1999) Ecological Applications, 9, pp. 849-863; Hubbard, K.G., DeGaetano, A.T., Robbins, K.D., A modern Applied Climate Information System (2004) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 85, pp. 811-812; Climate change 2007: synthesis report (2007) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 26-73. , Pachauri RK, Reisinger A.
