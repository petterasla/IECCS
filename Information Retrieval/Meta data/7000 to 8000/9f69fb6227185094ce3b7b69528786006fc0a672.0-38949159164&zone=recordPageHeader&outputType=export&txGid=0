The spatial relevance of seasonally frozen ground amounts to c. 55% of the total land area of the northern hemisphere. Evidence suggests that FTCs contribute to nutrient dynamics. Knowledge of their effects on plant communities is scarce, although plants may be the decisive factor in controlling ecosystem functions such as nutrient retention. • Here, the effects are analysed of five additional FTCs in winter for the above- and below-ground productivity of experimental grassland communities and soil enzymatic activity over the following growing season. • Freeze-thaw cycles increased the above-ground productivity but reduced root length over the whole subsequent growing season. In summer, no changes in soil enzymatic activities representing the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles were observed in the FTC-manipulated plots, except for an increased cellobiohydrolase activity. • Changes in productivity resulting in an increased shoot-to-root ratio and shifts in timing are capable of altering ecosystem stability and ecosystem services, such as productivity and nutrient retention. © The Authors (2007).","Above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP); Central Europe; Climate change; EVENT-experiment; Freeze-thaw cycles; Root length; Soil enzymatic activity","aboveground production; carbon cycle; ecosystem function; enzyme activity; freeze-thaw cycle; global warming; grassland; net primary production; nitrogen cycle; nutrient dynamics; phosphorus cycle; plant community; root-shoot ratio; soil ecosystem; article; ecosystem; freezing; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; physiology; plant; plant root; Poaceae; reproduction; soil; time; Ecosystem; Freezing; Greenhouse Effect; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Poaceae; Reproduction; Soil; Time Factors; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe",,"Soil",,,,"Andresen, L.C., Michelsen, A., Off-season uptake of nitrogen in temperate heath vegetation (2005) Oecologia, 144, pp. 585-597; Bates, B.C., Campbell, E.P., A Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for parameter estimation and inference in conceptual rainfall-runoff modeling (2001) Water Resources Research, 37, pp. 937-947; Bilbrough, C.J., Welker, J.M., Bowman, W.D., Early spring nitrogen uptake by snow-covered plants: A comparison of arctic and alpine plant function under the snowpack (2000) Arctic Antarctic and Alpine Research, 32, pp. 404-411; Christensen, S., Christensen, B.T., Organic-matter available for denitrification in different soil fractions - Effect of freeze thaw cycles and straw disposal (1991) Journal of Soil Science, 42, pp. 637-647; Coursolle, C., Bigras, F.J., Margolis, H.A., Effects of root freezing on the physiology and growth of Picea glauca, Picea mariana and Pinus banksiana seedlings under different soil moisture regimes (2002) Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research, 17, pp. 206-217; Faraway, J.J., (2005) Linear Models with R.
