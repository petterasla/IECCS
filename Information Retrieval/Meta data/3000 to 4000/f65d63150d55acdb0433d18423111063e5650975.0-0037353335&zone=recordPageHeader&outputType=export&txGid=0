We studied the interaction of a CO2 doubling and two levels of nitrogen fertilizer on the growth and chemical composition of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreber cv. KY-31) when infected and uninfected with the mutualistic fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams. Two-year-old plants were harvested to 5 cm every 4 weeks, and after 12 weeks of growth plants grown in twice ambient CO2 concentrations: photosynthesized 15% more; produced tillers at a faster rate; produced 53% more dry matter (DM) yield under low N conditions and 61% more DM under high N conditions; the % organic matter (OM) was little changed except under elevated CO2 and high N when %OM increased by 3%; lignin decreased by 14%; crude protein (CP) concentrations (as %DM) declined by 21%; the soluble CP fraction (as %CP) increased by 13%; the acid detergent insoluble CP fraction (as %CP) increased by 12%, and in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility declined by 5% under high N conditions but not under low N. Plants infected with the endophytic fungus: photosynthesized 16% faster in high N compared with under low N; flowered earlier than uninfected plants; had 28% less lignin in high N compared with under low N; and had much smaller reductions in CP concentration (as %DM) and smaller increases in the soluble CP fraction (as %CP) and the acid detergent insoluble CP fraction (as %CP) under elevated CO2. Such large and varied changes in plant quality are likely to have large and significant effects on the herbivore populations that feed from these plants.","Carbon dioxide; Endophytic fungus; Festuca arundinacea; Neotyphodium coenophialum","carbon dioxide enrichment; chemical composition; digestibility; fertilizer application; growth response; herbivory; host-symbiont interaction; mutualism; nitrogen; photosynthesis; United States; Festuca; Fungi; Neotyphodium coenophialum; Schedonorus arundinaceus",,,,,,"Akin, D.E., Kimball, B.A., Mauney, J.R., Influence of enhanced CO2 concentration and irrigation on sudangrass digestibility (1994) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 70, pp. 279-287; Amalric, C., Sallanon, H., Monnet, F., Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence in symbiotic and non-symbiotic rye-grass under water stress (1999) Photosynthetica, 37, pp. 107-112; (1984) Official Methods of Analysis, , AOAC Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, Washington DC; Arachevaleta, M., Bacon, C.W., Hoveland, C.S., Effect of tall fescue endophyte on plant responses to environmental stress (1989) Agronomy Journal, 81, pp. 83-90; Arp, W.J., Effects of source-sink relations on photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 (1991) Plant, Cell and Environment, 14, pp. 869-875; Ashenden, T.W., Baxter, R., Rafarel, C.R., An inexpensive system for exposing plants in the field to elevated concentrations of CO2 (1992) Plant, Cell and Environment, 15, pp. 365-372; Bacon, C.W., Abiotic stress tolerances (moisture, nutrients) and photosynthesis in endophyte-infected tall fescue (1993) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 44, pp. 123-141; Ball, D.M., Pedersen, J.F., Lacefield, G.D., The tall-fescue endophyte (1993) American Scientist, 81, pp. 370-371; Belesky, D.P., Devine, O.J., Pallas, J.E., Photosynthetic activity of tall fescue as influenced by a fungal endophyte (1987) Photosynthetica, 21, pp. 82-87; Belesky, D.P., Wilkinson, S.R., Evans, J.J., Amino acid composition of fractions of 'Kentucky-31' tall fescue as affected by N fertilization and mild water stree (1984) Plant Soil, 81, pp. 257-267; Buckner, R.C., Bush, L.P., (1979) Tall Fescue, , Madison, WI; Carter, D.R., Peterson, K.M., Effects of CO2-enriched atmosphere on the growth and competitive interaction of C3 and C4 grass (1983) Oecologia, 58, pp. 188-193; Cheplick, G.P., Clay, K., Marks, S., Interactions between infection by endophytic fungi and nutrient limitation in the grasses Lolium perenne and Festuca arundinacea (1989) New Phytologist, 111, pp. 89-97; Clay, K., Effects of fungal endophytes on the seed and seedling biology of Lolium perenne and Festuca arundinacea (1987) Oecologia, 73, pp. 358-362; Clay, K., Comparative demography of three graminoids infected by systemic, clavicipitaceous fungi (1990) Ecology, 71, pp. 558-570; Coleman, J.S., McConnaughay, K.D.M., Bazzaz, F.A., Elevated CO2 and plant nitrogen-use: Is reduced tissue nitrogen concentration size-dependent?
