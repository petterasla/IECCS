This study examined the effects of seawater temperature, as a proxy for climate change, on B. violaceus and D. listerianum and the impact these ascidians have on native sessile fouling communities. Field experiments were conducted over a four month period at two locations (Lynn and Woods Hole, MA) to examine growth dynamics over regional thermal and geographic ranges. Invasive ascidians occupied as much as 80% of the primary substratum and accounted for the majority of species richness. B. violaceus and D. listerianum growth were similar at both study sites, but initial colony growth of D. listerianum was positively affected by temperature. B. violaceus and D. listerianum exhibited rapid two-week growth rates during the summer months with more rapid growth at the warmer Woods Hole site. Competition for space between B. violaceus and D. listerianum typically resulted in neutral borders between colonies. Overgrowth occurred if the colony of one species was disproportionably larger than the colony of the other species. Recruitment and growth of native species influenced the long-term composition of experimental communities more than the pre-seeding with B. violaceus or D. listerianum colonies. Elevated temperatures, however, increased initial growth of B. violaceus and D. listerianum and may have facilitated the species success to invade the communities during crucial periods of introduction. With projected global climate change, a rise in sea surface temperatures may exacerbate the cumulative impacts of invasions on benthic communities and facilitate the invasion of other non-native ascidian species. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
