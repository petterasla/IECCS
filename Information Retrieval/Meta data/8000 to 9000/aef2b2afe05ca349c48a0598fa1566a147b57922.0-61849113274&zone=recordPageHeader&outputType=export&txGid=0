Garhwal University, Srinagar, Uttarakhand, India","This article briefly describes the major tropical biomes, outlines various forces that are currently driving changes in human - natural ecosystem interactions, and discusses the Himalaya - Gangetic Plains relationships. Tropical rain forests of different continents differ widely in key biological factors and threats to which they are subjected. In Amazonia and Himalayas - Gangetic Plains system, tropics have two extraordinary systems of global significance. While Amazonia stands out for its unbelievable biodiversity and the sheer dimensions of the river basin, Himalayan ecosystem services sustain the agricultural activity in the Gangetic Plains that supports nearly 500 million people. Tropical countries are predicted to suffer more from global warming, and it will be a great setback to the poor of the world who only now have begun to taste some benefits of a rapid economic growth. Tropical countries have comparatively much lower eco-footprints than developed countries, but situation is changing at least in some countries. There is a positive relationship between per capita GDP and environmental quality, but this may not hold true for a much larger population at a high consumption rate .The temperate region countries could maintain a clean environment despite their high per capita consumption, partly by exploiting environment of other countries. Tropical countries would not have freedom to exploit environment of other countries, and their development activities are going to encounter a severe energy crisis, and problems of a world the carrying capacity of which has already been exceeded. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Amazonia; Climate change; Conservation issues; Eco-footprints; Forest degradation; Himalaya-Gangetic system; Tropical rainforests","biodiversity; ecology; economic growth; environmental quality; global warming; Gross Domestic Product; nature-society relations; tropical environment; Amazonia; Asia; Eurasia; Gangetic Plain; Himalayas; South America; South Asia",,,,,,"Arnold, J.F.M., Clarifying the link between forests and poverty reduction (2002) International Forestry Review, 4, pp. 231-233; Ayukawa, Y., Naoyuki, Y., Chen, D., Chestin, I., Kokorin, A., Denruyter, J.P., Fabbri, M., Winker, H., (2007) Climate Solutions, , WWF's Vision for 2050.
