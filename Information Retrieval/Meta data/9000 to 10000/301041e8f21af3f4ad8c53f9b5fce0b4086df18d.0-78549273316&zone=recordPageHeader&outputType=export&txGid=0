Carbon dioxide (CO2) or R744 is an attractive candidate to replace harmful hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, which will need to be replaced in the near future due to their high global warming potential. In this paper the tribological behavior of gray cast iron in the presence of CO2 under unlubricated conditions was investigated. Specifically different regions of the CO2 pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram were studied to understand the role of pressure, temperature, CO2 mass, and the chemical interaction of gray cast iron with CO2, focusing on their impact on the friction and wear behavior. It was found that friction decreases significantly when CO2 pressure and temperature approach the gas-liquid transition in the P-T phase diagram, thus exhibiting a form of ""superlubricity."" Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy it was found that an increase in CO2 pressure causes partial transformation of iron oxides into iron carbonates which have a positive effect on the tribological performance. The thickness of the tribolayer film, formed in the contact zone, was evaluated using Focus Ion Beam and it was found to be of the order of 0.5μm. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide refrigerant; Compressors; Gray cast iron; Scuffing; Tribolayers; XPS","Chemical interactions; Contact zone; Environmental concerns; Environmentally-friendly; Focus ion beam; Friction and wear behaviors; Gas liquids; Global warming potential; Gray cast iron; Hydrofluorocarbons; Iron carbonates; Natural refrigerants; P-T phase diagram; Partial transformation; Positive effects; Pressure and temperature; Refrigeration compressors; Scuffing; Superlubricity; Tribolayers; Tribological behaviors; Tribological performance; XPS; Air conditioning; Carbon dioxide; Compressors; Friction; Global warming; Iron oxides; Phase diagrams; Pressure effects; Refrigerants; Refrigeration; Tribology; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Cast iron",,,,,,"Kim, M.H., Pettersen, J., Bullard, C.W., Fundamental process and systems design issues in CO2 vapor compression systems (2004) Prog.
