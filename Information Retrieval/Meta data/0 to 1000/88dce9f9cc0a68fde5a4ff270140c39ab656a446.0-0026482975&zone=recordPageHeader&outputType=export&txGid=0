Then the response of the active layer to climatic warming was incorporated into HBV, a hydrologic model, to elucidate the effects on the hydrologic regime. Several scenarios of climatic warming have been examined to determine the impact on the active layer depth, but only results of 4°C warming at a typical arctic site will be presented here. In the case of 4°C warming, three scenarios of precipitation were studied: no change, +15%, and -15%. The most obvious and perhaps significant response to climatic warming was an increase in active layer depth. Other changes worth noting were warming of the entire soil profile, increased soil moisture storage, increased evaporation, and variable response in runoff, depending upon the scenario. Evaporation now vies with runoff as the primary loss of moisture from the watershed. -from Authors",,"arctic watershed; global warming; heat conduction model; permafrost; precipitation change; runoff; soil moisture storage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026482975
