Cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) surface exposure dating of moraine boulders defines the timing of each glacial advance and refines the previous glacial chronologies. The CRN data show that glaciation was most extensive during the early part of the last glacial (marine oxygen isotype stage [MIS] 3 and earlier), but limited during MIS 2 (the global Last Glacial Maximum) and the Holocene. A previously assumed Neoglacial advance is dated to 3.6 ± 0.3 ka and the CRN dates confirm a glacial advance ca. 1 ka. These results show that glaciations on the south side of Everest were not synchronous with the advance of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, yet glaciations within the Himalaya, the world's highest mountain belt, were synchronous during the late Quaternary. The existence of glacial advances during times of increased insolation suggests that enhanced moisture delivered by an active south Asian summer monsoon is largely responsible for glacial advances in this part of the Himalaya. These data allow us to quantify the importance of global climate change and monsoon influence on glaciation in the Himalaya.","Cosmogenic radionuclides; Everest; Geochronology; Glacial geology; Himalaya; Monsoon","Surface exposure; Climate change; Geochronology; Moisture; Radioisotopes; Surface phenomena; Glacial geology; beryllium isotope; cosmogenic radionuclide; dating method; geochronology; glacial deposit; glaciation; Holocene; isotopic composition; monsoon; moraine; Pleistocene; Pliocene; Asia",,,,,,"Aoki, T., Imamura, M., Reconstructing the glacial chronology based on the 10Be exposure age in the Khumbu Glacier, Eastern Nepal Himalaya (1999) Proceedings of the Korea-Japan/Japan-Korea Geomorphological Conference, pp. 134-135; Barnard, P.L., Owen, L.A., Finkel, R.C., Style and timing of glacial and paraglacial sedimentation in a monsoonal influenced high Himalayan environment, the upper Bhugirathi Valley, Garthwal Himalaya (2003) Sedimentary Geology, , in press; Benedict, J.B., Khumbu glacier series, Nepal (1976) Radiocarbon, 18, pp. 177-178; Benn, D., Owen, L.A., The role of the Indian summer monsoon and the mid-latitude westerlies in Himalayan glaciation: Review and speculative discussion (1998) Geological Society of London Journal, 155, pp. 353-363; Bond, G., Heinrich, H., Broecker, W., Labeyrie, L., McManus, J., Andrews, J., Huon, S., Ivy, S., Evidence for massive discharges of icebergs into the North Atlantic during the last glacial period (1992) Nature, 360, pp. 245-249; Clark, P.U., Mix, A.C., Ice sheets and sea level of the Last Glacial Maximum (2002) Quaternary Science Reviews, 21. , eds., 454 p; Fushimi, H., Glaciations in the Khumbu Himal (1977) Seppyo, 39, pp. 60-67; Fushimi, H., Glaciations in the Khumbu Himal (1978) Sepyo, 40, pp. 71-77; Gillespie, A., Molnar, P., Asynchronous maximum advances of mountain and continental glaciers (1995) Reviews of Geophysics, 33, pp. 311-364; Grove, J.M., (1988) The Little Ice Age, , London, Routledge, 489 p; Iwata, S., Late Pleistocene and Holocene moraines in the Sagamartha (Everest) region, Khumbu Himal (1976) Seppyo, 38, pp. 109-114; Müller, F., Present and late Pleistocene equilibrium line altitudes in the Mt.
