Therefore, it seems necessary to seek full-fledged replacement of fossil fuels. Such an alternative are biofuels. Algae can be source of several types of renewable biofuels. Starting from the methane generated in the processes of anaerobic decomposition of biomass, by biodiesel made from algal oil, until photobiological hydrogen production. The idea of using algae to produce fuel is not new, but until now it is taken into account, due to the rising prices of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and the need of reduction of global warming, which is associated with the burning of fossil fuels. The article presents the results of the efficiency of microalgae biomass production using effluent from the methane fermentation bioreactors as food. For the algal culture production tubular photobioreactors was used. The study was conducted simultaneously in two identical systems, of which one was fed with a synthetic food, and the other one used efluent from fermenters. In both systems, the amount of nutrients entering was identical. The study was conducted for 48 days, every three days, the compactness of dry matter and dry organic matter were determined in bioreactors. In filtrate remaining after the analysis of weight of dry matter content, organic compounds as COD, total nitrogen content (as total organic nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate and nitrite) and total phosphorus was determined. Every six days from each photobioreactor 0.5 l of the algae mixture was taken, and then the reactor was supplemented with an equal volume of synthetic food under option 1, or the effluent from the fermenter in option 2. Our results indicate the possibility of using effluent from the fermenter as food for algae culture production. The resulting biomass growth rates were similar in both systems. They amounted to 56.3 mgs.mo/l · d for a variant with synthetic food and 54.3 mgs.mo/l · d with application of effluent. Photobioreactors can be an effective solution for collecting and storing biomass collected from wild algae. They can be a source of substrate fermentation reactors to power in winter when the availability of algae from the environment is small. A considerable potential for application of the effluents from the reactors as a fermentation medium for the cultivation of algae.",,,,,,,,"Chen, C.Y., Yeh, K.L., Aisyah, R., Lee, D.J., Chang, J.S., Cultivation, photobioreactor design and harvesting of microalgae for biodiesel production: A critical review (2011) Bioresource Technology, 102, pp. 71-81; Chisti, Y., Biodiesel from microalgae (2007) Biotechnol.
