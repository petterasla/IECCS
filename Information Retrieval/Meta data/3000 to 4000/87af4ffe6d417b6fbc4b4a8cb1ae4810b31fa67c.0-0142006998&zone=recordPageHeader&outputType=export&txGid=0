Lean production can provide some short-term emission mitigation, at the level of the Kyoto requirements. In the middle term, more use of scrap will also help alleviate emissions. But to reach much larger reductions in GHG emissions, on a par with the likely targets that will be set after the Kyoto period, the steel industry will have to imagine new production paradigms, which constitutes its most formidable challenge for the years to come. Carbon capture and sequestration, processes leaner in carbon use, electricity and hydrogen from green sources will have to be added together in a patchwork of process routes, which will have to be developed at great risk in the next decade, hopefully through broad international cooperation.",,"Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Electricity; Global warming; Hydrogen; Alleviate emissions; Iron and steel industry",,,,,,"Brundtland, G.H., Our common future (1987) UN Report; Birat, J.-P., Vizioz, J.-P., Jeanneau, M., Schneider, M., CO2 emissions and the steel industry's available responses to the Greenhouse effect (2000) Proc.
