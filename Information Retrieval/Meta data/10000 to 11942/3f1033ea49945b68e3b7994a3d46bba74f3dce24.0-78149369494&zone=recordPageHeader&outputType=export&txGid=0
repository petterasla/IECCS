Change detection using remote sensing, especially in the rugged mountains such as higher Himalaya, requires a series of careful steps including selection of appropriate methodology and sufficient ground knowledge. Based on remote sensing techniques a recent study by Panigrahy et al. (2010) reported an upward shift of timberline vegetation by 300 m and a considerable reduction in snow cover in Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR), Garhwal Himalaya. Their study has overlooked a number of methodological issues and misinterpreted some of the vegetation classes. In this communication we provide a brief critique on the methodology adopted by these authors and suggest certain precautions while undertaking change detection studies in the Himalayan region using remote sensing techniques. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Change detection; Nanda devi biosphere reserve; Remote sensing; Snow cover; Timberline vegetation","detection method; environmental monitoring; land cover; land use; remote sensing; satellite imagery; snow cover; timber; topographic mapping; vegetation type; India; Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve; Uttarakhand",,,,,,"Adhikari, B.S., Ecological attributes of vegetation in and around Nanda Devi National Park (2004) Biodiversity Monitoring Expedition Nanda Devi 2003, pp. 30-35. , A Report to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govt. of India, Uttaranchal State Forest Department, Dehradun; Biging, G.S., Colby, D.R., Congalton, R.G., Sampling systems for change detection accuracy assessment (1998) Remote Sensing Change Detection: Environmental Monitoring Methods and Applications, pp. 281-308. , In: R.
