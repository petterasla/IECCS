Compared to the 1960s, the increase, which in the 1980s amounted to a factor of three for economic losses and a factor of five for insured losses, has since escalated to factors of eight and fifteen respectively. The principal causes are progressive urbanization, the settlement and industrialization of hazard-prone regions, the vulnerability of modern technologies as well as anthropogenic environmental change. Climatic and other environmental changes are having an ever growing influence on the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. This is demonstrated by the great windstorm disasters of recent years as well as by the countless flood, storm, drought and forest-fire disasters triggered by increasingly frequent extreme weather events, which already account for the dominant part of all disaster losses. The insurance industry is capable of protecting itself adequately against the expected future increase of disaster losses and at the same time making a significant contribution to implementing measures to protect the climate. No other sector of the economy has such effective instruments for encouraging risk reduction. However, this can only work if the insurance industry has both its clients and the authorities on its side as motivated partners.","Climate change; Insurance; Natural disasters","economic analysis; global warming; insurance industry; natural disaster",,,,,,"Berz, G., Naturkatastrophen an der Wende zum nächsten Jahrhundert - Trends, Schadenpotentiale und Handlungsoptionen der Versicherungswirtschaft (1999) Zeitschrift Für Die Gesamte Versicherungswissenschaft, 2 (3), pp. 427-442; (1996) Review of the Potential Effects of Climate Change in the UK, , Department of Environment London; Dronia, H., Zum vermehrten Auftreten extremer Tiefdruckgebiete über dem Nordatlantik (1991) Die Witterung in Übersee, 39 (3), pp. 27-32; (2001), IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report Cambridge(1997) Überschwemmung Und Versicherung, , Münchener Rück: München; (1997) Treibhaus Erde - Die Extreme Nehmen Zu, pp. 13-15. , Münchener Rück: München, = Topics; (1999) Jahrtausendrückblick Naturkatastrophen, , Münchener Rück: München. = Topics; (1999) Naturkatastrophen in Deutschland, , Münchener Rück: München; (2001) Jahresrückblick Naturkatastrophen 2000, , Münchener Rück: München. = Topics; Reuvekamp, A., Klein Tank, A., Probability estimates of extreme winter rainfall in a changing climate (1996) Climate Change, 30, pp. 8-10","Berz, G.; Munchener Rüc.-Gesellschaft, Forschungsgruppe GeoRisiken, München 80791, Germany; email: GBerz@munichre.com",,,,,,,,00316229,,,,"German","Petermanns Geogr.
