Removing atmospheric carbon and storing it in the terrestrial biosphere is one of the cost-effective options, to compensate greenhouse gas emission. Millions of acres of abandoned mine land throughout the world, if restored and converted into vegetative land, would solve two major problems of global warming and generation of degraded wasteland. In this study, a manganese spoil dump at Gumgaon, Nagpur in India was reclaimed, using an integrated biotechnological approach (IBA). The physicochemical and microbiological status of the mine land improved after reclamation. Soil organic carbon (SOC) pool increased from 0.104% to 0.69% after 20 years of reclamation in 0-15 cm spoil depth. Soil organic carbon level of reclaimed site was also compared with a native forestland and agricultural land. Forest soil showed highest SOC level of 1.11% followed by reclaimed land and agriculture land of 0.70% and 0.40%, respectively. Soil profile studies of all three sites showed that SOC pool decreased from 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm depths. Although reclaimed land showed less carbon than forestland, it showed better SOC accumulation rate. Reclamation of mine lands by using IBA is an effective method for mitigating CO2 emissions. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Global warming; Greenhouse gas; Integrated biotechnological approach (IBA); Mine land; Soil organic carbon","Abandoned mine lands; Accumulation rates; Agricultural land; Atmospheric carbon; Biotechnological approaches; Carbon emissions; Carbon sequestration; Forest land; Forest soils; Integrated biotechnological approach (IBA); Reclaimed land; Soil organic carbon; Soil profiles; Terrestrial biosphere; Abandoned mines; Biotechnology; Chelation; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Manganese; Manganese mines; Mining; Organic carbon; Programmable logic controllers; Reclamation; Soils; Land reclamation; manganese; organic carbon; abandoned mine; carbon sequestration; global warming; greenhouse gas; manganese; reclaimed land; soil organic matter; agricultural land; article; biotechnology; controlled study; environmental reclamation; forest soil; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; India; mining; physical chemistry; soil analysis; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; India; Manganese; Mining; Soil; Biotechnology; Carbon; Chelation; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Greenhouses; Land; Leakage; Mining; Reclamation; Soil; India; Maharashtra; Nagpur",,"manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Manganese, 7439-96-5; Soil",,,,"Akala, V.A., Lal, R., Potential of mine land reclamation for soil organic carbon sequestration in Ohio (2000) Land Degradation and Development, 11 (3), pp. 289-297. , DOI 10.1002/1099-145X(200005/06)11:3<289::AID-LDR385>3.0.CO;2-Y; Akala, V.A., Lal, R., Soil organic pools and sequestration rates in reclaimed minesoils in Ohio (2001) Journal of Environmental Quality, 30, pp. 2098-2104. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD38Xht1Sltrw%3D; Amonette, J.E., Kim, J., Colleen Russell, K., Palumbo, A.V., Lee Daniels, W., (2003) International Ash Utilisation Symposium, , Centre for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky Paper 47; Anderson, T.H., Domsch, K.H., Application of eco-physiological quotients (qCO2 and qD) on microbial biomasses from soils of different cropping histories (1990) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 22, pp. 251-255. , 10.1016/0038-0717(90)90094-G doi:10.1016/0038-0717(90)90094-G; Barnhisel, R.I., Hower, J.M., Coal surface mine reclamation in the eastern cropland (1997) Advances in Agronomy, 61, pp. 233-275. , 10.1016/S0065-2113(08)60665-3 doi:10.1016/S0065-2113(08)60665-3; (2000) Reclamation of Drastically Disturbed Lands, p. 1082. , Barnhisel R.
