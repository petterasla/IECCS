We show that the spatial patterns of tropical ocean temperature trends have a strong influence on global mean temperature and precipitation and on global mean radiative forcing. We identify the SST patterns with the greatest influence on the global mean climate and find very different, and often opposing, sensitivities to SST changes in the tropical Indian and West Pacific Oceans. Our work stresses the need to reduce climate model biases in these sensitive regions, as they not only affect the regional climates of the nearby densely populated continents, but also have a disproportionately large effect on the global climate. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"climate modeling; global warming; sea surface temperature; sensitivity analysis; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West)",,,,,,"Alexander, M.A., Blade, I., Newman, M., Lanzante, J.R., Lau, N.C., Scott, J.D., The atmospheric bridge: The influence of ENSO teleconnections on air-sea interaction over the global oceans (2002) J Clim, 15, pp. 2205-2231; Barsugli, J.J., Sardeshmukh, P.D., Global atmospheric sensitivity to tropical SST anomalies throughout the Indo-Pacific basin (2002) J Clim, 15, pp. 3427-3442; Bony, S., Lau, K.M., Sud, Y.C., Sea surface temperature and large-scale circulation influences on tropical greenhouse effect and cloud radiative forcing (1997) J Clim, 10, pp. 2055-2077; Branstator, G., Analysis of general circulation model sea-surface temperature anomaly simulations using a linear model.
