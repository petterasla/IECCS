The objective of this study is to determine the NPSI for locating potential area of the nonpoint source pollution in the Upper Lam Phra Phloeng watershed, Thailand, using GIS and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Potentials of run-off, sediment yield, and nutrient yield of the study area were raster-based quantified to be indexes by the score range procedure of the linear transformation. These indexes were integrated using the decision rule as the Simple Additive Weighting with different weights assigned for those potentials. Due to having a small number of criteria and their simple relationship, the rank sum method was applied to weight assignment. As an integration result, the NPSI is available for each grid cell in the watershed. The NPSI was further classified to indicate the level of environmental sensitivity of areas. This spatial distribution information is helpful for examining the pattern of diffuse pollution and could facilitate the decision on NPS pollution management at local level.","GIS; MCDA; Nonpoint source pollution index","Control management; Diffuse pollution; Environmental sensitivities; MCDA; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Non-point source pollution; Simple additive weighting; Weight assignment; Geographic information systems; Remote sensing; Watersheds; Water pollution",,,,,,"Drewry, J.J., Newham, L.T.H., Croke, B.F.W., Suspended sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and exports during storm-events to the Tuross Estuary, Australia (2009) Journal of Environmental Management, 90 (2), pp. 879-887; Edwards, A.C., Withers, P.J.A., Transport and delivery of suspended solids, nitrogen and phosphorus from various sources to freshwaters in the UK (2008) Journal of Hydrology, 350, pp. 144-153; Giupponi, C., Rosato, P., Simulating impacts of agricultural policy on nitrogen losses from a watershed on Northern Italy (1995) Environment International, 21 (5), pp. 577-582; Guo, H.Y., Wang, X.R., Zhu, J.G., Quantification and index of non-point pollution in taihu lake region with GIS (2004) Environmental Geochemistry and Health, 26, pp. 147-156; Hamlett, J.M., Miller, D.A., Day, R.L., Peterson, G.W., Baumer, G.M., Russo, J., Statewide GIS-based ranking of watersheds for agricultural pollution prevention (1992) Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, 47 (5), pp. 399-404; Li, K.C., Yeh, M.C., Nonpoint source pollution potential index: A case study of the Feitsui Reservoir Watershed, Taiwan (2004) Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, 27 (2), pp. 253-259; Malczewski, J., (1999) GIS and Multicriteria Decision Analysis, pp. 101-223. , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Stillwell, W.G., Seaver, D.A., Edwards, W., A comparison of weight approximation techniques in multiattribute utility decision making (1981) Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 28 (1), pp. 62-77; Phetprayoon, T., Sarapirome, S., Navanugraha, C., Wonprasaid, S., Surface runoff estimation using grid-based curve number method in the upper lam phra phloeng Watershed, Thailand (2009) 30th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, pp. 1-6. , Beijing, China, TS-22.5; Zhang, H., Huang, G.H., Assessment of non-point source pollution using a spatial multicriteria analysis approach (2011) Ecological Modelling, 222, pp. 313-321","Phetprayoon, T.; Program of Geoinformatics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University, 340, Suranarai Rd., Muang, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand; email: tharapong_gis@hotmail.com",,"ATHI TELECOM;e-geos;Thales Alenia Space;TELESPAZIO;SPACEALLIANCE",,"33rd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2012, ACRS 2012","26 November 2012 through 30 November 2012","Pattaya",97670,,9781622769742,,,"English","Asian Conf.
