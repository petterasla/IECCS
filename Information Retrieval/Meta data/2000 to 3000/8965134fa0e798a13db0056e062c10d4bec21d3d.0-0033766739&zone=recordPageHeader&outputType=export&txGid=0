The pollen record was used as a template for the identification of synchronous levels between cores. 2 A non-random pattern of change in bryophyte macrofossils and humification was simultaneous between all four cores. Stratigraphic changes occurred independently of human land-use and were best interpreted as palaeoclimatic events. Remains of Racomitrium lanuginosum and Sphagnum papillosum, in conjunction with changes in peat humification, provided the clearest indication of past increases in climatic wetness ('wetshifts') to impact upon mire hydrology and ecology. 3 Eight wetshifts were identified and radiocarbon-dated, beginning at c. 3250, 2550, 2150, 1400, 1150, 875, 600 and 325 calibrated years BP (cal. BP). Seven of these wetshifts match closely with palaeoclimatic events from a range of mires previously examined in Britain and Ireland. We suggest that blanket mires may provide the best source of decade- to century-scale palaeoclimatic information in oceanic north-west Europe. 4 The proxy-climatic evidence indicates that: (i) the extinction of Sphagnum imbricatum at Kentra Moss (at c. 1400 cal. BP) was caused by an increase in climatic and mire surface wetness, when it was replaced first by Racomitrium lanuginosum and then by Sphagnum papillosum; and (ii) that increased climatic wetness and human land-use were responsible for the shift from an early minerotrophic peatland to ombrotrophic blanket mire at c. 4070 cal. BP. 5 Given the evidence for a prevailing climatic effect on the development of Kentra Moss, the effect of human-induced global warming on Britain's blanket mire resource will probably be significant. British blanket mires have international conservation status, and future changes in their ecology will challenge conservationists, academics and politicians.","Climate change; Peat humification; Racomitrium lanuginosum; Sphagnum spp.","climate; environmental monitoring; fossil; humification; Ireland; mire; united kingdom; wetness; blanket bog; climate effect; humification; mire; paleoclimate; paleoecology; vegetation history; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Aaby, B., Cyclic climatic variations in climate over the past 5,500 yr. reflected in raised bogs (1976) Nature, London, 263, pp. 281-284; Adams, J.M., Faure, H., A new estimate of changing carbon storage on land since the last glacial maximum, based on global land ecosystem reconstruction (1998) Global and Planetary Change, 16, pp. 3-24; Adams, J.M., Faure, H., Faure-Denard, L., McGlade, J.M., Woodward, F.I., Increases in terrestrial carbon storage from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present (1990) Nature, London, 348, pp. 711-714; Alm, J., Sculman, L., Walden, J., Nykanen, H., Martikainen, P.J., Silvola, J., Carbon balance of a boreal bog during a year with an exceptionally dry summer (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 161-174; Anderson, D.E., A reconstruction of Holocene climatic changes from peat bogs in North-West Scotland (1998) Boreas, 27, pp. 208-224; Anderson, D.E., Binney, H.A., Smith, M.A., Evidence for abrupt climatic change in northern Scotland between 3900 and 3500 calender years B.P.
