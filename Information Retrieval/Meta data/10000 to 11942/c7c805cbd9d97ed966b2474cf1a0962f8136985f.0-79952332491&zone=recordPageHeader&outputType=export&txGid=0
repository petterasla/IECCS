However, there is likely to be a negative feedback between climate change and human wealth: economic growth is typically associated with an increase in CO2 emissions and globalwarming, but the resulting climate change may lead to damages that suppress economic growth. This climate-economy feedback is assumed to be weak in standard climate change assessments. When the feedback is incorporated in a transparently simple model it reveals possible emergent behaviour in the coupled climate-economy system. Formulae are derived for the critical rates of growth of global CO2 emissions that cause damped or long-term boom-bust oscillations in human wealth, thereby preventing a soft landing of the climate-economy system. On the basis of this model, historical rates of economic growth and decarbonization appear to put the climate-economy system in a potentially damaging oscillatory regime. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Economic growth; Feedback; Instability","Anthropocene; Anthropogenic climate change]; Climate change assessment; Critical rates; Economic growth; Economic growths; Economic output; Emergent behaviours; Global CO; Highly-correlated; Instability; Negative feedback; Oscillatory regimes; Soft landing; Climate models; Economics; Feedback; Climate change",,,,,,"Harvell, C.D., Mitchell, C.E., Ward, J.R., Altizer, S., Dobson, A.P., Ostfeld, R.S., Samuel, M.D., Climate warming and disease risks for terrestrial and marine biota (2002) Science, 296 (5576), pp. 2158-2162. , DOI 10.1126/science.1063699; Adger, W., Kajfe-Bogataj, L., Parry, M., Canziani, O., Palutikof, J., (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Nordhaus, W., (2008) A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Stern, N., (2007) The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Stott, P.A., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, G.S., Allen, M.R., Mitchell, J.F.B., Jenkins, G.J., External control of 20th century temperature by natural and anthropogenic forcings (2000) Science, 290 (5499), pp. 2133-2137. , DOI 10.1126/science.290.5499.2133; Barker, T., Ekins, P., Johnstone, N., (1995) Global Warming and Energy Demand, , London, UK: Routledge; Soden, B.J., Held, I.M., An assessment of climate feedbacks in coupled ocean-atmosphere models (2006) Journal of Climate, 19 (14), pp. 3354-3360. , DOI 10.1175/JCLI3799.1; Cox, P., Stephenson, D., A changing climate for prediction (2007) Science, 317 (5835), pp. 207-208. , DOI 10.1126/science.1145956; Schnellnhuber, H., Cramer, W., (2006) Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Meadows, D., Meadows, D., Randers, J., (2004) Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Global Update, , White River Junction, VT: Chelsea Green Publishing; Volterra, V., Variations and fluctuations of the number of individuals in animal species living together (1928) ICES J.
