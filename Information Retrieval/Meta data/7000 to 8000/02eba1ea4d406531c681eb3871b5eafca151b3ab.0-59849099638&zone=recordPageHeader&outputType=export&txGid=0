Insight into environmental effects upon en route decisions by migrants can therefore be a critical first step toward assessing their vulnerability to future climatic shifts. We extracted behaviour-related parameters from a recent formulation of multistate mark-recapture models, and used them to evaluate the importance of variation in local weather and broad-scale climate to decisions made by autumn passerine migrants at a coastal stopover site in Atlantic Canada. We found dramatic interannual fluctuations in the proportion of migrants that were transient (departing within a day of arrival), with annual average values ranging from 24% to 96% over the years 1996-2007. However, the relationships of stopover behaviour (transience and departure probability) to local weather (wind and precipitation) and to regional climatic fluctuations were similar across three distinct species groups and for birds of different fuel-loads, indicating the potential for both immediate (day-to-day) and long-term environmental influences (spanning several seasons). This cross-scale approach contributes valuable information toward the conservation of migrants in the face of a changing climate by (i) quantifying environmental influences on stopover behaviour in broad temporal and geographic contexts, and (ii) demonstrating largely parallel interannual variation in stopover site-use among birds with contrasting migratory timing and strategies. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Autumn; Climate; Departure; ENSO; Mark-recapture; Migration; NAO; Passerine; Stopover; Weather","annual variation; autumn; climate change; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental effect; life cycle; mark-recapture method; migratory species; North Atlantic Oscillation; passerine; stopover; Canada; North America; Aves; Passeriformes",,,,,,"Adahl, E., Lundberg, P., Jonzén, N., From climate change to population change: The need to consider annual life cycles (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 1627-1633; Ahola, M., Laaksonen, T., Sippola, K., Eeva, T., Rainio, K., Lehikoinen, E., Variation in climate warming along the migration route uncouples arrival and breeding dates (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 1-8; Akaike, H., Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , In: (eds Petrov BN, Csaki F), Akademiai Kiado, Budapest, Hungary; Åkesson, S., Hedenström, A., Wind selectivity of migratory flight departures in birds (2000) Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology, 47, pp. 140-144; Åkesson, S., Walinder, G., Karlsson, L., Ehnbom, S., Reed warbler orientation: Initiation of nocturnal migratory flights in relation to visibility of celestial cues at dusk (2001) Animal Behaviour, 61, pp. 181-189; Alerstam, T., Wind as a selective agent in bird migration (1979) Ornis Scandinavica, 10, pp. 76-93; Alerstam, T., Hedenström, A., Åkesson, S., Long-distance migration: Evolution and determinants (2003) Oikos, 103, pp. 247-260; Alerstam, T., Lindström, A., Optimal bird migration: The relative importance of time, energy and safety (1990) Bird Migration: Physiology and Ecophysiology, pp. 331-351. , In: (ed.
