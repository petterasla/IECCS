This consisted of two parts: one addressing the influence of thermal metrology on society, industry, and science, and the other specifying the requirements of enabling thermal metrology to serve future needs. The roadmap represents the shared vision of the EUROMET TC Therm committee as to how thermal metrology should develop to meet future requirements over the next 15 years. It is important to stress that these documents are a first attempt to roadmap the whole of thermal metrology and will certainly need regular review and revision to remain relevant and useful to the community they seek to serve. The first part of the roadmap, ""Thermal metrology for society, industry, and science,"" identifies the main social and economic triggers driving developments in thermal metrology-notably citizen safety and security, new production technologies, environment and global climate change, energy, and health. Stemming from these triggers, key targets are identified that require improved thermal measurements. The second part of the roadmap, ""Enabling thermal metrology to serve future needs"" identifies another set of triggers, like global trade and interoperability, future needs in transport, and the earth radiation budget. Stemming from these triggers, key targets are identified, such as improved realizations and dissemination of the SI unit the kelvin, anchoring the kelvin to the Boltzmann constant, k B, and calculating thermal properties from first principles. To facilitate these outcomes, the roadmap identifies the technical advances required in thermal measurement standards. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Future developments; Roadmap; Thermal metrology","Boltzmann constants; Earth radiation budgets; EUROMET; First principles; Future developments; Global climate changes; Global trades; New production technologies; Review and revisions; Roadmap; Shared visions; Technical advances; Thermal measurements; Thermal metrology; Thermal properties; Climate change; Climatology; Investments; Technological forecasting; Thermal variables measurement; Thermodynamic properties; Measurements",,,,,,"http://www.euromet.org/projects/imera/, iMERA project documentation atMicrosystems Technology Standardisation Roadmap, , http://www.memstand.org; Bell, S., Int.
