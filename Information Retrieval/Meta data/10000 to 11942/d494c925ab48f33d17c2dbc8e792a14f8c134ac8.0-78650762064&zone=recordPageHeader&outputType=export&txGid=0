However, the preponderance of data is correlative and few quantitative tests exist that dissect the relative effects of changing temperature on host and pathogen responses. In this study, we experimentally tested the effect overwintering temperature had on the susceptibility of a vertebrate ectothermic host, the common toad Bufo bufo, to infection and mortality caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We show that a 'poor' (warmer) overwintering regime increases the probability of infection, supporting the concept that the dynamics of infection are altered by changing environmental temperature profiles. We also show once established, the proliferation of Bd in the host was better in toadlets that experienced a 'good' (colder) winter. We find no relationship between survival and the different overwintering regimes or any consistent deleterious influence of disease on survival. Instead, survival is overwhelmingly predicted by measurements of condition (mass, mass lost over winter) that were not determined by overwintering temperature. We conclude that the survival of a cohort of overwintering toadlets is primarily driven by patterns of growth during the larval period rather than winter temperature or infectious disease. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bufo bufo; Climate warming; Condition; Host/parasite; Infection; Mortality","amphibian; climate change; climate effect; experimental study; global warming; host-parasite interaction; mortality; overwintering; survival; temperature anomaly; Amphibia; Anura; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bufo bufo; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Altwegg, R., Reyer, H., Patterns of natural selection on size at metamorphosis in water frogs (2003) Evolution, 57, pp. 872-882; Andre, S.E., Parker, J., Briggs, C.J., Effect of temperature on host response to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infection in the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) (2008) Journal of Wildlife Disease, 44, pp. 716-720; Bar-David, S., Lloyd-Smith, J.O., Getz, W.M., Dynamics and management of infectious disease in colonizing populations (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 1215-1224; Barni, S., Bernocchi, G., Gerzeli, G., Nuclear changes and morphology of the epidermis in the hibernating frog (1987) Tissue and Cell, 19, pp. 817-825; Bedhomme, S., Agnew, P., Sidobre, C., Michalakis, Y., Virulence reaction norms across a food gradient (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 271, pp. 739-744; Bielby, J., Bovero, S., Sotgiu, G., Fatal chytridiomycosis in the Tyrrhenian painted frog (2009) Ecohealth, 6, pp. 27-32; Blanford, S., Thomas, M.B., Pugh, C., Pell, J.K., Temperature checks the Red Queen?.
