The positive aspect in this approach is that there is availability of the above elements in the majority of the planet. Methodology includes a sharp interface concept model and simplified estimation of groundwater recharge using limited climate data. The evaluation shows that the future climate changes would decrease fresh groundwater resources in Central American, South American, South African and Australian regions whereas most of the areas in Asia, except South-East Asia. Combinations of fresh groundwater loss and global population are considered to state the vulnerability of future fresh groundwater supply. Vulnerability assessment shows that South Asia, Central America, North Africa and the Sahara, South Africa and the Middle East countries are highly vulnerable whereas, Northern Europe, Western part of South America, New Zealand and Japan are less vulnerable with respect to future fresh groundwater supply. Further, this paper highlights the necessity Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) practices in these vulnerable coastal regions to ensure the sustainable development in coastal regions.
