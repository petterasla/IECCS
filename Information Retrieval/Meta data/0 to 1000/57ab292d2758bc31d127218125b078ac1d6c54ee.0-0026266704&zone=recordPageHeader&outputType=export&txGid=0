However, until now, geologic evidence of previous ice sheet ""collapses' has been lacking. Sediments that have recently been collected from beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet at Ice Stream B contain direct evidence of ice-free conditions in the West Antarctic interior during certain Cenozoic intervals, both prior to and subsequent to the development of grounded ice sheets in West Antarctica. It is likely that Pliocene and early Pleistocene diatoms were deposited in the West Antarctic interior during certian warm interglacials, but these have been eroded and transported toward the continental shelf edge during repeated ice sheet expansions. The late Pleistocene diatoms from Upstream B were deposited in the West Antarctic interior basins during a marine phase, subsequent to an ice sheet collapse, during at least one late Pleistocene interglacial. This discovery provides an indication of the complex history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and calls into question some previous interpretations of ice sheet stability based on paleoceanographic proxy data. The results of this study may lend credence to the concern that global warming and rising sea levels in a ""greenhouse' earth could lead to collapse of this marine ice sheet during the current interglacial period. -from Author",,"ice grounding; ice sheet history; Ice Stream B; microfossil; Quaternary; sea level; Tertiary; Antarctica, West Antarctica",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026266704
