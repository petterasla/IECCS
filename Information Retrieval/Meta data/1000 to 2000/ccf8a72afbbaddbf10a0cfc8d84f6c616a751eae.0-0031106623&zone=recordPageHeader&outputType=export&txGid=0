The long-range goal of work reported here by John Malone and colleagues on behalf of this Egyptian Ministry of Health-USAID Schistosomiasis Research Project team is to utilize data from sensor systems on board earth-observing satellites to develop more-sensitive disease prediction and -control models. If successful, methods developed may provide a potentially vital capability for use by disease control program managers, particularly in less developed countries, where mapping resources are not well advanced. Longer term, broader basic questions on the interaction of environment and disease in anticipation of predicted global climate change may be addressed. These studies focused on the lower Nile river basin of Egypt. The specific objective was to link data on environmental requirements for propagation and transmission of schistosomiasis with parameters measurable from space.",,"article; egypt; geographic distribution; human; schistosoma mansoni; schistosomiasis; temperature; vector control",,,,,,"Pavlovsky, E.N., (1966) The Natural Nidality of Transmissible Disease, , University of Illinois Press; Webb, B., Hak, S., Program on control of schistosomiasis in Egypt, 1985-1988 (1990) Trans.
