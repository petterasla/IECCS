This study focuses on the evaluation of both the long-term and contemporary trends of peat (carbon) accumulation and its patterns at the southern climatic range of Sphagnum peatlands in western Siberia. Visible and physical features of peat and detailed reconstructions of successional change (or sediment stratigraphies) were analysed at two types of forest-peatland ecotones, which are situated close to each other but differ by topography and composition of their plant communities. Our results suggest that Siberian peatlands exhibit a general trend towards being a carbon sink rather than a source even at or near the southern limit of their distribution. Furthermore, two types of peat accumulation were detected in the study area, namely persistent and intermittent. As opposed to persistent peat accumulation, the intermittent one is characterized by the recurrent degradation of the upper peat layers at the marginal parts of raised bogs. Persistent peat accumulation is the case for the majority of Sphagnum peatlands under current climatic conditions. It might be assumed that more peat will accumulate under the 'increased precipitation' scenarios of global warming, although intermittent peat accumulation could result in the eventual drying that may change peatlands from carbon sinks to carbon sources. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Peat accumulation; Peat stratigraphies; Sphagnum peatlands","Carbon; Ecology; Global warming; Wetlands; Climatic changes; Climatic conditions; Peat accumulation; Peat land; Physical features; Plant communities; Sphagnum peatland; Wetland ecosystem; Peat",,,,,,"Anderson, R.L., Foster, D.R., Motzkin, G., Integrating lateral expansion into models of peatland development in temperate New England (2003) J.
