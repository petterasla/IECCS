Gaseous concentrations and emission rates (ERs) of animal facilities can be affected by the animal production stages, animal species, dietary nutrition, housing types, manure handling schemes, and environmental conditions. This article reports ERs of methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) for a typical, naturally ventilated 24-crate swine farrowing barn located in suburban Beijing, China, that was monitored over one-year period. The measurements were made at bi-monthly intervals (i.e., six measurement episodes total), with each measurement episode covering three consecutive days. Gaseous concentrations were monitored at bi-hourly intervals throughout each 3-day measurement episode. The ventilation rate of the barn was estimated using the CO 2 mass balance method. The GHG concentrations and ERs of the farrowing barn showed diurnal and seasonal variations. Specifically, the concentrations (monthly mean ±SD, mg m -3) ranged from 2.3 (±0.3) to 9.3 (±2) for CH 4, from 0.6 (±0.02) to 1.2 (±0.16) for N 2O, and from 1,370 (±163) to 11,100 (±950) for CO 2, with the higher levels occurring in January and the lower levels in July. The specific ER ranged from 95.2 to 261.8 mg h -1 pig -1 for CH 4, from 6.4 to 12.9 mg h -1 pig -1 for N 2O, and from 122.9 to 127.3 g h -1 pig -1 for CO 2. On the basis of per animal unit (1 AU = 500 kg live body mass), the average daily ERs of the farrowing barn were 9.6 ±3.6 g AU -1 d -1 for CH 4, 0.54 ±0.15 g AU -1 d -1 for N 2O, and 7.5±0.1 kg AU -1 d -1 for CO 2. Results of the GHG ERs from this study differ markedly from the limited literature data collected primarily under European production systems and conditions. Results of the current study provide some baseline data on GHG ERs for swine farrowing operations, thus contributing to development or improvement of GHG emission inventory under the Chinese livestock production conditions. © 2007 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Carbon dioxide; CO 2 balance; Methane; Natural ventilation; Nitrous oxide","Natural ventilation; Nitrous oxide; Gases; Greenhouse effect; biogenic emission; body mass; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; diurnal variation; emission inventory; global warming; greenhouse gas; livestock farming; pig; pollution monitoring; seasonal variation; ventilation; Asia; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Far East; Animalia; Suidae",,,,,,"Baudouin, N., Laitat, M., Vandenheede, M., Desiron, A., Verhagehe, C., Canart, B., Emissions of ammonia, nitrous oxide, methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor in the raising of weaned pigs on straw-based and sawdust-based deep litters (2003) Animal Res, 52 (3), pp. 299-308; Heat and moisture production at animal and house levels.
