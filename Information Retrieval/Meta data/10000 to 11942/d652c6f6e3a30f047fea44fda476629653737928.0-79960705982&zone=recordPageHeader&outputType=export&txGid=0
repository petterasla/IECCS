Coupled with the possibility of future regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, firms and institutions have begun to critically evaluate their own carbon footprint. This paper examines the preferences of stakeholders within a large academic institution for attributes of alternative greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategies. The attributes considered by constituents include: the fuel portfolio mix, effort for conserving energy use, carbon emissions reduction, timeframe for emissions reduction to be achieved and cost. We use a choice experiment technique that enables the examination of greenhouse gas reduction program attribute preferences across three constituent groups. The results show that each of the constituent groups have a positive WTP for carbon emissions reductions and prefer investments in reductions in the shorter- rather than longer-term. The results also suggest differences between the constituent groups in their WTP for types of fuels in the fuel portfolio. Finally, we use the results to examine the welfare implications of different combinations of the policy attributes that coincide with alternative GHG program strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change policy; Fuel portfolio; Stated preferences","Academic institutions; Carbon emissions; Carbon footprint; Choice experiments; Climate change policies; Emissions reduction; Energy use; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas reductions; Impact on the environment; Reduction strategy; Research institutions; Stated preferences; Welfare implications; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Experiments; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Investments; Societies and institutions; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; emission inventory; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy policy; environmental management; fuel consumption; governance approach; greenhouse gas; institutional framework; research work; strategic approach",,,,,,"Alvarez-Farizo, B., Hanley, N., Using conjoint analysis to quantify public preferences over the environmental impacts of wind farms.
