The bubble under consideration is held stationary, except its jittering, by the liquid flowing downward. The mass transfer rate is determined by monitoring the rate of reduction in the equivalent bubble diameter during the initial absorption process. It is found that the interaction with the satellite bubbles generally hampers the dissolution of the primary bubble. The extent of reduction in the dissolution rate increases with the net contacting time during the interaction. When the secondary bubbles interact with the primary bubble mainly outside of its wake, however, the dissolution tends to be enhanced due to induced turbulence in the surrounding liquid flow. A simple theoretical model is developed to simulate the observed results as well as the basic features prevailing in a recently proposed scheme, called the GLAD system, for shallow injection of CO2 gas into seawater.","Bubble deformation; Carbon Dioxide; Gas Absorption; Global Warming; Turbulence Intensity",,,,,,,"Calderbank, P.H., Moo-Young, M.B., The Continuous Phase Heat and Mass Transfer Properties of Dispersions (1961) Chem.
