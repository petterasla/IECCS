We quantified total aboveground dry biomass (TAGB) in undisturbed central Amazonian rainforests, based on detailed estimates of all live and dead plant material within 20 1 ha plots spanning an extensive (ca. 1000 km2) study area. TAGB values in our study area were very high, averaging 397.7 ± 30.0 Mg ha-1. The most important component of aboveground biomass was large (≥10 cm diameter-at-breast-height (DBH)) trees, which comprised 81.9% of TAGB, followed by downed wood debris (7.0%), small trees, saplings, and seedlings (&lt;10 cm DBH; 5.3%), lianas (2.1%), litter (1.9%), snags (1.5%), and stemless palms (0.3%). Among large trees, aboveground biomass was greatest in intermediate-sized (20-50 cm DBH) stems (46.7% of TAGB), with very large (≥60 cm DBH) trees also containing substantial biomass (13.4% of TAGB). There were no significant correlations between large tree biomass and that of any other live or dead biomass component. An analysis based on the variability of our samples suggested that just 3-4 randomly positioned 1 ha plots would be sufficient to provide a reasonable estimate of mean TAGB in a landscape such as ours (with 95% confidence intervals being &lt;10% of the mean). This suggests that efforts to quantify Amazon forest biomass should be extensive rather than intensive; researchers should sample many geographically separate areas with a few plots each, rather than sampling a small number of areas more intensively.","Amazon basin; Biomass; Carbon cycle; Carbon storage; Global warming; Terra-firme forest; Tropical rainforest","Carbon; Ecology; Forestry; Biomass; aboveground biomass; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; global warming; rainforest; Biomass; Ecology; South America",,,,,,"Brown, J.K., (1974) Handbook for Inventorying Downed Woody Material, , USDA Forest Service, Ogden, UT, 25 pp; Brown, S., (1997) Estimating Biomass and Biomass Change of Tropical Forests: A Primer, , Forestry Paper 134, FAO, Rome; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., Biomass of tropical forests: A new estimate based on forest volumes (1984) Science, 223, pp. 1290-1293; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., Biomass estimates for Brazil's Amazonian moist forests (1990) Forest'90: Annals of the First International Symposium on Environmental Studies on Tropical Rain Forests, pp. 46-52. , Manaus, Brazil; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., Aboveground biomass estimates for tropical moist forests of the Brazilian Amazon (1992) Interciencia, 17, pp. 8-18; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., Iverson, L.R., Processes and lands for sequestering carbon in the tropical forest landscape (1992) Water Air Soil Pollut., 64, pp. 139-155; Brown, I.F., Nepstad, D.C., Pires, O., Luz, L.M., Alechandre, A.S., Carbon storage and land-use in extractive reserves, Acre, Brazil (1992) Environ.
