Christy et al. (1998) emphasize that they find a tropospheric cooling trend (-0.046 K decade-1) from 1979 to 1997 with these MSU data, although their analysis of near nadir measurements yields a near zero trend (0.003 K decade-1). Using an independent method to analyze the MSU Ch 2 nadir data separately over global ocean and land, we infer that the temperature trends over both these regions are about 0.11 K decade-1, during the period 1980 to 1996. This result is in better agreement with trend analyses based on conventional surface data.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Radiometers; Temperature measurement; Weather satellites; Microwave sounding unit (MSU); Global warming; global warming; microwave sounding unit",,,,,,"Christy, J.R., Spencer, R.W., Lobl, E.S., Analysis of the merging procedure for the MSU daily temperature time series (1998) J. of Climate; Hansen, J., Wilson, H., Sato, M., Ruedy, R., Shah, K., Hansen, E., Satellite and surface temperature data at odds?
