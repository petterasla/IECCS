This paper reviews current knowledge on yield formation and fruit composition and attempts to identify challenges, opportunities and priorities for research and practice. The present analysis of published information gives a critical appraisal of recent advances concerning variables, especially as they relate to global climate change, that influence yield formation and fruit composition at harvest. Exciting discoveries in fundamental research on the one hand and an increasing focus on outcomes and knowledge transfer on the other are enabling the development and implementation of practical recommendations that will impact grape production in the future. Future research should aim to minimise seasonal variation and optimise the profitable and sustainable production of high-quality fruit for specific uses in the face of climate change, water and labour shortages, shifting consumer preferences and global competition. Better control of product quantity and quality, and differentiation to meet consumer demands and market preferences will enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of the global grape and wine industries. © 2009 Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology Inc.","Climate change; Fruit composition; Grape; Photosynthesis; Salinity; Vineyard management; Vitis; Yield formation","Vitaceae; Vitis",,,,,,"Adams, D.O., Phenolics and ripening in grape berries (2006) American Journal of Enology and Viticulture, 57, pp. 249-256; Agaoglu, Y.S., A study on the differentiation and the development of floral parts in grapes (Vitis vinifera L. var.)
