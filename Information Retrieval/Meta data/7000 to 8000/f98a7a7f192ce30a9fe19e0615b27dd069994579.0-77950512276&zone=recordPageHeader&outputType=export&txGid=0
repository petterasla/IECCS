In accordance with this characteristic, observed changes are indicative of global warming, most pronounced after the 1970s. The skill in simulating a global climate in the 20th century by modern climate models is analyzed. It is shown that climate models satisfactorily reproduce the fields of long-term means, the seasonal cycle, and tendencies of changes in some meteorological objects, whereas their interannual variability (after removal of the trend) is not virtually simulated by the models. An approach to constructing a strategic forecast of forthcoming climatic changes in the Russian Federation for the next decades is discussed, and recommendations on its using are formulated. A variant of a probabilistic strategic forecast of air temperature for the 30-year period of 2008-2037 over Russia is proposed. © 2009 Allerton Press, Inc.",,"20th century; Air temperature; Climatic changes; Global climates; Interannual variability; Russian federation; Seasonal cycle; Surface temperatures; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Weather forecasting; Climate models; air temperature; annual variation; climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; environmental assessment; global warming; probability; surface temperature; Russian Federation",,,,,,"Volodin, E.M., Dianskii, N.A., Simulation of Climate Changes in the 20th to 22nd Centuries with a Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (2006) Fiz.
