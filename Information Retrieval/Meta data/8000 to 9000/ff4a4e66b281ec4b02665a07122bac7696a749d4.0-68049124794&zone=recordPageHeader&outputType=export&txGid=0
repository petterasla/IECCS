Different surveys indicate that the present scenario does not economically justify islanding operation of active distribution networks with RDGs. Anti-islanding protection schemes currently enforce the renewable distributed generators (RDGs) to disconnect immediately and stop generation for grid faults through loss of grid (LOG) protection system. This greatly reduces the benefits of RDG deployment. With rising RDG penetration, much benefit would be lost if the RDGs are not allowed to island only due to conventional operational requirement of utilities. For preventing disconnection of RDGs during LOG, several islanding operation, control and protection schemes are being developed. Technical studies clearly indicate the need to review parts of the ESQCR (Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations) for successful islanded operations. Commercial viability of islanding operation must be assessed in relation to enhancement of power quality, system reliability and supply of potential ancillary services through network support. Demonstration projects under Registered Power Zone and Technical Architecture Projects should be initiated to investigate the usefulness of DG islanding. However these efforts should be compounded with a realistic judgement of the associated technical and economic issues for the development of future power networks. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Global warming; Islanding operation; Loss of grid; Protection coordination; Regulatory policy; Renewable distributed generators","Ancillary service; Anti-islanding protection; Commercial viability; Control and protection; Demonstration project; Distributed generators; Distribution network; Economic issues; Electricity safety; Grid fault; Islanded operation; Islanding; Islanding operation; Islanding operations; Network support; Operational requirements; Power networks; Protection coordination; Protection systems; Regulatory policy; Renewable distributed generators; System reliability; Technical architecture; Technical study; Distributed parameter networks; Distribution of goods; Global warming; Laws and legislation; Mesh generation; Electric equipment protection; active control; development economics; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy policy; global warming; network design; operations technology; project management; quality control; regulatory approach; renewable resource; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,"Jenkins, N., Allan, R., Crossley, P.A., Kirschen, D., Strbac, G., Embedded generation (2000) IEE power and energy series, 31. , The IEE; Bertani, A., Bossi, C., Delfino, B., Lewald, N., Massucco, S., Metten, E., Electrical energy distribution networks: Actual situation and perspectives for distributed generation (2003) Proc. of CIRED, 17th international conference on electricity distribution, , Barcelona, Spain; 12-15 May; Lasseter, R.H., Paigi, P., Microgrid: A conceptual solution (2004) Proc. of power electronics specialists conference (PESC), 6, pp. 4285-4290. , Aachen, Germany; 20-25 June; Hadjsaid, N., Canard, J.F., Dumas, F., Dispersed generation impact on distribution networks (1999) IEEE computer applications in power; CIGRE.
