A technology incorporating the hazard of catastrophic accidents, environmental pollution, and detrimental consequences to health, as well as the open question of managing radioactive waste, is not fit for the future. This turnaround in energy policy marks the beginning of the required entry into the solar age. Changing our energy supply is necessary in the light of the threatening scenarios of global climate change and the finite nature of fossil sources of energy, and needs a clear political dimension. The framework conditions to be established by politics for a sustainable power economy thus rest on three pillars: Expansion of renewable energy sources, improvement of energy efficiency, an ddecentralized structures in energy supply. The success of our national energy policy also offers incentives to other countries and for exports. At EU level, important decisions in the interest of the consumer must be supported.",,"Climate change; Electricity; Energy policy; Radioactive wastes; Renewable energy resources; Energy supplies; Nuclear energy",,,,,,,"Hustedt, M.; Energiepolitische Sprecherin B.B. 90, Platz der Republik 1, 11011 Berlin, Germany",,,,,,,,14315254,,,,"German","ATW Int.
