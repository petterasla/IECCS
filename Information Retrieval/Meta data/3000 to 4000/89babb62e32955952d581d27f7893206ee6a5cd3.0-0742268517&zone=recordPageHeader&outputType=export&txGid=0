The main advantages of solar assisted refrigeration systems concern the reduction of peak loads for electricity utilities, the use of zero ozone depletion impact refrigerants, the decreased primary energy consumption and decreased global warming impact. The main focus of this study is to investigate usage possibility of ejector-absorption cooling system (EACS) in Turkey. This study determines whether or not required heat for generator of EACS can be obtained from solar energy in Turkey. There are two important reasons for the utilisation of EACSs in Turkey. One of them is that the production and use of the CFCs and HCFCs will be phased out in a few years according to Montreal Protocol, adopted in 1987. The other is that Turkey has high solar energy potential because of its location in the northern hemisphere with latitudes 36-42°N and longitudes 26-45°E and the yearly average solar radiation is 3.6 kWh/m2 day, and the total yearly radiation period is ∼2610 h. For analysis, 17 cities were selected in different regions of Turkey in which the radiation data and sunshine duration information have been collected since 2000. By using the meteorological data, it was aimed that required optimum collector surface area for maximum coefficient of performance (COPmax) conditions of EACSs operated with aqua-ammonia was defined. In addition, required minimum energy for auxiliary heater was calculated so that the system can be used throughout the year. It was found that the heat gain factor (HGF) varies in the range from 0.5 to 2.68 for the all the seasons in the selected cities. The maximum HGF of about 2.68 was obtained for Van in July. This study shows that there is a great potential for utilisation of solar cooling system for domestic heating/cooling applications in Turkey. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
