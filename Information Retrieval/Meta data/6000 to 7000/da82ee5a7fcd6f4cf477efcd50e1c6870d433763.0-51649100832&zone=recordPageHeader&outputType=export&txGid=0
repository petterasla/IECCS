Knowledge of cirrus properties is crucial for studying the radiation budget and climate change. Thus studies of the optical, microphysical, and physical properties of cirrus have become the popular issue. The optical properties of cirrus at 0.865 μm are studied. And the reflectance and polarized reflectance are evaluated with the adding-doubling method by solving the vector radiative transfer model, and the sensitivity of reflectance and polarized reflectance to cirrus optical parameters and surface albedo are evaluated. The results indicate that the polarized reflectance over a large range of scattering angles can show the information of cirrus properties. Based on the studies of the sensitivity, the basic theory of using the remote sensing data of multi-angular polarized measurements to retrieve the properties of cirrus is proposed.","Cirrus clouds microphysical parameter; Cirrus clouds optical properties; Multi-angular polarized radiance; Vector radiative transfer model",,,,,,,,"Cheng, T.-H.; State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Institute of Remote Sensing Applications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China",,,,,,,,10003290,,WLHPA,,"Chinese","Wuli Xuebao",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-51649100832
