Methane gas hydrate reservoirs are located within permafrost or sediment underlying permafrost or below the ocean floor. The possibility of methane hydrate decomposition due to global warming is investigated by using a mathematical model based on heat conduction in single and composite media. Phase change within permafrost is taken into account. The temperature profiles and the critical time required for the onset of methane hydrate decomposition were computed and found to depend on the global warming scenario, the thermophysical properties of the earth and the required driving force for hydrate decomposition. The temperature at the top of a typical methane hydrate zone will begin to rise within the next 100 yr under a global temperature rise of 0.08°C/yr. However, methane hydrate decomposition will require a finite driving force and thus will occur later. Under a global temperature rise of 0.006°C/yr, these phenomena will be substantially delayed. © 1993.",,"Global Warming; Methane; Modelling-Mathematical; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Greenhouse effect; Heat conduction; Mathematical models; Methane; Permafrost; Phase transitions; Pyrolysis; Sediments; Thermal effects; Global warming; Gas hydrates",,,,,,"Apel, (1987) Principles of Ocean Physics, pp. 123-159. , Academic Press, New York; Bell, Methane hydrate and the carbon dioxide question (1982) Carbon Dioxide Review, pp. 401-406. , W.C.
