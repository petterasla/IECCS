To confirm and add credibility to the study, uncertainty analysis was conducted. Results showed the impact generated from respiratory inorganics, terrestrial ecotoxicity, global warming, and non-renewable energy categories had an important contribution to overall environmental impact, due to energy, clinker, and limestone production stages. Also, uncertainty analysis results showed the technology of sewage sludge as secondary raw material in cement production had little or no effect on changing the overall environmental potential impact generated from general cement production. Accordingly, using the technology of sewage sludge as secondary raw material in cement production is a good choice for reducing the pressure on the environment from dramatically increased sludge disposal. In addition, increasing electricity recovery rate, choosing natural gas fired electricity generation technology, and optimizing the raw material consumption in clinker production are highly recommended to reduce the adverse effects on the environment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Adverse effect; Cement production; Clinker production; Ecotoxicity; Electricity recovery; Environmental assessment; Gas-fired electricity generation; Inorganics; Life-cycle assessments; Non-renewable energy; Potential impacts; Production stage; Raw material consumption; Secondary Raw Materials; Cements; Electric generators; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Global warming; Life cycle; Raw materials; Sewage sludge; Sludge disposal; Uncertainty analysis; carcinogen; cement; inorganic compound; limestone; cement; ecotoxicology; electricity generation; environmental assessment; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; optimization; sewage; sludge; technology adoption; uncertainty analysis; article; cement industry; China; controlled study; ecotoxicity; electricity; energy; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; industrial sludge; life cycle assessment; priority journal; process technology; sludge disposal; China; Construction Materials; Environment; Models, Theoretical; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; China",,"limestone, 1317-65-3; Sewage",,,,"Curran, M.A., The status of life-cycle assessment as an environmental management tool (2004) Environmental Progress, 23, pp. 277-283; Dong, S., Li, X., Zhang, Z., Life cycle assessment of new dry cement production process (2008) Environment Protection, 396, pp. 39-42. , (in Chinese); Ecoinvent Centre, Ecoinvent data v2.0 Final Reports Ecoinvent 2000 No.1-15, Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories, Dubendorf, CH (2007), http://www.ecoinvent.ch, Availble from:Engin, T., Ari, V., Energy auditing and recovery for dry type cement rotary kiln systems: a case study (2005) Energy Conversion and Management, 46, pp. 551-562; EU BREF, Draft Reference Document on Best Available Techniques in the Cement, Lime and Magnesium Oxide Manufacturing Industries (2009), http://www.ippc-russia.org, Available from:Goedkoop, M., Spriensma, R., The Eco-Indicator 99: A damage orientated method for life cycle impact assessment, VROM, Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment, Netherlands (2000)Guinée, J.B., Gorrée, M., Heijungs, R., Huppes, G., Kleijin, R., de Koning, A., van Oers, L., Weidema, B.P., Life cycle assessment.
