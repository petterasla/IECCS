These five sources of external costs by vehicle make and model were estimated for the top-selling passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the US. Among these external costs, those associated with crashes and congestion are estimated to be the most practically significant. When crash costs are included, the worst offenders (in terms of highest external costs) were found to be pickups. If crash costs are removed from the comparisons, the worst offenders tend to be four pickups and a very large SUV: the Ford F-350 and F-250, Chevrolet Silverado 3500, Dodge Ram 3500, and Hummer H2, respectively. Regardless of how the costs are estimated, they are considerable in magnitude, and nearly on par with vehicle purchase prices. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
