The four integrations are: a control with constant levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a second integration in which an estimate of the combined radiative forcing of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols over the period 1765-2065 is used to force the model, and a third (fourth) integration in which atmospheric CO2 increases at the rate of 1% per year to double (quadruple) its initial value, and is held constant thereafter. While the spatial patterns of the changes in Heat Index are largely determined by the changes in surface air temperature, increases in atmospheric moisture can substantially amplify the changes in Heat Index over regions which are warm and humid in the Control integration. The regions most prone to this effect include humid regions of the Tropics and summer hemisphere extra-tropics, including the southeastern United States, India, southeast Asia and northern Australia.",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; global warming",,,,,,"Gaffen, D.J., Ross, R.J., Increased Summertime Heat Stress in the U.S. (1998) Nature, 396, pp. 529-530; Haywood, J.M., Stouffer, R.J., Wetherald, R.T., Manabe, S., Ramaswamy, V., Transient Response of a Coupled Model to Estimated Changes in Greenhouse Gas and Sulfate Concentrations (1997) Geophys.
