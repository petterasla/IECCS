In this study, the potential effects of specific levels of atmospheric warming on water-year streamflow in the Colorado River basin are evaluated using a water-balance model, and the results are analyzed within the context of a multi-century tree-ring reconstruction (1490-1998) of streamflow for the basin. The results indicate that if future warming occurs in the basin and is not accompanied by increased precipitation, then the basin is likely to experience periods of water supply shortages more severe than those inferred from the longterm historical tree-ring reconstruction. Furthermore, the modeling results suggest that future warming would increase the likelihood of failure to meet the water allocation requirements of the Colorado River Compact.",,"Global warming; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Stream flow; Water supply; Tree-ring reconstruction; Water supply shortage; Water-balance model; Drought; drought; global warming; hydrological cycle; precipitation assessment; reconstruction; sustainability; tree ring; water budget; water supply; Colorado Basin; North America",,,,,,"Christensen, N., Lettenmaier, D.P., A multimodel ensemble approach to assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrology and water resources of the Colorado River basin (2006) Hydrol.
