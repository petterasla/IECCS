It is also a good solvent replacement for CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons), HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) and chlorinated solvents because they have a short atmospheric lifetime and low global warming potential. Based upon their properties, hydrofluoro ethers are ideally suited for the demands of the electronics industry. However, the electronics industry requires these solvents to have high purity, especially in the area of residual anions. This paper will present information on an extraction methodology for the transfer of anions from the hydrofluoro ether to water. Then, an analytical method utilizing ion chromatography that is capable of detection of 10 anions (fluoride, acetate, formate, chloride, nitrite, bromide, nitrate, sulfate, oxalate, and phosphate) in the part per billion level will be demonstrated. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
