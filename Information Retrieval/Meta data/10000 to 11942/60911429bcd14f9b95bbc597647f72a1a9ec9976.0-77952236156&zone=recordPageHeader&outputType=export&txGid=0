Rn and the rate of photosynthetic electron transport (J) are significantly higher in plants grown at 19 versus 27°C; Rn is not affected by the native thermal habitat. By contrast, both the maximum capacity of rubisco (Vcmax) and A are relatively insensitive to growth temperature, but both parameters are slightly higher in plants from cool habitats. A is limited by rubisco capacity from 17-37°C regardless of growth temperature, and there is little evidence for an electron-transport limitation. Stomatal conductance (gs) is higher in warm-grown plants, but declines with increasing measurement temperature from 17 to 37°C, regardless of growth temperature. The mesophyll conductance (gm) is relatively temperature insensitive below 25°C, but gm declines at 37°C in cool-grown plants. Plants acclimated to cool temperatures have increased Rn/A, but this response does not differ between warm- and cool-adapted populations. Primary carbon metabolism clearly acclimates to growth temperature in P. balsamifera, but the ecotypic differences in A suggest that global warming scenarios might affect populations at the northern and southern edges of the boreal forest in different ways. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acclimation; Gas exchange; Homeostasis; Mesophyll conductance","carbon dioxide; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; acclimatization; adaptation; article; aspen; cell respiration; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant stoma; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Respiration; Photosynthesis; Plant Stomata; Populus; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Temperature; Populus balsamifera",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase, 9027-23-0; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase, 4.1.1.39",,,,"Atkin, O.K., Tjoelker, M.G., Thermal acclimation and the dynamic response of plant respiration to temperature (2003) Trend Plant Sci, 8, pp. 343-351; Atkin, O.K., Bruhn, D., Hurry, V.M., Tjoelker, M.G., The hot and the cold: Unravelling the variable response of plant respiration to temperature (2005) Funct Plant Biol, 32, pp. 87-105; Badger, M.R., Björkman, O., Armond, P.A., An analysis of photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants-temperature acclimation in the desert evergreen Nerium oleander L (1982) Plant Cell Environ, 5, pp. 85-99; Bernacchi, C.J., Portis, A.R., Nakano, H., von Caemmerer, S., Long, S.P., Temperature response of mesophyll conductance.
