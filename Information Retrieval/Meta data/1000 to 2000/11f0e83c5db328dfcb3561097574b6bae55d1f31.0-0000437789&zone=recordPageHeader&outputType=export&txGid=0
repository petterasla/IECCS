In this study, a growth model is proposed for CO2 hydrate layers. In addition, an estimation is shown for the CO2 concentration profile, the growth rate of the layer, and its thickness in the quasi-steady state. The simulation results indicate that the hydrate layer diminishes CO2 dissolution from the storage pool into the upper sea. This growth process is extremely sensitive to the density difference between the CO2 hydrate particles and its environmental liquid.","CO2 Hydrate; CO2 Storage; Global Warming; Multiphase Flow; Numerical Simulation",,,,,,,"Angus, S., Armstrong, B., De Reuck, K.M., (1975) International Thermodynamic Table of the Fluid State, , Carbon Dioxide, Pergamon, Oxford, England; Asai, K., Ozaki, M., Murakami, N., Fujioka, Y., Transportation on System for CO2 into Deep Sea (1st report) (1991) Nihon Zosengakkai Ronbunshu, 170, pp. 369-377; Aya, I., Yamane, K., Yamada, N., (1992) Stability of Clathrate-Hydrate of Carbon Dioxide in Highly Pressurized Water, 215 HTD-VOL, pp. 17-22. , ASME; Bird, R.B., Stewart, W.E., Lightfoot, E., (1960) Transport Phenomena, pp. 199-200. , John Wiley & Sons, New York, USA; Drange, H., Alendal, G., Haugan, P.M., A Bottom Gravity Current Model for CO2-Enriched Seawater (1993) Energy Convers.
