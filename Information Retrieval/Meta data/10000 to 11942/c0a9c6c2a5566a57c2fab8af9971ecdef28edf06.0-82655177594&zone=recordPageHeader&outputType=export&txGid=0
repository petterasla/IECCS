Through the use of concrete-anchored posts, improved software, overhead wires, extensive grounding, and monitoring with a thermal camera, the technology was safely and reliably extended to paddy rice fields. The system maintained canopy temperature increases within 0.5°C of daytime and nighttime set-point differences of 1.3 and 2.7°C 67% of the time. © 2011 Rehmani et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Canopy temperature; Climate change; Ecosystem warming; Global change; Infrared heating; Plant-climate interactions; Rice; Yangtze river valley","Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"State of the world population 2010 (2010), http://www.unfpa.org/public/swp2010, UNFP, United Nations Population FundKrishnan, P., Ramakrishnan, B., Reddy, K.R., Reddy, V.R., High-Temperature Effects on Rice Growth, Yield, and Grain Quality (2011) Advances in Agronomy, 111, pp. 87-206. , Academic Press, Donald LS; Fischer, K.S., Challenges for rice reseach in Asia (1998) Sustainability of rice in the global food system, pp. 95-98. , International Rice Research Institute, Dowling NG, Greenfield SM, Fischer KS; Parmesan, C., Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change (2006) Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst, 37, pp. 637-669; Summary for Policymakers.
