As a result, there has been enormous increase in the use of FTIR techniques for a variety of qualitative and quantitative chemical measurements. These methods offer the possibility of fully automated real-time quantitation of many analytes; therefore FTIR has great potential as an analytical tool. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA) has developed protocol methods for emissions monitoring using both extractive and open-path FTIR measurements. Depending upon the analyte, the experimental conditions and the analyte matrix, approximately 100 of the hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in the 1990 U.S.EPA Clean Air Act amendment (CAAA) can be measured. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a program to provide quality-assured infrared absorption coefficient data based on NIST prepared primary gas standards. Currently, absorption coefficient data has been acquired for approximately 20 of the HAPs. For each compound, the absorption coefficient spectrum was calculated using nine transmittance spectra at 0.12 cm-1 resolution and the Beer's law relationship. The uncertainties in the absorption coefficient data were estimated from the linear regressions of the transmittance data and considerations of other error sources such as the nonlinear detector response. For absorption coefficient values greater than 1 × 104 μmol/mol)-1 m-1 the average relative expanded uncertainty is 2.2 %. This quantitative infrared database is currently an ongoing project at NIST. Additional spectra will be added to the database as they are acquired. Our current plans include continued data acquisition of the compounds listed in the CAAA, as well as the compounds that contribute to global warming and ozone depletion.","Air pollutants; Database; Gas standards; Infrared spectrometer",,,,,,,"Henry, C., (1998) Analytical Chemistry News & Features, pp. 273A. , April 1; (Proposed) test method 320 measurement of vapor phase organic and inorganic emissions by extractive fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Federal Register, (63 PART). , Appendix A; Compendium Method TO-16, Long-Path Open-Path Fourier Transform Infrared Monitoring of Atmospheric Gases, , EPA Contract 68-D5-0049, NERL, U.S.EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC; Federal Clean Air Act, Title II, pp. 101-549. , Public Law; Richardson R.L., Jr., Griffiths, P.R., (1998) Appl.
