Population is increasing, albeit at a decreasing rate. Spatially, the population is becoming more and more concentrated as the rates and level of urbanization increase, Economic growth has remained consistently high. The combined effect of population dynamics and economic development are having a noticeable imprint on the environment in the form of increased waste generation. Poor waste management poses a real threat to environmental sustainability in general and climate change in particular because of inadequate technology, weak institutional mechanisms to enforce regulations, and low levels of sensitization among the public to deal with the problem. Mitigation measures are suggested to minimize the negative effects of waste management on climate change.","Botswana; Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Waste management","Climate change; Economics; Environmental impact; Urbanization; Waste management; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; urbanization; waste management; Botswana; climate change; documentation; economic aspect; geographic distribution; government; policy; pollution; population distribution; population research; population size; review; urbanization; waste management; article; climate; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; human; population dynamics; sewage; theoretical model; waste disposal; Botswana; Botswana; Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Population Dynamics; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal, Fluid",,,,,,"Ajaegbu, H.I., Population and environment quality (1985) Population Education Monograph 10, , Nigeria Education Research and Development Council, Lagos; Commoner, B., Rapid population growth and environmental stress (1991) International Journal of Health Services, 21, pp. 199-227; (2000) Environmental Statistics, , Government Printer, Gaborone; (2001) Population and Housing Census: Preliminary Results Brief, , Government Printer, Gaborone; Ehrlich, P.R., Holdren, J.P., Impact of population growth (1971) Science, 171, pp. 1212-1217; (1996) 1996 Annual Report, , Department of Health, Gaborone; Gwebu, T.D., (1997) Measures Pertaining to Urban Environmental Health Problems in Africa: The Case of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, , Economic Commission for Africa, Addis Ababa; Gwebu, T.D., Energy sector policies in Botswana and their implications for global climate change (2002) Geojournal, , in press; Hagos, A., (1997) Measures Pertaining to Urban Environmental Health Problems in Africa: The Case of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, , Economic Commission for Africa, Addis Ababa; (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change.
