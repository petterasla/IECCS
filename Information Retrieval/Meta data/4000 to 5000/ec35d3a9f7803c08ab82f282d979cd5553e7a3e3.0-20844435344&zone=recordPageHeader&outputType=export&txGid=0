In order to assess these impacts, a semi-distributed monthly water balance model was proposed and developed to simulate and predict the hydrological processes in the middle and lower Yellow River basin. GIS techniques were used as a tool to analyze topography, river networks, land-use, human activities, vegetation, and soil characteristics. The model parameters were calibrated in 35 gauged sub-basins in the middle Yellow River, and then the relationships between the model parameters and the basin physical characteristics were established. A parameterization scheme was developed in which the model parameters were estimated for each grid element by regression and optimization methods. Based on the different outputs of general circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs), the sensitivities to global warming of hydrology and water resources for the Yellow River basin were studied. The proposed models are capable of producing both the magnitude and timing of runoff and water resources conditions. The runoffs are found to be very sensitive to temperature increases and rainfall decreases. Results of the study also indicated that runoff is more sensitive to variation in precipitation than to increase in temperature. The additional uncertainty of climate change has posed a challenge to the existing water resources management practices, and the integration of water resources management will be necessary to enhance the water use efficiency in the Yellow River basin. © 2005 International Water Resources Association.","Climate change; GIS; Impact study; Runoff simulation; Water balance model",,,,,,,"Atkinson, S.E., Woods, R.A., Sivapalan, M., Climate and landscape controls on water balance model complexity over time scales (2002) Water Resources Research, 38 (12), p. 1487; Donald, H.B., Boorman, D.B., Estimation of hydrological parameters at ungauged catchments (1993) Journal of Hydrology, 143, pp. 429-454; Dooge, J.C.I., Bruen, M., Parmentier, B., Asimple model for estimating the sensitivity of runoff to long-term changes in precipitation without a change in vegetation (1999) Advances in Water Resources, 23, pp. 153-163; Dunn, S.M., Lilly, A., Investigating the relationship between a soils classification and the spatial parameters of a conceptual catchment-scale hydrological model (2001) Journal of Hydrology, 252, pp. 157-173; Gleick, P.H., The development and testing of a water balance model for climate impact assessment: Modeling the Sacramento basin (1987) Water Resources Research, 23 (6), pp. 1049-1061; Guo, S., Wang, G., Monthly water balance model in the Yellow River basin (1994) Renmin Huanghe, 112, pp. 13-16. , in Chinese; Guo, S., Impact of climate change on hydrological balance and water resource systems in the Dongjiang Basin, China (1995) Modeling and Management of Sustainable Basin-Scale Water Resource, , Proceedings of Boulder Symposium 1995.
