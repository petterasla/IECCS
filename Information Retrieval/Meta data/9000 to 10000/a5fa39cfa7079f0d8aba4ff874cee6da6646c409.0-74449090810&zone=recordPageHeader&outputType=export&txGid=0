But, in the present context of global climate change, there is a need to consider potential long-term effects of natal conditions to better understand and predict the consequences of these changes on population dynamics. The environmental conditions affecting offspring during their early development may determine their lifetime reproductive performance, and therefore the number of recruits produced by a cohort. In this study, we attempted to link recruitment to natal and recent (previous year) conditions in the long-lived black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophrys) at Kerguelen Islands. The environmental variability was described using both climatic variables over breeding (sea surface temperature anomaly) and non-breeding grounds (Southern Oscillation index), and variables related to the colony (breeding success and colony size). Immature survival was linked to the breeding success of the colony in the year of birth, which was expected to reflect the average seasonal parental investment. At the cohort level, this initial mortality event may act as a selective filter shaping the number, and presumably the quality (breeding frequency, breeding success probability), of the individuals that recruit into the breeding population. The decision to start breeding was strongly structured by the age of the individuals and adjusted according to recent conditions. An effect of natal conditions was not detected on this parameter, supporting the selection hypothesis. Recruitment, as a whole, was thus influenced by a combination of long- and short-term environmental impacts. Our results highlight the complexity of the influence of environmental factors on such long-lived species, due to the time-lag (associated with a delayed maturity) between the impact of natal conditions on individuals and their repercussion on the breeding population. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Black-browed albatross; Breeding decision; Environmental variability; Immature survival; Natal conditions","sea water; breeding population; climate change; developmental stage; environmental impact; life history trait; long-term change; recruitment (population dynamics); reproductive behavior; reproductive strategy; seabird; survival; age; animal; article; bird; breeding; chemistry; climate; female; growth, development and aging; male; nesting; physiology; population dynamics; sexual behavior; temperature; Age Factors; Animals; Birds; Breeding; Climate; Female; Male; Nesting Behavior; Population Dynamics; Seawater; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Temperature; French Southern Territories; Kerguelen Islands; Aves; Diomedea melanophris; Mammalia",,,,,,"Blain, S., Tréguer, P., Belviso, S., Bucciarelli, E., Denis, M., Desabre, M., Fiala, M., Razouls, S., A biogeochemical study of the island mass effect in the context of the iron hypothesis: Kerguelen Islands, Southern Ocean (2001) Deep Sea Res, 48, pp. 163-187; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (1998) Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , New York: Springer; Cam, E., Monnat, J.-Y., Apparent inferiority of first-time breeders in the kittiwake: The role of heterogeneity among age class (2000) J Anim Ecol, 69, pp. 380-394; Cam, E., Monnat, J.-Y., Hines, J.E., Long-term fitness consequences of early conditions in the kittiwake (2003) J Anim Ecol, 72, pp. 411-424; Cam, E., Cooch, E.G., Monnat, J.-Y., Earlier recruitment or earlier death?
