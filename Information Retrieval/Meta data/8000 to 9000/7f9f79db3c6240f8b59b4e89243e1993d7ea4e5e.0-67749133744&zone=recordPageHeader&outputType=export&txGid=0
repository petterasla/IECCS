Identification of sediment fluxes and sources over Holocene timescales can both enable understanding of the relative impacts of these forcings and provide perspective on recent sediment fluxes. Here we present a ∼ 5500 yr record of sediment fluxes and sources from Lake Bassenthwaite in the English Lake District, utilizing magnetic measurements and fuzzy clustering, coupled with independent pollen and archaeological records, to identify the timing and impact of catchment disturbance. This record shows that recent sediment flux increases (ie, within the last 150 years) are unprecedented in scale throughout the midĝ€""late Holocene and appear to be in response to specific human changes occurring within the catchment. Earlier episodes of human activity, from the mid Holocene onwards, show no link with increased lake sediment fluxes, indicating either limited catchment impact and/or 'buffering' through within-catchment sediment storage. Increasingly intensive land use and reduction of sediment storage through revetment construction on a key inflow, Newlands Beck, have resulted in 3 - increases in lake sediment flux. These data may be significant for other upland temperate areas, as increasing land-use pressures and reduced sediment storage capacity may not only increase contemporary sediment flux, but increase sensitivity to predicted increases in rainfall and storminess as a result of global climate change. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Catchment; Climate change; England; Environmental magnetism; Holocene; Lake; Lake District.; Magnetic susceptibility; Pollen; Sediment dynamics; Sediment tracing","catchment; climate effect; Holocene; human activity; lacustrine deposit; land use; palynology; sediment transport; Bassenthwaite; Cumbria; England; Eurasia; Europe; Lake District; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,"Appleby, P.G., Oldfield, F., The calculation of lead-210 dates assuming a constant rate of supply of unsupported 210Pb to the sediment (1978) Catena, 5, pp. 1-8; (2008) Archaeology Data Service 2008: Arc Search Catalogue, , http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/, University of York; Bennion, H., Monteith, D., Appleby, P., Temporal and geographical variation in lake trophic status in the English Lake District: Evidence from (sub)fossil diatoms and aquatic macrophytes (2000) Freshwater Biology, 45, pp. 394-412; Birks, H.J.B., Numerical Zonation, Comparison and Correlation of Quaternary Pollen-stratigraphical Data (1986) Handbook of Holocene Palaeoecology and Palaeohydrology, pp. 743-74. , Berglund, B.E., editor, Blackburn Press; Bradshaw, R., Thompson, R., The use of magnetic measurements to investigate the mineralogy of Icelandic lake-sediments and to study catchment processes (1985) Boreas, 14, pp. 203-15; Bronk Ramsey, C., Improving the resolution of radiocarbon dating by statistical analysis The Bible and radiocarbon dating: Archaeology, text and science (2005) Equinox, pp. 57-64; Chambers, F.M., Barber, K.E., Maddy, D., Brew, J., A 5500-year proxy-climate and vegetation record from blanket mire at Talla Moss, Borders, Scotland (1997) The Holocene, 7, pp. 391-99; Chiverrell, R.C., Past and future perspectives upon landscape instability in Cumbria, northwest England (2006) Regional Environmental Change, 6, pp. 101-14; Collins, A.L., Walling, D.E., Selecting fingerprint properties for discriminating potential suspended sediment sources in river basins (2002) Journal of Hydrology, 261, pp. 218-44; Coulthard, T.J., MacKlin, M.G., How sensitive are river systems to climate and land-use changes?
