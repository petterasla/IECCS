In all cases where the differences were significant the larvae occurred earlier in 1989 than in previous years. Zoeae of Atelecyclus rotundatus were found in the Southern Bight in the spring. The winter of 1988-1989 was exceptionally mild with air temperatures over Great Britain 2-3 °C above average and positive temperature anomalies persisted through the year. The sea surface temperatures in the North Sea were also mainly higher than usual. The events were treated as a ""natural experiment"" to examine effects of the high temperatures on seasonal cycles of decapod larval production and the implications of these effects for marine communities with reference to predicted global warming. The relationships between timing of occurrence of the larvae in the plankton and parameters of sea temperatures were generally consistent with previous results from studies of geographical variations, and possible causal mechanisms are discussed in the light of the 1989 data. © 1993.","Climate; Decapoda; Distributions; Global warming; Larvae; North Sea; Seasonal cycle","climate; crustacean larvae; decapod; seasonal cycles; seasonality; North Sea; Atelecyclus rotundatus",,,,,,"Adema, Creutzberg, Van Noort, Notes on the occurrence of some poorly known Decapoda (Crustacea) in the southern North Sea (1982) Zool.
