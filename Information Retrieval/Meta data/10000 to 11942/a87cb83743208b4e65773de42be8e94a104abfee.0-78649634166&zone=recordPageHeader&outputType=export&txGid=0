This paper complements the large-scale results by examining a long time-series of high-quality temperature data from the Secular Meteorological Station in Potsdam, where observation records over the last 117 years, i. e., from January 1893 are available. Tendencies of change in seasonal temperature-related climate extremes are demonstrated. ""Cold"" extremes have become less frequent and less severe than in the past, while ""warm"" extremes have become more frequent and more severe. Moreover, the interval of the occurrence of frost has been decreasing, while the interval of the occurrence of hot days has been increasing. However, many changes are not statistically significant, since the variability of temperature indices at the Potsdam station has been very strong. © 2010 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.","climate change; climate variability; seasonality; temperature extremes","Climate variability; High quality; Meteorological station; Potsdam; Seasonal temperature; Seasonality; Temperature data; temperature extremes; Temperature index; Global warming; Climatology; climate change; climate variation; dam; global warming; observational method; temperature effect; time series analysis; Brandenburg; Germany; Potsdam",,,,,,"Brohan, P., Kennedy, J.J., Harris, I., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, P.D., Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: A new data set from 1850 (2006) J.
