Scientists are optimistic that with appropriate management soils can function as sinks for C and contribute to CO2 abatement strategies. The objective of this study was to determine if soil C can be increased using an annual legume green manure (GM) as partial fallow replacement in a fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-wheat (F-W-W) rotation in the Brown soil zone of Saskatchewan. In 1995 and 1996 we measured soil C fluxes in all phases of F-W-W and GM-W-W rotations, which were two of the treatments in an experiment initiated in 1987 on a medium-textured Orthic Brown Chernozem. The GM, Indianhead black lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) was estimated to add 1800 and 1400 kg C ha-1 in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Annual inputs of C in residues of the wheat crops were two to three times those of GM. Comparison of CO2 emissions from GM with those from the fallow phase of the F-W-W system suggested that GM largely decomposed in the interval between incorporation (mid-July) and freeze-up in fall. Fluxes of CO2 from the wheat phases of GM-W-W closely matched those from the corresponding phases of F-W-W, confirming that there was little carryover of undecomposed GM to the following growing season. Our results suggest that, in a 3-yr rotation, partial fallow replacement with legume GM may have only a minor impact on C sequestration because the increase in C inputs is relatively small (∼ 25% in this study) and GM decomposes rapidly in the soil due to its narrow C:N ratio (12-13). Green manuring may, however, play a more significant role in enhancing soil C levels in a F-W system, where relatively large increases in C inputs could be achieved using currently-available legume species.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon sequestration; Crop residue decomposition; Lentil; Summerfallow; Wheat","carbon flux; fallow; legume; manure; semiarid region; soil carbon; Canada; Lens culinaris; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Akinremi, O.O., McGinn, S.M., McLean, H.D.J., Effects of soil temperature on soil respiration in barley and fallow plots (1999) Can.
