It has also been severely criticized. We show how the limit emerged out of a marginal remark in an early paper about climate policy and distinguish three possible views of it. The catastrophe view sees it as the threshold separating a domain of safety from a domain of catastrophe. The cost-benefit view sees it as a strategy to optimize the relation between the costs and benefits of climate policy. The focal point view sees it as a solution to a complex coordination problem. We argue that the focal point view is the most appropriate. It leads to an emphasis on implementing effective steps toward a near-zero emissions economy, without panicking in the face of a possible temporary overshooting. After several decades of practical experiences, the focal point may or may not be redefined on the basis of knowledge gathered thanks to these experiences. © 2010 The Author(s).","2 degree limit; Climate policy; Costbenefit analysis; Dangerous anthropogenic interference; Tipping points",,,,,,,"Alley, R., Marotzke, J., Nordjaus, W., Overpeck, J., Peteet, D., Pielke, R., Pierrehumbert, R., Wallace, J., Abrupt climate change (2003) Science, 299, pp. 2005-2010; Archer, C.L., Jacobson, M.Z., Supplying baseload power and reducing transmission requirements by interconnecting wind farms (2007) J Appl Meteorol Climatol, 46, pp. 1701-1717; Arrow, K.J., A difficulty in the concept of social welfare (1950) J Polit Econ, 58, pp. 328-346; Arrow, K.J., Cropper, M.L., Eads, G.C., Hahn, R.W., Lave, L.B., Noll, R.G., Portney, P.R., Stavins, R.N., Is there a role for benefit-cost analysis in environmental, health and safety regulation?
