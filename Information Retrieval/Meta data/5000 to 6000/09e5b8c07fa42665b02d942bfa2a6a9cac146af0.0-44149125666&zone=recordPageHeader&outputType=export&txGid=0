This, paper aims to understand the perceptions of local coastal managers in California of current, inundation-related risks, the added risks from climate change, and vulnerability to the, growing coastal problems. We also explore the extent to which coastal managers are beginning, to think about and tackle these increasing management challenges., Survey results presented here suggest that inundation already creates critical management, challenges in California, but other, non-inundation-related coastal problems also vie, for managers' attention. Despite high awareness of global warming and moderately good, understanding of potential impacts of climate change on coastal areas, currently pressing, issues and limited staff time and resources constrain their ability to begin dealing with the, growing risks from sea-level rise. The sobering conclusion is that California is inadequately, preparing for the impacts of climate change on coastal areas at this time. Local government, will need substantial support from state and federal agencies if the level of preparedness for, climate change and other inundation-related risks is to be elevated in the future.",,"California; Coastal area; Federal agency; Local government; Management challenges; Open ocean; Potential impacts; Related risk; San Francisco Bay; Sea level rise; Staff time; Coastal zones; Global warming; Managers; Ocean currents; Quality assurance; Surveys; Risk perception",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Clark, P.U., Ice-sheet and sea-level changes (2005) Science, 310, pp. 456-460; Burby, R.J., Nelson, A.C., Local government and public adaptation to sea-level rise (1991) J Urban Plan D., 117 (4), pp. 140-153; (2001) Overview of Sea Level Rise and Some Implications for Coastal California, p. 32. , California Coastal Commission.
