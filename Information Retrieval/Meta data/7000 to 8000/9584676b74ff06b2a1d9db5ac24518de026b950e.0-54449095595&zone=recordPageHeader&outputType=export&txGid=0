Two types of elements are selected for this study, namely, tile and vinyl tile. Environmental burdens associated with these elements are analyzed in terms of embodied energy and environmental impacts that are relevant to Sri Lanka, such as global warming, acidification and nutrient enrichment. Economic analysis is based on market prices and affordability of materials. Factors considered for the social analysis are thermal comfort, good interior (aesthetics), ability to construct fast, strength and durability. It was found that tile elements are superior to vinyl tile elements on environmental scores if processes of complete life cycle of these elements are taken into account. On social score also, tile elements (104.8) are better than vinyl tile elements (51.15). But on economic score, vinyl tile elements are better. These scores are presented in a matrix which will help in selecting sustainable floor coverings for buildings. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
