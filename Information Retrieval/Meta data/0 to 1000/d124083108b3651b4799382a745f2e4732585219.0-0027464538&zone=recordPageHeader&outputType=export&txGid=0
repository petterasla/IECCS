Subsurface temperature anomalies are well correlated (~0.58) with the air temperature anomalies at Sitka, Alaska; hence the coastal air temperatures can be used as a proxy data set to extend the ocean temperature time series back to 1828. Up to 30% of the low-frequency variance can be accounted for with the 18.6-year nodal signal. Additionally, spectral analysis of these air temperature variations indicates a significant low-frequency peak in the range of the 18.6-year signal. Similar low-frequency signals have been reported for Hudson Bay air temperatures since 1700, for sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic from 1876 to 1939, and for sea level in the high-latitude southern hemisphere. -from Author",,"climate change; high latitude; interdecadal climate variations; modal 18.6 year tide; ocean variability; oceanic variability; sea surface temperature; temperature anomaly; tidal forcing; Atlantic, (North); USA, Alaska, Sitka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027464538
