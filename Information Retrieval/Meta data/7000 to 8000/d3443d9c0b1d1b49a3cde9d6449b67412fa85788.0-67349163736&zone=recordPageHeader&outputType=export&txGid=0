Currently, there are different capacities and hub heights for commercial wind turbine generators (WTGs). To fully capture wind energy, different wind farms (WFs) should select adequate capacity of WTGs to effectively harvest wind energy and maximize their economic benefit. To establish selection criterion, this paper first derives the equations for capacity factor (CF) and pairing performance (PP) of WTGs using Weibull and Rayleigh distribution functions. Five commercial WFs in Taiwan are used as sample systems for comparative analyses. This paper combines Weibull function, cubic mean wind speed, and four existing economic-analysis methods to study different values of capacity and hub height for WTGs that have been installed in Taiwan. Important outcomes affecting wind cost of energy in comparison with economic results using the proposed economic-analysis methods for different WFs are also presented. © 2009 IEEE.","Capacity factor (CF); Economic benefit; Pairing performance (PP); Rayleigh distribution; Weibull distribution; Wind farms (WFs); Wind turbine generators (WTGs)","Capacity factor (CF); Economic benefit; Pairing performance (PP); Rayleigh distribution; Wind farms (WFs); Wind turbine generators (WTGs); Cost benefit analysis; Distribution functions; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Engines; Farms; Global warming; Pumping plants; Turbogenerators; Weibull distribution; Wind turbines; Wind power",,,,,,"Justus, C.G., Nationwide assessment of potential power output from aero-generators (1975) Proc. 2nd U.S. Nat.
