A field experiment manipulating temperature and precipitation has been conducted in a temperate steppe in northern China since 2005. • A paired, nested experimental design was used, with increased precipitation as the primary factor and warming simulated by infrared radiators as the secondary factor. • The results for the first 2 yr showed that gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) was higher than ecosystem respiration, leading to net C sink (measured by net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE) over the growing season in the study site. The interannual variation of NEE resulted from the difference in mean annual precipitation. Experimental warming reduced GEP and NEE, whereas increased precipitation stimulated ecosystem C and water fluxes in both years. Increased precipitation also alleviated the negative effect of experimental warming on NEE. • The results demonstrate that water availability plays a dominant role in regulating ecosystem C and water fluxes and their responses to climatic change in the temperate steppe of northern China. © The Authors (2007).","Carbon; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Grassland; Precipitation","carbon; water; annual variation; carbon flux; evapotranspiration; experimental design; global warming; net ecosystem production; precipitation (climatology); steppe; temperate forest; water availability; article; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; metabolism; plant; plant leaf; temperature; time; Carbon; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Plant Leaves; Plants; Temperature; Time Factors; Water; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Barron-Gafford, G.A., Grieve, K.A., Murthy, R., Leaf- and stand-level responses of forested mesocosm to independent manipulations of temperature and vapor pressure deficit (2007) New Phytologist, 174, pp. 614-625; Billings, W.D., Luken, J.O., Mortensen, D.A., Peterson, K.M., Arctic tundra: A source or sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide in a changing environment?
