Recent phylogenetic data suggest that past climatic oscillations may have promoted long-distance marine dispersal in some freshwater crustacea from the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA). Whether this pattern is common, and whether similar processes are acting on diversification below the species level is unknown. We used nuclear and mitochondrial molecular variation in a freshwater-dependent decapod crustacean (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), sampled widely from the IAA, to assess the impact of Pleistocene sea-level changes on lineage diversification in this species. Fitting of an isolation with migration model enabled us to reject ongoing migration among lineages, and results indicate that isolation among both mainland-mainland and mainland-island lineages arose during the mid-Pleistocene. Our data suggest a scenario of widespread marine dispersal during Pleistocene glacial maxima (in support of the 'Pleistocene marine dispersal hypothesis') when sea levels were low, and geographical distances between fresh watersheds were greatly reduced, followed by increased isolation as sea levels subsequently rose. © 2007 The Authors.","Biogeography; Climate change; Dispersal; Evolution; Last Glacial Maximum; Phylogeography","fresh water; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; Australia; biological model; chemistry; classification; climate; Decapoda (Crustacea); DNA sequence; gene frequency; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; geography; growth, development and aging; haplotype; Indonesia; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; population genetics; time; Animals; Australia; Climate; Decapoda (Crustacea); DNA, Mitochondrial; Fresh Water; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Geography; Haplotypes; Indonesia; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time Factors; Variation (Genetics); Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Macrobrachium rosenbergii","GENBANK: AY554293, AY554294, AY554295, AY554296, AY554297","DNA, Mitochondrial",,,,"Archbold, N.W., Pigram, C.J., Ratman, N., Hakim, S., Indonesian Permian Brachipod fauna and Gondwana - South-East Asia relationships (1982) Nature, 296, pp. 556-558; Audley-Charles, M.G., Reconstruction of eastern Gondwanaland (1983) Nature, 306, pp. 48-50; Avise, J.C., (2000) Phylogeography: The History and Formation of Species., , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Bandelt, H.J., Forster, P., Rohl, A., Median-joining networks for inferring intraspecific phylogenies (1999) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 16, pp. 37-48; Bennett, K.J., (1997) Evolution and Ecology: The Pace of Life., , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Bermingham, E., Avise, J.C., Molecular zoogeography of freshwater fishes in the southeastern United States (1986) Genetics, 113 (4), pp. 939-965; Birky, C.W., Fuerst, P., Maruyama, T., Organelle gene diversity under migration, mutation, and drift: Equilibrium expectations, approach to equilibrium, effects of heteroplasmic cells, and comparison to nuclear genes (1989) Genetics, 121, pp. 613-627; Bohonak, A.J., Ibd (isolation by distance): A program for analyses of isolation by distance (2002) Journal of Heredity, 93, pp. 153-154; Brandon-Jones, D., Pre-glacial Bornean primate impoverishment and Wallace's Line (1998) Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia, pp. 393-404. , In: (eds.
