We report an effective method to decrease N 2O emissions from animal urine patches by treating the soil with the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD), in a simulated grazed dairy pasture system under spray irrigation. The soil was a free-draining Lismore stony silt loam (Udic Haplustept loamy skeletal) and the pasture was a mixture of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens). By treating the soil with DCD, N2O emissions were decreased by 76% following urine application in the autumn, from 26.7 kg N2O-N ha -1 without DCD to an average of 6.4 kg N2O-N ha -1 with DCD over the 6-month experimental period. N2O flux was decreased by 78% following urine application in the spring, from 18 kg N2O-N ha-1 without DCD to 3.9 kg N2O-N ha -1 with the application of DCD over the 3-month period. A single application of DCD immediately after urine was sufficient to effectively mitigate N2O emissions from the urine. The results showed that repeated applications of DCD after urine application, or mixing DCD with urine, offered no advantage over a single application of DCD immediately after urine deposition.","Dicyandiamide (DCD); Global warming; Grassland; Greenhouse gas; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide","emission control; grassland; inhibition; mitigation; nitrification; nitrous oxide; soil emission; Australasia; New Zealand; Animalia; Lolium; Lolium perenne; Trifolium; Trifolium repens",,,,,,"Amberger, A., Research on dicyandiamide as a nitrification inhibitor and future outlook (1989) Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis, 20, pp. 1933-1955; Barton, L., De Klein, C.A.M., Sherlock, R.R., (2000) N2O Emissions from Livestock Urine Applied to Pasture, , Client report prepared for the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
