Skull size and body mass increased significantly in relation to the year of collection, and skull size (but not body mass) was significantly and negatively related to latitude, contrasting Bergmann's rule and the trend found for Norwegian otters. Latitudinal differences in body size between the two countries may be due to differences in food availability. The temporal increase in body size among Swedish otters resembled that observed for Norway otters, though Swedish otters are smaller with respect to their Norwegian counterparts. Latitude and year represent a combination of environmental factors, including ambient temperature in the year of collection as well as the number of days of ice coverage. We replaced the above factors with mean annual temperature or the number of days of ice coverage, and found that each of these factors explains a similar proportion of the variation in body size as did latitude and year. We hypothesize that this temporal increase in body size is related to a combination of factors, including reduced energy expenditure resulting from increasing ambient temperature, and increased food availability from longer ice-free periods. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2010.","Ambient temperature; Body size; Eurasian otter; Food availability; Global warming; Ice coverage; Lutra lutra; Sweden","Bergmann Rule; body size; environmental factor; food availability; global warming; ice cover; mustelid; skull; spatiotemporal analysis; animal; article; body size; Carnivora; female; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; ice cover; male; Sweden; Animals; Body Size; Female; Global Warming; Ice Cover; Male; Otters; Sweden; Norway; Sweden; Carnivora; Lutra lutra; Lutrinae",,,,,,"Arrendal, J., Walker, C.W., Sundqvist, A.K., Hellborg, L., Vilà, C., Genetic evaluation of an otter translocation program (2004) Conservation Genetics, 5, pp. 79-88; Fiskbestånd och miljö i hav och sötvatten - Ressurs-och miljööversikt 2008 (2008) Fiskeriverket (The Swedish Board of Fisheries), p. 180. , http://www.fiskeriverket.se/download/18.2cd9c4ad11a113f131a8000100/ RoM2008-web.pdf, Ask, L., and H.
