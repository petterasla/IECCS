The study area extends from Pusma Camp of Nepal in the north and Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia in the south and between 80-100° E. The annual variation of temperature has also been studied using the mean monthly temperature for the variable time frames 1961-1975, 1976-1990 and 1961-1990. The trend of temperature has been analyzed using linear regression technique with the data from 1961-1990, which showed that the warming trend is dominant over the study areas except for a few stations. It has been found that Nepal shows predominant warming trends. Bangladesh and the adjacent areas of India and the northern part of Bay of Bengal adjacent to the Bangladesh coast have shown strong warming trends of the annual temperature with maximum at Dhaka (0.037 °C/year). The near equatorial zone, i.e., southern India, Sri Lanka and part of Thailand and Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur) shows warming trends in the annual mean temperature with strong warming at Pamban and Anuradhapura (around 0.04 °C/year). The cooling trends have been observed at a few stations including Port Blair, Yangoon and Cuttack. Further analysis shows the presence of prominent ENSO scale of variations with time period 4-7 years and 2-3 years for almost all the stations. The decadal mode with T > 7 years is present in some data series. The results of the variations of temperature with respect to the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) show that SOI has some negative correlation with temperature for most of the stations except those in the extreme northeast. It has been found that positive anomaly of temperature has been observed for El Niño events and negative anomaly for the La Nina events. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.
