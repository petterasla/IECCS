As one of the most important incentive-based policy instruments, carbon tax has sparked a lively controversy in China. This paper explores the impact of carbon tax on Chinese economy, as well as the cushion effects of the complementary policies, by constructing a dynamic recursive general equilibrium model. The model can describe the new equilibrium for each sequential independent period (e.g. one year) after carbon tax and the complementary policies are imposed, and thus describe the long-term impacts of the policies. The simulation results show that carbon tax is an effective policy tool because it can reduce carbon emissions with a little negative impact on economic growth; reducing indirect tax in the meantime of imposing carbon tax will help to reduce the negative impact of the tax on production and competitiveness; in addition, giving households subsidy in the meantime will help to stimulate household consumptions. Therefore, complementary policies used together with carbon tax will help to cushion the negative impacts of carbon tax on the economy. The dynamic CGE analysis shows the impact of carbon tax policy on the GDP is relatively small, but the reduction of carbon emission is relatively large. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon tax; China; Complementary policy","Carbon emissions; Carbon taxes; China; Chinese economy; Chinese Government; Complementary policy; Domestic energy; Economic growths; General equilibrium models; Negative impacts; Policy instruments; Policy tools; Simulation result; Competition; Dynamic analysis; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Taxation; carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; energy policy; global warming; pollution tax; China",,,,,,"Chen, H., Zhang, L., Thoughts about the feasibility of using carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gases emissions (2009) Finance Forum, 1, pp. 35-40; (2000) Chinese Study of Climate Change, , Tsinghua Publication, Beijing, The Chinese Study Group of Climate Change; Gao, P., Chen, W., Carbon tax and carbon emissions (2002) Tsinghua Science and Technology, 10, pp. 1335-1338; Govinda, R., (2007), Timilsina, The role of revenue recycling schemes in environmental tax selection: a general equilibrium analysis.
