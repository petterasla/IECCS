Satellite-measured land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely used to assess large scale phenological patterns and processes. However, the accuracy of LSP is rarely validated with spatially compatible field data due to the significant spatiotemporal scale mismatch. In this study, we employ intensive field observations specifically designed to address this deficiency. High density/frequency spring phenological observations were collected in a mixed seasonal forest during 2008 and 2009. A landscape up-scaling approach was used to derive landscape phenology (LP) indices from plot-level observations in order to validate Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based LSP. Results show that the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived start of spring season (SOS) measure was able to predict LP full bud burst date with absolute errors less than two days. In addition, LSP derived SOS captured inter-annual variations and spatial differences that agreed with ground observations. Comparison of complete time series of LP and LSP revealed that fundamental differences exist between the two observation means, e.g., LP development had increased influence on LSP during the course of spring onset. Therefore, inferring continuous LP processes directly from LSP measures could be problematic. However, using LSP derived from techniques such as logistic curve modeling for extracting seasonal markers appears more promising. This study contributes to a more explicit understanding of the linkages between remotely sensed phenology and traditionally observed (ground-based) phenology. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","EOS land validation core sites; Land surface phenology; Landscape phenology; MODIS; Phenology; Validation","EOS land validation core sites; Land surface phenology; Landscape phenology; MODIS; Phenology; Validation; Curricula; Ecology; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Systems engineering; Time series; Vegetation; Climate change; accuracy assessment; annual variation; climate change; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; forest ecosystem; frequency analysis; identification key; land surface; landscape; logistics; MODIS; numerical model; observational method; phenology; radiometer; remote sensing; resolution; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; time series",,,,,,"Ahrends, H., Brügger, R., Stöckli, R., Schenk, J., Michna, P., Jeanneret, F., Quantitative phenological observations of a mixed beech forest in northern Switzerland with digital photography (2008) Journal of Geophysical Research, 113, pp. G04004; Burrows, S., Gower, S., Clayton, M., Mackay, D., Ahl, D., Norman, J., Application of geostatistics to characterize Leaf Area Index(LAI) from flux tower to landscape scales using a cyclic sampling design (2002) Ecosystems, 5, pp. 667-679; Cheng, P., Toutin, T., Zhang, Y., Wood, M., QuickBird-geometric correction, path and block processing and data fusion (2003) Earth Observation Magazine, 12, pp. 24-30; Clayton, M., Hudelson, B., Confidence intervals for autocorrelations based on cyclic samples (1995) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 90, pp. 753-757; Cleland, E.E., Chuine, I., Menzel, A., Mooney, H.A., Schwartz, M.D., Shifting plant phenology in response to global change (2007) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 22, pp. 357-365; de Beurs, K.M., Henebry, G.M., Land surface phenology, climatic variation, and institutional change: Analyzing agricultural land cover change in Kazakhstan (2004) Remote Sensing of Environment, 89, pp. 497-509; de Beurs, K.M., Henebry, G.M., Land surface phenology and temperature variation in the International GeosphereBiosphere Program high-latitude transects (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 779-790; de Beurs, K.M., Henebry, G.M., Northern annular mode effects on the land surface phenologies of northern Eurasia (2008) Journal of Climate, 21, pp. 4257-4279; de Beurs, K.M., Henebry, G.M., Spatio-temporal statistical methods for modeling land surface phenology (2010) Phenological research: Methods for environmental and climate change analysis, pp. 177-208. , Springer, Dordrecht, I.L.
