Sci. and Eng., CB 7400, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7400, United States","The short-term (24 h) and medium-term (30 day) influence of N salts (NH4Cl, NaNO3 and NaNO2) and a non-N salt (NaCl) on first-order rate constants, k (h-1) and thresholds (C(Th)) for atmospheric CH4 oxidation by homogenized composites of upland boreal forest and tundra soils was assessed at salt additions ranging to 20 μmol g-1 dry weight (dw) soil. Additions of NH4Cl, NaNO3 and NaCl to 0.5 μmol g-1 dw soil did not significantly decrease k relative to watered controls in the short term. Higher concentrations significantly reduced k, with the degree of inhibition increasing with increasing dose. Similar doses of NH4Cl and NaCl gave comparable decreases in k relative to controls and both soils showed low native concentrations of NH4/+-N (≤1 μmol g-1 dw soil), suggesting that the reduction in k was due primarily to a salt influence rather than competitive inhibition of CH4 oxidation by exogenous NH4/+-N or NH4/+-N released through cation exchange. The decrease in k was consistently less for NaNO3 than for NH4Cl and NaCl at similar doses, pointing to a strong inhibitory effect of the Cl- counter-anion. Thresholds for CH4 oxidation were less sensitive to salt addition than k for these three salts, as significant increases in C(Th) relative to controls were only observed at concentrations ≥ 1.0 μmol g-1 dw soil. Both soils were more sensitive to NaNO2 than to other salts in the short term, showing a significant decrease in k at an addition of 0.25 μmol NaNO2 g-1 dw soil that was clearly attributable to NO2/-. Soils showed no recovery from NaCl, NH4/+-N or NaNO3 addition with respect to atmospheric CH4 oxidation after 30 days. However, soils amended with NaNO2 to 1.0 μmol NaNO2 g-1 dw showed values of k that were not significantly different from controls. Recovery of CH4-oxidizing ability was due to complete oxidation of NO2/-N to NO3/-N. Analysis of soil concentrations of N salts necessary to inhibit atmospheric CH4 oxidation and regional rates of N deposition suggest that N deposition will not decrease the future sink strength of upland high-latitude soils in the atmospheric CH4 budget.","Ammonium; Methane oxidation; Nitrogen fertilization; Tundra soil; Upland boreal soil","ammonium chloride; atmosphere; boreal forest; ion exchange; methane; nitrogen; oxidation; reaction mechanism; salt; sodium chloride; sodium nitrate; sodium nitrite; soil; tundra; atmospheric deposition; forest soil; methane; nitrogen; oxidation; salt; tundra soil",,,,,,"Adams, R.M., Rosenzweig, C., Peart, R.M., Ritchie, J.T., McCarl, B.A., Glyer, J.D., Curry, R.B., Allen L.H., Jr., Global climate change and U.S. Agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-224; Adamsen, A.P.S., King, G.M., CH4 consumption in temperate and subarctic forest soils: Rates, vertical zonation and responses to water and nitrogen (1993) Appl Environ Microbiol, 59, pp. 485-490; Bender, M., Conrad, R., Kinetics of methane oxidation in oxic soils (1993) Chemosphere, 26, pp. 687-696; Bender, M., Conrad, R., Methane oxidation activity in various soils and freshwater sediments: Occurrence, characteristics, vertical profiles, and distribution on grain size fractions (1994) J Geophys Res, 99, pp. 16531-16540; Bender, M., Conrad, R., Effect of CH4 concentrations and soil conditions on the induction of CH4 oxidation activity (1995) Soil Biol Biochem, 12, pp. 1517-1527; Boeckx, P., Van Cleemput, O., Meyer, T., The influence of land use and pesticides on methane oxidation in some Belgian soils (1998) Biol Fertil Soils, 27, pp. 293-298; Börjesson, G., Nohrstedt, H.-Ö., Short-and long-term effects of nitrogen fertilization on methane oxidation in three Swedish forest soils (1998) Biol Fertil Soils, 27, pp. 113-118; Bormann, B.T., Tarrant, R.F., McClellan, H.M., Savage, T., Chemistry of rainwater and cloud water at remote sites in Alaska and Oregon (1989) J Environ Qual, 18, pp. 149-152; Bouwman, A.F., Introduction (1990) Soils and the Greenhouse Effect, pp. 25-32. , Bouwman AF (ed).
