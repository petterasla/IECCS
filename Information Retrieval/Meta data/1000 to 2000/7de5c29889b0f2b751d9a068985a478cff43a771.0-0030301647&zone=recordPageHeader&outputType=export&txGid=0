Recent work suggests that anticipated global warming may be uneven, with a significant increase in night compared to day temperature. Sun-lit, outdoor environment chambers were used to determine the impact of increasing night temperatures at two constant day temperatures (29/21, 29/25, 29/29°C and 33/25, 33/29 and 33/33°C) as well as increasing day/night temperature (29/21, 33/25 and 36/29°C) on growth and yield of rice (cv. IR 72). Increasing day/night temperature to 36/29°C resulted in a significant reduction in both plant biomass and grain yield at harvest. At a constant day temperature of 29°C, increasing night temperature did not significantly alter growth or yield; however, increasing night temperature at a day temperature of 33°C (8 h duration) resulted in a significant decline in grain yield, primarily due to reduced seed set. The decline in grain yield at 33°C with increasing night time temperature was similar to that observed at a day/night temperature of 36/29°C. Data from this experiment suggest that higher night time temperatures per se could increase the susceptibility of rice to sterility with a subsequent reduction in seed set and grain yield.",,"climatic change; night temperature; rice; seed set; temperature; tropics; yield; Oryza sativa; Poaceae",,,,,,"Ahmed, F.E., Hall, A.E., DeMason, D.A., Heat injury during floral development in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata, Fabaceae) (1992) American Journal of Botany, 79, pp. 784-791; DeDatta, S.K., (1981) Principles and Practices of Rice Production, , John Wiley and Sons: New York; Dickinson, R.E., Cicerone, R.J., Future global warming from atmospheric trace gases (1986) Nature, 319, pp. 109-115; Kerr, R.A., Greenhouse warming still coming (1986) Science, 232, pp. 573-575; Kukla, G., Karl, T.R., Nighttime warming and the greenhouse effect (1993) Environmental Science and Technology, 27, pp. 1468-1474; Kuroyanagi, T., Paulsen, G.M., Mode of high temperature injury to wheat.
