When used in forestry, 60-80% of these hydraulic fluids are released into the environment. This is one of the reasons for the growing interest for developing and utilizing hydraulic fluids with good environmental performance. Another driving force in the development of hydraulic fluids is to replace fossil products with renewable ones. The aim of this paper is to investigate the environmental impact of two types of hydraulic fluids, one based on mineral oil and one on vegetable oil. The difference in environmental impact of using chemical or biocatalytic production methods is also assessed. Materials and methods: This life cycle assessment is from cradle-to-gate, including waste treatment. A complementary, laboratory, biodegradability test was also performed. The functional unit is 1 l of base fluid for hydraulic fluids, and mass allocation is applied. A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of the energy used and of the allocation method. The impact categories studied are primary energy consumption, global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP), photooxidant creation potential (POCP) and biodegradability. Results and discussion: The contribution to GWP and primary energy consumption was higher for the mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid than the vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluids. The contributions to EP and AP were higher for the vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid than the mineral oil-based one. The vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid had better biodegradability than the one based on mineral oil. The impact of production method was minor, thus the biocatalytic method gives no significant advantage over chemical methods concerning energy and environmental performance. Conclusions: For the environmental impact categories GWP, POCP and primary energy consumption, hydraulic fluids based on rapeseed oil make a lower contribution than a mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid. For EP and AP, the contributions of TMP oleate are higher than the contribution of mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid. The difference between the chemically catalysed method and the ezymatically catalysed method is negligible because the major environmental impact is due to the production of the raw materials. The vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid, TMP oleate, was more biodegradable than the mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Biocatalytic production; Biodegradability; Biolubricants; Hydraulic fluids; Life cycle assessment; Rapeseed oil; Trimethylolpropane (TMP)","hydraulic fluid; lubricating agent; mineral oil; rapeseed oil; unclassified drug; vegetable oil; acidification; article; biocatalysis; biodegradability; biomass allocation; controlled study; energy consumption; energy cost; environmental impact; environmental parameters; greenhouse effect; industrial production; life cycle assessment; photooxidation; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; waste management; Brassica napus",,"rapeseed oil, 8002-13-9",,,,"Andersson, L., Severinsson, M., (1996) Partial Life Cycle Assessment of Pentaerytritol Production, , Internal report (Confidential) Perstorp Regeno; Bartels, T., Bock, W., Braun, J., Busch, C., Buss, W., Dresel, W., Freiler, C., Omeis, J., (2005) Lubricants and Lubrication, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, , Wiley-VHC Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, Weinheim; Bernesson, S., Nilsson, D., Hansson, P.-A., A limited LCA comparing large- and small-scale production of rape methyl ester (RME) under Swedish conditions (2004) Biomass and Bioenergy, 26 (6), pp. 545-559. , DOI 10.1016/j.biombioe.2003.10.003, PII S0961953403001879; (2010), http://www.aak.com/en/ProductsApplications/Binolbiolubricants/Products/ Forestry-Construction/, BinolBlanch, H.W., Clark, D.S., (1997) Biochemical Engineering, , Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York; Börjesson, P., Tufvesson, L.M., Agricultural crop-based biofuels-resource efficiency and environmental performance including direct land use changes (2010) J Clean Prod, , doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.01.001; Boustead, I., (2005) Eco-profiles of the European Plastics Industry PROPYLENE, , A report for Plastics Europe, March 2005; Boustead, I., (2005) Eco-profiles of the European Plastics Industry PHENOL, , A report for Plastics Europe, March 2005; Boustead, I., (2005) Eco-profiles of the European Plastics Industry TOLUENE, , A report for Plastics Europe, March 2005; Boustead, I., (2005) Eco-profiles of the European Plastics Industry PENTANE, , A report for Plastics Europe, March 2005; Boustead, I., (2005) Eco-profiles of the European Plastics Industry CRUDE OIL, , A report for Plastics Europe, March 2005; Cederberg, C., Flysjö, A., (2008) Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in A Life Cycle Perspective and Use of Energy and Land in Production of RME from Swedish Rapeseed, , Report P80453, The Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology; (2007) Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Petroleum Refining Industry, , http://www.energetics.com/resourcecenter/products/studies/Documents/ PetroleumRefining-Energy-EnvironmentalProfile.pdf, Energetics Incorporated, U.S. Department of Energy Industrial Technologies Program; (2005) Official Journal of the European Union, , European Commission, L 118/26, 5.5.2005; (2008) Om Spillolja, Miljödepartementet 1993-11-18, Ändrad, 250. , Svensk Författningssamling (SFS) Förordning (1993:1268); Hatti-Kaul, R., Tornvall, U., Gustafsson, L., Borjesson, P., Industrial biotechnology for the production of bio-based chemicals - a cradle-to-grave perspective (2007) Trends in Biotechnology, 25 (3), pp. 119-124. , DOI 10.1016/j.tibtech.2007.01.001, PII S0167779907000170; N2O emissions from managed soils and CO2 emissions from lime and urea application (2006) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 4. , IPCC, Chapter 11; Johnsson, H., Martensson, K., (2002) Kväveläckage Fran Svensk Akermark -Beräkningar Av Normalutlakning för 1995 Och 1999, , Rapport 5248, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Lämsä, M., (1996) Process for Preparing a Synthetic Ester from a Vegetable Oil, , International patent number WO 96/07632; Lantz, M., Ekman, A., Börjesson, P., (2009) Systemoptimerad Production Av Fordonsgas en Miljö- Och Energisystemanalys Av Söderasens Biogasanläggning, , Report 69, Environmental and Energy System Studies, Lund University; Lynch, T.R., (2008) Process Chemistry of Lubricant Base Stocks, pp. 1-20. , Taylor and Francis Group CRC New York, chapter 1; Martensson, P., Svensson, M., (2009) Miljösystemstudie Svensk RME Och Etanol i Tunga Fordon -en Kunskapsuppdatering, , Masters Thesis, Lund University; McManus, M., (2001) Life Cycle Assessment of Rapeseed and Mineral Oil Based Fluid Power Systems, , Dissertation, University of Bath; Möller, U.J., Young, D., (2007) Hydraulic Fluids.
