Risk assessments and ecological assessments have some parallel procedures and the authors briefly compare some common objectives and approaches. The focus of the discussions is in the context of ecological assessment, gathering and evaluating of data most relevant to the S Florida mangroves and associated habitats, and the framework to combined diverse sets of scientific data for the broader or more generalized perspectives and long-term information needs of policy formulation. -from Authors",,"climate change; climatic change; ecological balance; mangrove ecosystem; mangrove swamps; USA, Florida",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00074977,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028565146
