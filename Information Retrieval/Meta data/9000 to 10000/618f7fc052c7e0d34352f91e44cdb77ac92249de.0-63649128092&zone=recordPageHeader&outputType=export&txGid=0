Results of a long-term (30 year) experiment in the Indian Himalayas under rainfed soybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation was analyzed to determine the influence of mineral fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) application at 10 Mg ha-1 on SOC and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks and distribution within different aggregate size fractions. Fertilizers (NP, NK and NPK) and FYM in combination with N or NPK were applied before the soybean crop every year and no nutrient was applied before the wheat crop. Results showed that addition of FYM with N or NPK fertilizers increased SOC and TSN contents. The overall gain in SOC in the 0- to 45-cm soil depth interval in the plots under NPK+FYM treatment over NPK was 17.18 Mg Cha-1 in 30 year. The rate of conversion of input C to SOC was about 19% of each additional Mg C input per hectare. SOC content in large size aggregates was greater than in smaller size aggregates, and declined with decreased aggregate size. Thus, long-term soybean-wheat rotation in a sandy loam soil of the Indian Himalayas sequestered carbon and nitrogen. Soil organic C and TSN sequestration in the 0.25- to 0.1-mm size fraction is an ideal indicator of long-term C and N sequestration, since this fraction retained maximum SOC/TSN stock. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Aggregate associated C and N; C sequestration; C:N ratio; Continuous soybean-wheat cropping; Mineral and organic fertilization; Total soil nitrogen storage; Total soil organic carbon storage","aggregate size; carbon sequestration; crop rotation; crop yield; farming system; fertilizer application; global warming; long-term change; nitrogen cycle; soil carbon; soil depth; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; soybean; wheat; Himalayas; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Aoyama, M., Angers, D.A., N'Dayegamiye, A., Particulate and mineral-associated organic matter in water-stable aggregates as affected by mineral fertilizer and manure applications (1999) Can J Soil Sci, 79, pp. 295-302; Aoyama, M., Angers, D.A., N'Dayegamiye, A., Bissonnette, N., Metabolism of C-13-labeled glucose in aggregates from soils with manure application (2000) Soil Biol Biochem, 32, pp. 295-300. , doi:10.1016/S0038-0717(99)00152-2; Aulakh, M.S., Khera, T.S., Doran, J.W., Bronson, K.F., Managing crop residue with green manure, urea, and tillage in a rice-wheat rotation (2001) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 65, pp. 820-827; Bayer, C., Martin-Neto, L., Mielniczuk, J., Pillon, C.N., Sangoi, L., Changes in soil organic matter fractions under subtropical no-till cropping systems (2001) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 65, pp. 1473-1478; Bhandari, A.L., Ladha, J.K., Pathak, H., Padre, A.T., Dawe, D., Gupta, R.K., Yield and soil nutrient changes in a long-term rice-wheat rotation in India (2002) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 66, pp. 162-170; Bhattacharyya, R., Ved-Prakash, K., Srivastva, A.K., Gupta, H.S., Effect of long term manuring on soil organic carbon, bulk density and water retention characteristics under soybean-wheat cropping sequence in N-W Himalayas (2004) J Indian Soc Soil Sci, 52, pp. 238-242; Bhattacharyya, R., Prakash, V., Kundu, S., Ghosh, B.N., Srivastva, A.K., Gupta, H.S., Potassium balance as influenced by farmyard manure application under continuous soybean-wheat cropping system in a typic Haplaquept (2006) Geoderma, 137, pp. 155-160. , doi:10.1016/j.geoderma.2006.08.006; Buresh, R.J., de Datta, S.K., Nitrogen dynamics and management in rice-legume cropping system (1991) Adv Agron, 45, pp. 1-59. , doi:10.1016/S0065-2113(08)60037-1; Buyanovsky, G.A., Aslam, M., Wagner, G.H., Carbon turnover in soil physical fractions (1994) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 58, pp. 1167-1173; Cambardella, C.A., Elliott, E.J., Carbon and nitrogen dynamics of soil organic matter fractions from cultivated grassland soils (1994) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 58, pp. 123-130; Chardravansi, P., Sudhir, K., Srikanth, K., Siddaramappa, R., Effect of long-term fertilizer use and cropping on physical properties of an Alfisol (1999) Mysore J Agric Sci, 33, pp. 115-118; Collins, H.P., Rasmussen, P.E., Douglas Jr., C.L., Crop rotation and residue management effects on soil carbon and microbial dynamics (1992) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 56, pp. 783-788; Elliott, E.T., Aggregate structure and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in native and cultivated soils (1986) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 50, pp. 627-633; Emerson, W.W., Physical properties and structure (1977) Soil Factors in Crop Production in a Semi-Arid Environment, pp. 78-104. , J.
