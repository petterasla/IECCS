We studied demography and population dynamics of the sympatric perennial herbs Drosera anglica and D. rotundifolia on a boreal bog in SE Norway. Dry mass of 2872 D. anglica plants and 2467 D. rotundifolia plants (estimated from field morphological measurements) was used to classify plants into five species-specific size classes. Demographic changes within these two populations were followed from 1995 to 1999, and within segments (quartiles) along the water table gradient and the peat productivity gradient. 2. Mortality was strongly size dependent, and varied between years, for both species; it was high for seedlings, low for the smallest mature rosettes and increased again for the largest mature rosettes. The proportion of fertile rosettes increased with increasing rosette size. Fecundity varied considerably between years, but little relative to gradient position. 3. Growth rate (λ) was > 1, except in the second year, when it fell to 0.572 for D. anglica and 0.627 for D. rotundifolia. For D. anglica small, but significant, differences were found between the two extremities of the water table gradient, and for D. rotundifolia between the second and the uppermost quartile. There was a tendency for D. anglica populations to have a lower growth rate in the most productive sites, whereas D. rotundifolia grew less on both low and high peat productivity. Elasticity analysis showed that stasis and size increase (primarily within mature stages) made major contributions to λ for D. anglica in all years. 4. The variance in population growth rate (var λ) was high between years, and higher for D. anglica than for D. rotundifolia, while the variance between quartiles along the two main gradients was low. Life-table response experiment (LTRE) analyses revealed that for both species, differences in probabilities of transitions within mature stages, and in growth to larger stages, contributed most to var λ. 5. The effects of global warming are uncertain: drier growing seasons would affect Drosera populations negatively, while initially positive responses to a wetter climate may be balanced by competition from increased Sphagnum growth.","Bootstrapping; Demography; Elasticity analysis; Life-table response experiment analysis; Norway; Ombrotrophic bogs; Peatland; Population growth rate; Transition matrix modelling","demography; fecundity; growth rate; life table; ombrotrophic environment; peatland; population dynamics; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Drosera; Drosera anglica; Drosera rotundifolia; Sphagnum",,,,,,"Aerts, R., Wallén, B., Malmer, N., Growth limiting nutrients in Sphagnum-dominated bogs subject to low and high atmospheric nitrogen supply (1992) Journal of Ecology, 80, pp. 131-140; Albert, V., Williams, S.E., Chase, M.W., Carnivorous plants: Phylogeny and structural evolution (1992) Science, 257, pp. 1491-1495; Alvarez-Buylla, E.R., Slatkin, M., Finding confidence limits on population growth rates (1991) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 6, pp. 221-224; Austin, M.P., Searching for a model for use in vegetation analysis (1980) Vegetatio, 42, pp. 11-21; Backéus, I., Aboveground production and growth dynamics of vascular bog plants in Central Sweden (1985) Acta PhytoGeographica Suecica, 74, pp. 1-98; Berendse, F., Van Breemen, N., Rydin, H., Buttler, A., Heijmans, M., Hoosbeek, M.R., Raised atmospheric CO2 levels and increased N deposition cause shifts in plant species composition and production in Sphagnum bogs (2001) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 591-598; Bierzychudek, P., Looking backwards: Assessing the projections of a transition matrix model (1999) Ecological Applications, 9, pp. 1278-1287; Boatman, D.J., The Silver Flowe National Reserve, Galloway, Scotland (1983) Journal of Biogeography, 10, pp. 163-274; Van Breemen, N., How Sphagnum bogs down other plants (1995) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 10, pp. 270-275; Brewer, J.S., Effects of competition and litter on a carnivorous plant, Drosera capillaris (Droseraceae) (1998) American Journal of Botany, 85, pp. 1592-1596; Brewer, J.S., Effects of fire, competition and soil disturbance on regeneration of a carnivorous plant (Drosera capillaris) (1999) American Midland Naturalist, 141, pp. 28-42; Brewer, J.S., A demographic analysis of fire-stimulated seedling establishment of Sarracenia alata (Sarraceniaceae) (2001) American Journal of Botany, 88, pp. 1250-1257; Caswell, H., (2001) Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis and Interpretation, 2nd Edn., , Sinauer, Sunderland; Van Cleve, K., Alexander, V., Nitrogen cycling in tundra and boreal ecosystems (1981) Ecological Bulletins, 33, pp. 375-404; Clymo, R.S., Hayward, P.M., The ecology of Sphagnum (1982) Bryophyte Ecology, pp. 229-289. , ed.
