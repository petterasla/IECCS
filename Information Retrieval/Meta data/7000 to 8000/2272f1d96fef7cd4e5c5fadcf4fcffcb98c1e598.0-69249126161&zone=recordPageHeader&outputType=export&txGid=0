Over the last 2 decades, this trend appears to have accelerated. In contrast to this general behavior, however, here it is shown that trends during the boreal cold months in the recent period have developed a marked asymmetry between early winter and late winter for the Northern Hemisphere, with vigorous warming in October-December followed by a reversal to a neutral/cold trend in January-March. This observed asymmetry in the cold half of the boreal year is linked to a two-way stratosphere-troposphere interaction, which is strongest in the Northern Hemisphere during late winter and is related to variability in Eurasian land surface conditions during autumn. This link has been demonstrated for year-to-year variability and used to improve seasonal time-scale winter forecasts; here, this coupling is shown to strongly modulate the warming trend, with implications for decadal-scale temperature projections. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Boreal winters; Global surface temperature; Land surface conditions; Northern Hemispheres; Planetary Waves; Temperature projection; Time-scales; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Sulfur compounds; Upper atmosphere; Atmospherics; air temperature; climate forcing; decadal variation; global warming; greenhouse gas; Northern Hemisphere; planetary wave; stratosphere-troposphere interaction; winter; Eurasia",,,,,,"Baldwin, M.P., Dunkerton, T.J., Stratospheric harbingers of anomalous weather regimes (2001) Science, 294, pp. 581-584; Brohan, P., Kennedy, J.J., Harris, I., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, P.D., Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: A new dataset from 1850 (2006) J.
