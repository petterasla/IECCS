Therefore, it is of great importance to understand decadal variability and future trends as they are projected by global and regional climate change simulations. In this paper, trends and variability of hydro-meteorological quantities are investigated in simulation results for the period 1900 to 2100. Special attention is paid to the differences in the climate change signals which are simulated within three individual simulations of one IPCC SRES scenario (here: three realisations of A1B) as compared with those in three simulations of different IPCC SRES scenarios (one ralisation each for A2, A1B and B1). In addition results from a validation run for 1958 to 2002 which are compared with observations, show the capability of the regional model to simulate today's climate. From the 200-year simulations it can be concluded that in all of them the differences in the hydro-meteorological quantities are of similar order, despite of significant differences in temperature trends. The relation between an increase in temperature eand an intensification of the hydrological cycle is also analysed. This study shows that the differences in the IPCC SRES emission scenarios lead to significantly different temperature developments until the end of this century, but they do not stimulate significant differences in the developments of the hydrological cycles. At present this behaviour cannot be explained and needs further investigations. © 2009.",,,,,,,,"Arpe, K., Hagemann, S., Jacob, D., Roeckner, E., The realism of the ECHAM5 models to simulate the hydrological cycle in the Arctic and North European area (2005) Nordic Hydrology, 36, pp. 349-367; (2008) Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin, , BACC, Springer Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg; (2005) BALTEX PHASE I, 1993-2002, State of the Art Report, , BALTEX, International BALTEX Secretariat Publication Series 31, International BALTEX Secretariat, GKSS Geesthacht, Germany; Beck, C., Grieser, J., Rudolf, B., A new monthly precipitation climatology for the global land areas for the period 1951 to 2000 (2005) Climate Status Report 2004, pp. 181-190. , German Weather Service, Offenbach, Germany; Bumke, K., Clemens, M., Precipitation measurements over sea (2001) WCRP/SCOR Workshop on Ocean-Atmosphere Flux Fields, pp. 303-306. , In: While G.
