In the new specification, warming cost is represented as the product of possible large warming related welfare losses which occur with small probabilities that depend on the amount of temperature rise. This is in contrast to the conventional representation of warming cost as a deterministic function of temperature rise. To avoid 'curse of dimensionality' problems, we assume that losses affect the utility of consumption without directly affecting consumption itself, and that the probability of losses occurring is independent of the number of losses that may have previously occurred. The results we obtain using this new approach depend importantly on the specification of the loss probability function. Nevertheless, our results are qualitatively similar to previous results obtained using a deterministic specification of warming cost, in which cost is a cubic function of temperature rise. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"climate change model; global warming cost; greenhouse gas",,,,,,"Chao, Hung-Po: 1995, ‘Managing the Risk of Global Climate Catastrophe: An Uncertainty Analysis’, Risk Analys., (forthcoming)Cline, W.R., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington D.C; Dowlatabadi, H. et al.: 1994, ‘An Overview of the Integrated Climate Assessment Model, version 2: ICAM-2’, paper presented at the Western Economic Association Conference, Vancouver, B.C.
