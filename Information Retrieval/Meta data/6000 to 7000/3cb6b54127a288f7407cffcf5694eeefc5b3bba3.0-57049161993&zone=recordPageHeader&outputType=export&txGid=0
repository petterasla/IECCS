The international communities have reached a consensus to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions and restrain global warming. The quantitative assessment of anthropogenic GHG emissions is the scientific basis to find out the status of global GHG emission, identify the commitments of each country, and arrange the international efforts of GHG emission reduction. Currently the main assessment indicators for GHG emission include national indicator, per capita indicator, per GDP indicator, and international trade indicator etc. The introduction to the above indicators is put forward and their merits and demerits are analyzed. Based on the GHG emission data from the World Resource Institute (WRI), the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), the results of each indictor are calculated for the world, for the eight G8 industrialized countries (USA, UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Russia), and the five major developing countries including China, Brazil, India, South Africa and Mexico. The paper points out that all these indicators have some limitations. The Indicator of Industrialized Accumulative Emission per Capita (IAEC) is put forward as the equitable indicator to evaluate the industrialized historical accumulative emission per capita of every country. IAEC indicator can reflect the economic achievement of GHG emission enjoyed by the current generations in every country and their commitments. The analysis of IAEC indicates that the historical accumulative emission per capita in industrialized countries such as UK and USA were typically higher than those of the world average and the developing countries. Emission indicator per capita per GDP, consumptive emission indicator and survival emission indicator are also put forward and discussed in the paper. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Assessment indicator; Emission indicator per capita per GDP; Global warming; Greenhouse gases (GHG) emission; Industrialized Accumulative Emission per Capita (IAEC)",,,,,,,"Ahmad, N., (2003) A Framework for Estimating Carbon Dioxide Emissions Embodied in International Trade of Goods, , OECD Paris; Global, Regional, and National Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissions., , http://cdiac.ornl.gov, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , IPCC IPCC Secretariat; Ren, G., Xu, Y., Luo, Y., The status and history of CO2 emission from world countries (2002) Meteorological Science and Technology, 30, pp. 129-134. , 3; Ruddiman, W., The anthropogenic greenhouse era began thousands of years ago (2003) Climate Change, 61, pp. 261-293; Ruddiman, W., Thomson, J., The case for human causes of increased atmospheric CH4 over the last 5000 years (2001) Quaternary Science Reviews, 20, pp. 1769-1777; Who owns China's carbon emissions?
