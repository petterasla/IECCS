This results from the kinetic characteristics of Rubisco, and bas potentially important implications for responses of vegetation to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. It is often assumed that because Rubisco characteristics are conservative, all C3 species have the same temperature dependence of the response of photosynthesis to elevated carbon dioxide. However, in this field study of Taraxacum officinale, there were no significant differences in the relative stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide among days with temperatures ranging from 15 to 34 °C. Nevertheless, short-term measurements indicated a strong temperature dependence of the stimulation. This suggested that acclimation to temperature caused the lack of variation in the seasonal data. Experiments in controlled environments indicated that complete acclimation of the relative stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide occurred for growth temperatures of 10 - 25 °C. The apparent specificity of Rubisco for carbon dioxide relative to oxygen at 15 °C. as assayed in vivo by measurements of the carbon dioxide concentration at which carboxylation equalled oxygenation, also varied with growth temperature. Changes in the apparent specificity of Rubisco accounted for the acclimation of the temperature dependence of the relative stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide. It is premature to conclude that low temperatures will necessarily reduce the relative stimulation of photosynthesis caused by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide.","Global change; Global warming; Photosynthesis models; Rubisco","acclimatization; air temperature; carbon dioxide; carboxylation; in vivo study; ozone; plant growth; plant response; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; taraxacum officinale",,,,,,"Brooks, A., Farquhar, G.D., Effect of temperature on the CO2/O2 specificity of ribulose-l.5bisphosphate carboyxlase/oxygenase and the rate of respiration in the light.
