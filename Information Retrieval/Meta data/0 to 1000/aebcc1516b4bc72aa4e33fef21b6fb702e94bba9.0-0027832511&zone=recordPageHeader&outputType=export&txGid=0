Thus, we demonstrate that trend tests based on models such as Yt = a + bt + Et for the purpose of prediction or inference concerning future behavior should be used with caution. -from Authors",,"global warming; greenhouse gas; moving average model; statistics; time series; trend analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08948755,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027832511
