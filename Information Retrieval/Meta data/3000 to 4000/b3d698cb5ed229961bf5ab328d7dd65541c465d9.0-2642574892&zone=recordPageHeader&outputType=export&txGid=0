The use of fiberoptic-based solar concentrating systems for microalgal photobiorectors has the potential to meet the two essential criteria in the design of a lighting system for algal photobioreactors: (1) electrical energy efficiency; and (2) lighting distribution efficiency. The overall efficiencies of solar concentrating systems have significantly improved in recent years, exceeding 45%. Meanwhile, achieving uniform lighting distribution within photobioreactors constitutes probably the greatest challenge in using fiberoptic-based solar concentrators as a lighting system for photobioreactors. The light-emitting fibers appeared to be a most promising candidate in achieving such uniform light distribution in photobioreactors. Also, when a hybrid-solar-and-electric-lighting scheme is adopted to augment solar lighting whenever needed, the hybrid lighting distribution needs to be designed accordingly. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
