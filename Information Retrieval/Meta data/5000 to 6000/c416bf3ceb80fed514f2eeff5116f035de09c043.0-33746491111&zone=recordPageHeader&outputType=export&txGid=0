Extinction risk under climate change scenarios is a function of distribution breadth. Focusing on trees and birds of the eastern United States, we used joint climate and environment models to examine fit and climate change vulnerability as a function of distribution breadth. We found that extinction vulnerability increases with decreasing distribution size. We also found that model fit decreases with decreasing distribution size, resulting in high prediction uncertainty among narrowly distributed species. High prediction uncertainty creates a conservation dilemma in that excluding these species under-predicts extinction risk and favors mistaken inaction on global warming. By contrast, including narrow endemics results in overpredicting extinction risk and promotes mistaken inaction on behalf of individual species prematurely considered doomed to extinction. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate and environmental models; Climate change; Distribution breadth; Eastern United States; Endemic; Extinction; Prediction uncertainty; Regression tree; Vulnerability","bird; climate change; climate modeling; environmental modeling; extinction risk; global warming; population distribution; prediction; tree; vulnerability; animal; article; biological model; bird; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; population dynamics; species extinction; tree; Animals; Birds; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Trees; North America; United States; Aves",,,,,,"Berry, P.M., Dawson, T.R., Harrison, R.A., Modelling potential impacts of climate change on the bioclimatic envelope of species in Britain and Ireland (2002) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 11, pp. 453-462; Boer, G.J., Flato, G.M., Ramsden, D., A transient climate change simulation with historical and projected greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing: Projected climate for the 21st century (2000) Climate Dynamics, 16, pp. 427-451; Box, E.O., Crumpacker, D.W., Hardin, E.D., Predicted effects of climate change on distributions of ecologically important native tree and shrub species in Florida (1999) Climatic Change, 41, pp. 213-248; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45, pp. 5-32; Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R.A., Stone, C.J.W.B., (1984) Classification and Regression Trees, , Wadsworth, Pacific Grove, California, USA; Bush, M.B., Distributional change and conservation on the Andean flank: A paleoecological perspective (2002) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 11, pp. 463-473; Clark, L.A., Pregibon, D., Tree-based models (1992) Statistical Models, pp. 377-419. , T.
