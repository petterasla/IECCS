Many investigators have indicated that unless the original refrigeration system is correspondingly adjusted when using CFC substitutes, the energy efficiency ratio (EER) of the system will decrease. In this paper, the reasons for a decrease in EER are analysed theoretically, and some proposals for increasing EER are put forward. These proposals are used to develop a domestic refrigerator charged with a non-azeotropic mixture of HCFC22/HFC152a as the substitute for the original working fluid, CFC12. The results show that the EER value of the refrigerator charged with this refrigerant mixture is increased by 6.5% compared with that of the same refrigerator charged with CFC12. © 1994.","CFC; efficiency; household refrigerator; mixture; R12; R152a; R22; refrigerating machine; substitute",,,,,,,"Peterson, Thorsell, Comparison of the refrigerants HFC-134a and CFC-12 (1990) Int J Refrig, 13 (3); Kruse, Latest developments and future trends in the field of CFC substitutes (1989) News Letter of the IEA Heat Pump Center, 7 (2); Fischer, CFCs dominate agenda at Chicago (1989) ASHRAE meeting, 7. , News Letter of the IEA Heat Pump Center, 2; Xie, Zhou, Wu, Yang, Zhu, Study of application of mixture refrigerants to small scale refrigeration equipment (1991) J Refrig, (2). , (in Chinese); Miao, (1983) Reciprocating refrigerating compressor, , Machinery Industry Press, (in Chinese); Wu, Han, (1987) Principle and Equipment of Refrigeration, , Xi'an Jiaotong University Press, (in Chinese); Xie, Wu, Predicting the characteristics on capillary tube in case of using mixture (1991) Proc.
