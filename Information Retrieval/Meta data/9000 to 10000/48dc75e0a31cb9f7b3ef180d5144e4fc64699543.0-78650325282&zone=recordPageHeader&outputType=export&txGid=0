Four 2080s scenarios were analysed for 6 European locations, using as a case study fattening pig farms and 3 cooling technologies: natural and forced ventilation, and cooling pads. The climate scenarios were constructed as a combination of general circulation models (Had CM2 and ECHAM4) downscaled for Europe with the HIRHAM and RCA3 regional models and driven by the A2 and B2 socio-economic scenarios. A steady-state heat balance model was used for the energy analysis in the livestock farms. The results showed that no changes in cooling technologies are necessary in the Mediterranean Basin; cooling pads were efficient enough for adequate climatisation both in the present and future scenarios. In northern European locations results were different, depending on the future scenario. Most scenarios indicated that cooling pads will be needed in fattening pig farms in the 2080s, while ventilation is efficient enough in the present scenario. The economic consequences will be important, as the costs associated with cooling pads are much higher than the costs of natural or forced ventilation. © Inter-Research 2010.","Animal houses; Cooling systems; Downscaling; General circulation models","Agricultural buildings; Animal house; Climate scenarios; Climatisation; Cooling pads; Cooling technology; Down-scaling; Economic consequences; Effect of temperature; Energy analysis; Forced ventilation; General circulation model; General circulation models; Global climate changes; Heat balance model; Mediterranean basin; Regional model; Socio-economics; Animals; Climate change; Climate models; Energy management; Farms; Thermoelectric equipment; Ventilation; Cooling systems; animal husbandry; climate change; cooling; farming system; general circulation model; livestock; numerical model; socioeconomic status; temperature effect; ventilation; Europe; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Suidae",,,,,,"Blanes, V., Pedersen, S., Ventilation flow in pig houses measured and calculated by carbon dioxide moisture and heat balance equations (2005) Biosyst Eng., 92, pp. 483-493; Christensen, J.H., Timothy, R.C., Rummukainen, M., Amanatidis, G., Evaluating the performance and utility of regional climate models: The PRUDENCE project (2007) Clim Change, 81, pp. 1-6; (2002) Climatization of Animal Houses.
