Recent studies have warned that global climate change could increase the frequency of coral bleaching and threaten the long-term viability of coral reefs. These assertions are based on projecting the coarse output from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) to the local conditions around representative coral reefs. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive global assessment of coral bleaching under climate change by adapting the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method to the output of a low- and high-climate sensitivity GCM. First, we develop and test algorithms for predicting mass coral bleaching with GCM-resolution sea surface temperatures for thousands of coral reefs, using a global coral reef map and 1985-2002 bleaching prediction data. We then use the algorithms to determine the frequency of coral bleaching and required thermal adaptation by corals and their endosymbionts under two different emissions scenarios. The results indicate that bleaching could become an annual or biannual event for the vast majority of the world's coral reefs in the next 30-50 years without an increase in thermal tolerance of 0.2-1.0°C per decade. The geographic variability in required thermal adaptation found in each model and emissions scenario suggests that coral reefs in some regions, like Micronesia and western Polynesia, may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Advances in modelling and monitoring will refine the forecast for individual reefs, but this assessment concludes that the global prognosis is unlikely to change without an accelerated effort to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Adaptation; Bleaching; Climate change; Coral reefs; General circulation model; Ocean warming; Symbiosis","atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; coral bleaching; coral reef; dinoflagellate; environmental assessment; global climate; oceanic general circulation model; symbiosis; Caroline Islands; Federated States of Micronesia; Micronesia; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Polynesia; Anthozoa; Dinophyceae; Symbiodinium",,,,,,"Ayre, D.J., Hughes, T.P., Climate change, genotypic diversity and gene flow in reef-building corals (2004) Ecology Letters, 7, pp. 273-278; Baird, A.H., Marshall, P.A., Mortality, growth and reproduction in scleractinian corals following bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef (2002) Marine Ecology - Progress Series, 237, pp. 133-141; Baker, A.C., Flexibility and specificity in coral-algal symbiosis: Diversity, ecology, and biogeography of (2003) Symbiodinium Annual Review of Ecology and Evolutionary Systematics, 34, pp. 661-689; Baker, A.C., Starger, C.J., McClanahan, T.R., Coral reefs: Corals' adaptive response to climate change (2004) Nature, 430, p. 741; Berkelmans, R., Time-integrated thermal bleaching thresholds of reefs and their variation on the Great Barrier Reef (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 229, pp. 73-82; Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching: Causes and consequences (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. 129-138; Brown, B.E., Dunne, R.P., Goodson, M.S., Experience shapes the susceptibility of a reef coral to bleaching (2002) Coral Reefs, 21, pp. 119-126; Bryant, D., Burke, L., McManus, J., (1998) Reefs at Risk: A Map-Based Indicator of Threats to the World's Coral Reefs, , World Resources Institute, Washington, DC; Connell, J.H., Hughes, T.P., Wallace, C.C., A 30-year study of coral abundance, recruitment, and disturbance at several scales in space and time (1997) Ecological Monographs, 67, pp. 461-488; Cubasch, U., Meehl, G.A., Boer, G.J., Projections of future climate change (2000) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, pp. 525-582. , (eds Houghton JT et al.)
