Silver perch and rainbow fish were tested at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C, while rainbow trout was tested at 10, 15, 20, and 25°C. Although some trend of increasing amplitudes with increasing temperature was evident; there was no significant temperature response of ventilation frequency rates over time in silver perch pre-exposed to 10 μg L-1 endosulfan for 18 h. The rate of ventilation frequency of rainbow fish pre-exposed to 200 μg L-1 of chlorpyrifos for 96 h was lower in treatments than in the control at 15°C. However, between 20 and 35°C, rates were significantly higher in the treatments than those of the control. In rainbow trout pre-exposed to 100 μg L-1 of chlorpyrifos, the rates of frequency were significantly lower than those of controls in temperatures between 10 and 20°C but higher at 25°C. The amplitude of silver perch seemed to increase with the increase in temperature; however, the corresponding temperature quotient values at various temperature regimes and over exposure time showed no significant differences. The ventilation frequency of rainbow fish and rainbow trout significantly increased at the higher test temperatures, and their corresponding temperature quotient values for both fish also increased at the elevated temperatures. © 2009 SETAC.","Chlorpyrifos; Endosulfan; Fish ventilation; Sublethal; Temperature","Chlorpyrifos; Effects of temperature; Elevated temperature; Endosulfan; Endosulfans; Exposure-time; Frequency rate; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Rainbow trout; Sublethal temperatures; Temperature regimes; Temperature response; Test temperatures; Fish; Frequency response; Insecticides; Meats; Silver; Ventilation; Temperature; chlorpyrifos; endosulfan; chlorpyrifos; dose-response relationship; endosulfan; fish; percid; pollution exposure; salmonid; sublethal effect; temperature effect; ventilation; aquatic environment; article; bidyanus bidyanus; breathing; controlled study; ecotoxicity; ecotoxicology; fish; lethality; melanotaenia duboulayi; nonhuman; perch; priority journal; rainbow trout; respiratory function; temperature sensitivity; Animals; Biosensing Techniques; Chlorpyrifos; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Endosulfan; Fishes; Respiratory Mechanics; Temperature; Bairdiella chrysoura; Bidyanus bidyanus; Melanotaenia duboulayi; Melanotaeniidae; Oncorhynchus mykiss",,"chlorpyrifos, 2921-88-2; endosulfan, 115-29-7; Chlorpyrifos, 2921-88-2; Endosulfan, 115-29-7",,,,"Glover, C.J.M., Adaptations of fishes in arid Australia (1982) Evolution of the Flora and Fauna of Arid Australia, pp. 241-246. , Barker WR, Greenslade PJM, eds, Peacock, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Roessig, J.M., Woodley, C.M., Cech Jr., J.J., Hansen, L.J., Effects of global change on marine and estuarine fishes and fisheries (2004) Rev Fish Biol Fish, 14, pp. 251-275; Ficke, A.D., Myrick, C.A., Hansen, L.J., Potential impacts of global climate change on freshwater fisheries (2007) Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries, 17 (4), pp. 581-613. , DOI 10.1007/s11160-007-9059-5; Stenseth, N.C., Mysterud, A., Otterson, G., Hurrell, J.W., Chan, K.S., Lima, M., Ecological effects of climate fluctuation (2002) Science, 297, pp. 1292-1296; Campbell, C.M., Davies, P.S., Thermal acclimation in the teleost, Blennius pholis (L.)
