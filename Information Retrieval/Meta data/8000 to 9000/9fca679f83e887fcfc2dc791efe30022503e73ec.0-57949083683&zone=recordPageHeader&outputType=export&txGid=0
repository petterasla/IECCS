Box 31, Clayton Campus, 3800 Vic., Australia","This study explores global energy demand, and hydrogen's role, over the 21st century. It considers four illustrative cases: a high (1000 EJ) and a low (300 EJ) energy future, and for each of these conditions, a high (80%) and low (20%) fossil fuel energy share. We argue that neither high energy future is probable, because of resource limitations, and rising energy, environmental and money costs per unit of delivered energy as annual energy demand rises far beyond present levels. The low energy/low fossil case is most likely, followed by the low energy/high fossil case, although both require large cuts in energy use, and most probably, lifestyle changes in high energy use countries. Hydrogen production would be best favoured in the low fossil fuel options, with production both greater, and implemented earlier, in the higher energy case. It is thus least likely in the low energy/high fossil fuel case. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Carbon capture and storage; Energy consumption; Global warming; Hydrogen; Renewable energy","Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas fuel manufacture; Global warming; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Military operations; Nonmetals; 21st centuries; Carbon capture and storage; Energy consumption; Energy demands; Energy futures; Energy uses; Fossil fuel energies; Fuel options; Global energy demands; High energies; Renewable energy; Resource limitations; Renewable energy resources",,,,,,"BP, (2008) BP Statistical review of world energy 2008, , BP, London; International Energy Agency (IEA), (2006) Key world energy statistics 2006, , IEA/OECD, Paris; Energy Information Administration (EIA), (2007) International energy outlook, , http://www.eia.doe/gov/oiaf/ieo/pdf/0484(2007).pdf, US Department of Energy Available from:; United Nations (UN), (2006) UN world population prospects, the 2006 revision, , http://esa.un.org/unpp, [accessed 07.04.08]; Riahi, K., Grubler, A., Nakicenovic, N., Scenarios of long-term socio-economic and environmental development under climate stabilization (2007) Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 74, pp. 887-935; Lincoln, S.F., Fossil fuels in the 21st century (2005) Ambio, 34 (8), pp. 621-627; Hoffert, M.I., Caldiera, K., Benford, G., Crisswell, D.R., Green, C., Herzog, H., Advanced technology paths to global climate stability: energy for the greenhouse planet (2002) Science, 298, pp. 981-987; Momirlan, M., Veziroglu, T.N., The properties of hydrogen as fuel tomorrow in sustainable energy system for a cleaner planet (2005) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 30, pp. 795-802; Marban, G., Valdes-Solis, T., Towards the hydrogen economy?
