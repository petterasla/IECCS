However, future impacts on ecosystem health, and on the health of humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, are much less well understood. Evidence of increasing frequency of extreme weather events (the 2003 trans-European heat wave, extended droughts in Australia and South America), of geographic changes in vector-borne disease (bluetongue and hanta viruses emerging in northern Europe, dengue virus expanding in central and northern America), and of altered animal behavioral responses (changes in bird migration patterns and fishery numbers) warrants action. To make valid choices, however, practitioners and decision makers must understand what is known about GCC and what is only theory. There will be a multitude of microbial, vector, and host responses to climate change, for example, and not all organisms will respond similarly or across equal time scales. Unfortunately, for many organisms and ecosystems the scientific community has a relatively poor understanding of current effectors and balances, making it problematic to describe the current situation, let alone to validate future predictions. The need for enhanced basic research and systematic surveillance programs is obvious, but putting such programs into place is daunting. However, the threats are real and fast approaching. What is done in the next few years may be decisive, whether for the good or the ill of all. © The American College of Veterinary Pathologists 2010.","Animal health; Disease emergence; Ecosystem health; Global climate change; Public health","Animalia; Aves; Dengue virus; animal; animal disease; article; climate change; communicable disease; domestic animal; ecosystem; health; human; wild animal; Animal Diseases; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Animals, Wild; Climate Change; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Ecosystem; Humans; World Health",,,,,,"Alto, B.W., Kesavaraju, B., Juliano, S.A., Lounibos, L.P., Stage-dependent predation on competitors: Consequences for the outcome of a mosquito invasion (2009) J Anim Ecol, 78, pp. 928-936. , doi:10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01558.x; Anderson, P.K., Cunningham, A.A., Patel, N.G., Morales, F.J., Epstein, P.R., Daszak, P., Emerging infectious diseases of plants: Pathogen pollution, climate change and agrotechnology drivers (2004) Trends Ecol Evol, 19, pp. 535-544; Aydinalp, C., Cresser, M.S., The effects of global climate change on agriculture (2008) Am Eurasian J Agric Environ Sci, 3, pp. 672-676; Campbell-Lendrum, D., Corvalan, C., Neira, M., Global climate change: Implications for international public health policy (2007) Bull World Health Org, 85, pp. 161-244. , http://www.who.int/entity/bulletin/volumes/85/3/06-039503/en/index.html, 2009, Accessed 12 May; Cao, L., Caldeira, K., Atmospheric CO2 stabilization and ocean acidification (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35, pp. L19609; Cassis, G., Biodiversity loss: A human health issue [editorial] (1998) Med J Aust, 169, pp. 568-569. , http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/xmas98/cassis/cassis, 2009, Accessed 12 May; Clement, J., Vercauteren, J., Verstraeten, W.W., Ducoffre, G., Barrios, J.M., Vandamme, A.M., Maes, P., van Ranst, M., Relating increasing hantavirus incidences to the changing climate: The mast connection Int J Health Geogr, 8, pp. 1-11. , 2009; Pachauri, R.K., Reisinger, A., (2007) Climate Change 2007 Synthesis Report: Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC, pp. 30+46. , Core Writing Group, and 46.
