In urban areas of Nagoya, Japan (35°10'N, 136°55'E), where there is much anthropogenic influence, evidence of methane release into the atmosphere has been reported. Variations in the carbon isotopic composition were analyzed with diurnal fluctuation of atmospheric CH4 concentration, since the diurnal increase in the CH4 concentration is attributed mainly to release from local sources. In November and December 1993, the contribution of fossil CH4 to local CH4 released from the urban area was calculated to be 102 ± 8%, and its δ13C was -40.8 ± 3.0‰. Leakage of supplied natural gas and exhaust gas from automobiles would be important CH4 sources in the urban area in late autumn to winter. In suburban areas in Japan there are many rice paddy fields, and these are one kind of major anthropagenic source of atmospheric CH4. In a suburban area of Nagoya fossil, CH4 contributed to less than 10% of local release in July and August 1994. The calculated value of δ13C for non-fossil CH4 was approximately -65‰, which is within the range of reported values of δ13C for CH4 derived from bacterial CH4 sources such as irrigated rice paddies.","Accelerator mass spectrometry; Carbon-13; Carbon-14; Global warming","Accelerator mass spectrometry; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Carbon; Exhaust gases; Global warming; Isotopes; Mass spectrometry; Methane; Natural gas; Air pollution; carbon; carbon 13; carbon 14; methane; biogeochemical cycle; isotopic composition; methane; suburban area; urban area; air monitoring; air pollution; article; circadian rhythm; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; isotope labeling; japan; priority journal; rice; urban area; winter; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon 13, 14762-74-4; carbon 14, 14762-75-5; methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Bowman, S., (1990) Radiocarbon Dating, p. 21. , London, UK: British Museum Publications; Butterweck, G., Reineking, A., Kesten, J., Porstendörfer, J., The use of the natural radioactive noble gases radon and thoron as tracers for the study of turbulent exchange in the atmospheric boundary layer - Case study in and above a wheat field (1994) Atmospheric Environment, 28, pp. 1963-1969; Cicerone, R.J., Oremland, R.S., Biogeochemical aspects of atmospheric methane (1988) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 2, pp. 299-327; Craig, H., Isotopic standards for carbon and oxygen and correction factors for mass-spectrometric analysis of carbon dioxide (1957) Geochimica Cosmochimica Acta, 12, pp. 133-149; Dai, K.-M., Qian, Y.-N., Fan, C.Y., Bomb-produced 14C in tree rings (1992) Radiocarbon, 34, pp. 753-756; Dlugokencky, E.J., Steele, L.P., Lang, P.M., Masarie, K.A., The growth rate and distribution of atmospheric methane (1994) Journal of Geophysical Research, 99, pp. 17021-17043; Eisma, R., Van Der Borg, K., De Jong, A.F.M., Kieskamp, W.M., Veltkamp, A.C., Measurements of the 14C content of atmospheric methane in The Netherlands to determine the regional emissions of 14CH4 (1994) Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, 92, pp. 410-412; Eisma, R., Vermeulen, A.T., Van Der Borg, K., 14CH4 emissions from nuclear power plants in northwestern Europe (1995) Radiocarbon, 37, pp. 475-483; Etheridge, D.M., Pearman, G.I., Fraser, P.J., Changes in tropospheric methane between 1841 and 1978 from a high accumulation-rate Antarctic ice core (1992) Tellus, 44, pp. 282-294; Fujii, H., Morishima, A., (1994) Directory of Nuclear Power Plants in the World 1994, p. 113. , Tokyo, Japan: Japan Nuclear Energy Information Center; Fung, I., John, J., Lerner, J., Matthews, E., Prather, M., Steele, L.P., Fraser, P.J., Three-dimensional model synthesis of the global methane cycle (1991) Journal of Geophysical Research, 96, pp. 13033-13065; Grootes, P.M., Farwell, G.W., Schmidt, F.H., Leach, D.D., Stuiver, M., (1987) Rapid Response of Tree Cellulose Radiocarbon Content to Changes in Atmospheric 14CO2 Concentration, , US DOE: Report DOE/ER/40048-203-L7; Jacobi, W., André, K., The vertical distribution of radon 222, radon 220 and their decay products in the atmosphere (1963) Journal of Geophysical Research, 68, pp. 3799-3814; Kitagawa, H., Masuzawa, T., Nakamura, T., Matsumoto, E., A batch preparation method for graphite targets with low background for AMS 14C measurements (1993) Radiocarbon, 35, pp. 295-300; Kunz, C., Carbon-14 discharge at three light-water reactors (1985) Health Physics, 49, pp. 25-35; Lowe, D.C., Brenninkmeijer, C.A.M., Manning, M.R., Sparks, R., Wallace, G., Radiocarbon determination of atmospheric methane at Baring Head, New Zealand (1988) Nature, 332, pp. 522-525; Lowe, D.C., Brenninkmeijer, C.A.M., Tyler, S.C., Dlugkencky, E.J., Determination of the isotopic composition of atmospheric methane and its application in the Antarctic (1991) Journal of Geophysical Research, 96, pp. 15455-15467; Lowe, D.C., Brenninkmeijer, C.A.M., Manning, M.R., Brailsford, G.W., Lassey, K.R., Gomez, A.J., Carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric methane in New Zealand and Antarctica (1993) Proceedings of An International Symposiumon Isotope Techniques in the Study of Past and Current Environmental Changes in the Hydrosphere and the Atmosphere, pp. 43-51. , Vienna: International Atomic Energy Agency.
