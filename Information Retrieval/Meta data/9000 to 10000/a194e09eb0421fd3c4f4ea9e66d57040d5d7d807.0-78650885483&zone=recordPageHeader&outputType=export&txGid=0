Thus, organisms need to employ effective mechanisms to ensure survival under stressful thermal conditions, among which phenotypic plasticity is considered a particularly quick and effective one. Methodology/Principal Findings:In a series of experiments we here investigate phenotypic adjustment in temperature stress resistance following environmental manipulations in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Cooler compared to warmer acclimation temperatures generally increased cold but decreased heat stress resistance and vice versa. In contrast, short-time hardening responses revealed more complex patterns, with, e.g., cold stress resistance being highest at intermediate hardening temperatures. Adult food stress had a negative effect on heat but not on cold stress resistance. Additionally, larval feeding treatment showed interactive effects with adult feeding for heat but not for cold stress resistance, indicating that nitrogenous larval resources may set an upper limit to performance under heat stress. In contrast to expectations, cold resistance slightly increased during the first eight days of adult life. Light cycle had marginal effects on temperature stress resistance only, with cold resistance tending to be higher during daytime and thus active periods. Conclusions/Significance: Our results highlight that temperature-induced plasticity provides an effective tool to quickly and strongly modulate temperature stress resistance, and that such responses are readily reversible. However, resistance traits are not only affected by ambient temperature, but also by, e.g., food availability and age, making their measurement challenging. The latter effects are largely underexplored and deserve more future attention. Owing to their magnitude, plastic responses in thermal tolerance should be incorporated into models trying to forecast effects of global change on extant biodiversity. © 2010 Fischer et al.",,"animal experiment; article; Bicyclus anynana; butterfly; cold acclimatization; cold exposure; cold stress; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental stress; environmental temperature; feeding behavior; female; food availability; heat acclimatization; heat stress; larval development; light dark cycle; male; nonhuman; phenotypic plasticity; sex difference; survival rate; temperature acclimatization; temperature stress; animal; animal behavior; biodiversity; butterfly; climate; cold; environment; genetics; heat; insect; larva; phenotype; physiology; temperature; Bicyclus anynana; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Biodiversity; Butterflies; Climate; Cold Temperature; Environment; Female; Hot Temperature; Larva; Male; Phenotype; Pupa; Sex Factors; Temperature",,,,,,"Willmer, P., Stone, G., Johnston, I.A., (2000) Environmental Physiology of Animals, , Oxford: Blackwell; Bijlsma, R., Loeschcke, V., Environmental stress, adaptation and evolution: An overview (2000) J Evol Biol, 18, pp. 744-749; Marshall, K.E., Sinclair, B.J., Repeated stress exposure results in a survival-reproduction trade-off in Drosophila melanogaster (2010) Proc R Soc Lond B, 277, pp. 963-969; Clarke, A., Costs and consequences of evolutionary temperature adaptation (2003) Trends Ecol Evol, 18, pp. 573-581; Hoffmann, A.A., Sørensen, J.G., Loeschcke, V., Adaptation of Drosophila to temperature extremes: Bringing together quantitative and molecular approaches (2003) J Therm Biol, 28, pp. 175-216; Sinclair, B.J., Vernon, P., Klok, C.J., Chown, S.L., Insects at low temperatures: An ecological perspective (2003) Trends Ecol Evol, 18, pp. 257-262; Sørensen, J.G., Norry, F.M., Scannapieco, A.C., Loeschcke, V., Altitudinal variation for stress resistance traits and thermal adaptation in adult Drosophila buzzatii from the New World (2005) J Evol Biol, 18, pp. 829-837; Dahlhoff, E.P., Rank, N.E., The role of stress proteins in responses of a montane willow leaf beetle to environmental temperature variation (2007) J Biosci, 32, pp. 477-488; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Pal, J.S., Trapp, R.J., Giorgi, F., Fine-scale processes regulate the response of extreme events to global climate change (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 102, pp. 15774-15778; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Pal, J.S., Giorgi, F., Gao, X., Heat stress intensification in the Mediterranean climate change hotspot (2007) Geophysical Research Letters, 34, pp. L11706; Sala, O.E., Chapin, F.S., Armesto, J.J., Berlow, E., Bloomfield, J., Biodiversity: Global biodiversity scenarios for the year 2100 (2000) Science, 287, pp. 1770-1774; Thomas, C.D., Cameron, A., Green, R.E., Bakkenes, M., Beaumont, L.J., Extinction risk from climate change (2004) Nature, 427, pp. 145-148; Deutsch, C.A., Tewksbury, J.J., Huey, R.B., Sheldon, K.S., Ghalambor, C.K., Impacts of climate warming on terrestrial ectotherms across latitude (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 105, pp. 6668-6672; Sørensen, J.G., Kristensen, T.N., Loeschcke, V., The evolutionary and ecological role of heat shock proteins (2003) Ecol Lett, 6, pp. 1025-1037; Chown, S.L., Terblanche, J.S., Phyiological diversity in insects: Ecological and evolutionary contexts (2007) Adv Insect Physiol, 33, pp. 50-152; Bradshaw, A.D., Evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in plants (1965) Adv Genet, 13, pp. 115-155; Pigliucci, M., (2001) Phenotypic Plasticity: Beyond Nature and Nurture, , Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press; Lee, R.E., Chen, C.-P., Denlinger, D.L., A rapid cold-hardening process in insects (1987) Science, 238, pp. 1415-1417; Sejerkilde, M., Sørensen, J.G., Loeschcke, V., Effects of cold- and heat hardening on thermal resistance in Drosophila melanogaster (2003) J Insect Physiol, 49, pp. 719-726; Kellett, M., Hoffmann, A.A., McKechnie, S.W., Hardening capacity in the Drosophila melanogaster species group is constrained by basal thermotolerance (2005) Funct Ecol, 19, pp. 853-858; Marais, E., Terblanche, J.S., Chown, S.L., Life stage-related differences in hardening and acclimation of thermal tolerance traits in the kelp fly, Paratora dreuxi (Diptera, Helcomyzidae) (2009) J Insect Physiol, 55, pp. 336-343; Wilson, R.S., Franklin, C.E., Testing the beneficial acclimation hypothesis (2002) Trends Ecol Evol, 17, pp. 66-70; Zeilstra, I., Fischer, K., Cold tolerance in relation to developmental and adult temperature in a butterfly (2003) Physiol Entomol, 30, pp. 92-95; Deere, J.A., Sinclair, B.J., Marshall, D.J., Chown, S.L., Phynotypic plasticity of thermal tolerances in five oribatid mite species from sub-Antarctic Marion Island (2006) J Insect Physiol, 52, pp. 693-700; Geister, T.L., Fischer, K., Testing the beneficial acclimation hypothesis: Cool males - hot love?
