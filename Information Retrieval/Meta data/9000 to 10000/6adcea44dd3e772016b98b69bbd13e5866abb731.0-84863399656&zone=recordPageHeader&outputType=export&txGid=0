To combat these threats, bioethanol and biodiesel are being produced as alternative fuel sources. A wide range of substances can be used for bioethanol production. Biofuel in form of bioethanol can be produced using agricultural wastes by the use of enzymes, and hence the main objective of this approach is to get benefit of the agricultural wastes. The basic steps included in ethanol production from agricultural wastes composed of milling/grinding, cooking, saccharification, fermentation, purification/distillation and the last step is hydration. In every step, there are various strategies to increase bioethanol production and its usefulness. Bioethanol fuel obtained from starchy and lignocelluloses agricultural biomass is being gradually improved to minimize the use of petroleum due to decrease in the petroleum resources, and to diminish the effect of petrol on the environment. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Alternative fuel sources; Bioethanol; Fermentation","bioethanol; fuel; unclassified drug; agricultural waste; alcohol production; biomass fermentation; biotechnological production; distillation; enzymatic degradation; grinding; hydration; Pakistan; process optimization; renewable energy; review; saccharification",,,,,,"Bin, Y., Yanpin, L., Perspective The promise of cellulosic ethanol production in China (2007) J.
