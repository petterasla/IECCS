However, what does globalization imply for the cooperation needed to address such global social dilemmas? Two competing hypotheses are offered. One hypothesis is that global ization prompts reactionary movements that reinforce parochial distinctions among people. Large-scale cooperation then focuses on favoring one's own ethnic, racial, or language group. The alternative hypothesis suggests that globalization strengthens cosmopolitan attitudes by weakening the relevance of ethnicity, locality, or nationhood as sources of identification. In essence, globalization, the increasing interconnectedness of people worldwide, broadens the group boundaries within which individuals perceive they belong. We test these hypotheses by measuring globalization at both the country and individual levels and analyzing the relationship between globalization and individual co-operation with distal others in multilevel sequential cooperation experiments in which players can contribute to individual, local, and/or global accounts. Our samples were drawn from the general populations of the United States, Italy, Russia, Argentina, South Africa, and Iran. We find that as country and individual levels of globalization increase, so too does individual cooperation at the global level vis-a-vis the local level. In essence, ''globalized'' individuals draw broader group boundaries than others, eschewing parochial motivations in favor of cosmopolitan ones. Globalization may thus be fundamental in shaping contemporary large-scale cooperation and may be a positive force toward the provision of global public goods.","Cosmopolitanism; Economic experiments; Parochialism; Public goods provision; Social dilemmas","article; awareness; cooperation; environmental protection; ethnicity; global change; motivation; priority journal; social problem; Humans; International Cooperation; Interpersonal Relations; Motivation; Social Change",,,,,,"Kerr, R., Global warming is changing the world (2007) Science, 316, pp. 188-190; Dietz, T., Ostrom, E., Stern, P., The struggle to govern the commons (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1907-1912; Pretty, J., Social capital and the collective management of resources (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1912-1914; Milinski, M., Sommerfeld, R., Krambeck, H.-J., Reed, F., Marotzke, J., The collective-risk social dilemma and the prevention of simulated dangerous climate change (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 2291-2294; Milinski, M., Semmann, D., Krambeck, H.-J., Marotzke, J., Stabilizing the Earth's climate is not a losing game: Supporting evidence from public goods experiments (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 3994-3998; Dreber, A., Nowak, M.A., Gambling for global goods (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 2261-2262; Tomlinson, J., Proximity politics (2000) Inform Communic Society, 3, pp. 402-414; Guillen, M., Is globalization civilizing, destructive or feeble?
