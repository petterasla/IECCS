Environmental input-output analysis (EIOA) is used to evaluate their air pollutant emissions and energy consumptions. The global warming potential and the emissions of carbon monoxide and of volatile organic compounds from the WNS are less than those from the CWS because of the decrease in the consumption of industrial water, while the emissions of sulfur dioxide and of nitrogen oxides and energy consumption from the WNS are greater because of the increase in electricity consumption for pumping. For perfectly environmentally-friendly water reuse, electricity consumption should be constrained or optimized in water network synthesis, and primary energy mix for electricity generation should be shifted towards renewable energy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Environmental input-output analysis; Life cycle assessment; Supply chains; Water network system; Water reuse","Air pollutant emission; Electricity generation; Electricity-consumption; Energy consumption; Energy performance; Environmental input-output analysis; Environmentally-friendly; Global warming potential; Industrial water; Input output analysis; Life cycle assessment; Primary energy mix; Renewable energies; Water network system; Water networks; Water reuse; Water system; Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Constrained optimization; Electric generators; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Renewable energy resources; Salvaging; Statistics; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Volatile organic compounds; Water analysis; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Wastewater reclamation; carbon monoxide; fresh water; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; electricity generation; emission; energy use; global warming; life cycle analysis; recycling; water supply; water use; air pollutant; article; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; electricity; energy consumption; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; intermethod comparison; life cycle assessment; renewable energy; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; water supply",,"carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5",,,,"Bagajewicz, M., A review of recent design procedures for water networks in refineries and process plants (2000) Computers & Chemical Engineering, 24, pp. 2093-2113; Cicas, G., Hendrickson, C.T., Horvath, A., Matthews, H.S., A regional version of a US economic input-output life-cycle assessment model (2007) International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 12 (6), pp. 365-372. , DOI 10.1065/lca2007.04.318; Cicas Matthews G, H.S., Hendrickson, C., (2006) The 1997 Benchmark Version of the Economic Input-output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) Model, , http://www.eiolca.net, accessed 2008; Donnelly, K., Beckett-Furnell, Z., Traeger, S., Okrasinski, T., Holman, S., Eco-design implemented through a product-based environmental management system (2006) Journal of Cleaner Production, 14, pp. 1357-1367; El-Halwagi, M.M., Gabriel, F., Harell, D., Rigorous graphical targeting for resource conservation via material recycle/reuse networks (2003) Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 42 (19), pp. 4319-4328; Erol, P., Thoming, J., ECO-design of reuse and recycling networks by multi-objective optimization (2005) Journal of Cleaner Production, 13, pp. 1492-1503; (2005) GAMS, A User Guide, , GAMS Development Corporation.
