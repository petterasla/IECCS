The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recently confirmed that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal; meanwhile, an effort is under way to develop a successor to the Kyoto Protocol and provide a roadmap towards the lower carbon world of the future. On the other hand, biomass energy refers to the use of plant and other organic materials to provide desired forms of energy and energy services, such as heat, light, and motive power. Since the discovery of fire, it has beena major source of energy worldwide. Even in today's fossil fuel era, biomass provides about 11% of the world's total primary energy supply. Biomass is the major source of energy in rural regions of the developing countries. Biomass is used to meet a variety of energy needs, including generating electricity, heating homes, fueling vehicles, and providing process heat for industrial facilities.
