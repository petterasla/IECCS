To determine the influence of externally-driven, physical factors on spatial and temporal patterns of water quality in the two lakes, meteorological, hydrological, and water quality data were collected over 1 year. Multivariate analyses indicated that wind energy was driving the main water quality gradient in the lakes, which was primarily related to wind-induced resuspension of lake sediments. The major, seasonally regulated, non-tidal freshwater inflow was important in determining nutrient and salinity gradients in the lakes. The main nutrient inputs to the system were identified as the regulated, non-tidal inflow (the upper Waipori River) and the tidal inflow (lower Waipori River). The impact of water quality gradients on zooplankton community structure in the lakes was assessed by canonical multivariate methods. Salinity gradients, caused by seasonal saltwater intrusions, were strongly related to zooplankton community structure in the lakes. Nutrient gradients (indicative of trophic state) were also related to zooplankton community structure. Although wind-induced sediment resuspension had the largest impact on water quality in the lakes, it had little impact on the zooplankton community structure in either lake. The relationships between water quality and zooplankton community structure were confounded in Lake Waipori because of its very short hydraulic residence time (annual mean = 1.9 days). Zooplankton community structure was resilient to short-term changes in suspended particulate matter concentrations but not to seasonal changes in salinity. The results of this study support others which have shown impacts of even relatively small variations in salinity on the structure of zooplankton communities. This highlights the vulnerability of zooplankton communities in coastal lakes and wetlands to increasing salinity resulting from sea level rise and global climate change.","CCA; Community structure; Lake; Multivariate; Nutrients; Resilience; Salinity; Sediment resuspension; Stress; Tidal; Water quality; Zooplankton","community structure; lake ecosystem; water quality; wetland; zooplankton; New Zealand",,,,,,"Attayde, J.L., Bozelli, R.L., Assessing the indicator properties of zooplankton assemblages to disturbance gradients by canonical correspondence analysis (1998) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 55, pp. 1789-1797; Bloesch, J., Mechanisms, measurement and importance of sediment resuspension in lakes (1995) Marine and Freshwater Research, 46, pp. 295-304; Blom, G., Van Duin, E.H.S., Lijklema, L., Sediment resuspension and light conditions in some shallow Dutch lakes (1994) Water Science and Technology, 30, pp. 243-252; Chapman, M.A., Lewis, M.H., (1976) An Introduction to the Freshwater Crustacea of New Zealand, , Auckland, William Collins New Zealand Ltd; Cuthbert, I., Del Giorgio, P., Toward a standard method of measuring color in freshwater (1992) Limnology and Oceanography, 37, pp. 1319-1326; Frey, D.G., The penetration of cladocerans into saline waters (1993) Hydrobiologia, 267, pp. 233-248; Gons, H.J., Otten, J.H., Rijkeboer, M., The significance of wind resuspension for the predominance of filamentous cyanobacteria in a shallow, eutrophic lake (1991) Memorie dell'Istituto di Idrobiologia, 48, pp. 233-249; Green, J., Associations of planktonic and periphytic rotifers in a Malaysian estuary and two nearby ponds (1995) Hydrobiologia, 313-314, pp. 47-56; Greenwald, G.M., Hurlbert, S.H., Microcosm analysis of salinity effects on coastal lagoon plankton assemblages (1993) Hydrobiologia, 267, pp. 307-335; Hamilton, D.P., Mitchell, S.F., An empirical model for sediment resuspension in shallow lakes (1996) Hydrobiologia, 317, pp. 209-220; Hamilton, D.P., Mitchell, S.F., Wave-induced shear stress, plant nutrients and chlorophyll in seven shallow lakes (1997) Freshwater Biology, 38, pp. 159-168; Hart, R.C., Observations on calanoid diet, seston, phytoplankton-zooplankton relationships, and inferences on calanoid food limitation in a siltladen reservoir (1987) Archiv für Hydrobiologie, 111, pp. 67-82; Hawley, N., Lesht, B.M., Sediment resuspension in Lake St. Clair (1992) Limnology and Oceanography, 37, pp. 1720-1737; Jack, J.D., Wickham, S.A., Toalson, S., Gilbert, J.J., The effect of clays on a freshwater plankton community: An enclosure experiment (1993) Archiv für Hydrobiologie, 127, pp. 257-270; Jeppesen, E., Søndergaard, M., Kanstrup, E., Petersen, B., Eriksen, R.B., Hammershøj, M., Mortensen, E., Have, A., Does the impact of nutrients on the biological structure and function of brackish and freshwater lakes differ?
