Among them, nuclear energy utilization is found to have a large CO2 reduction potential, i.e., from 10% reduction of the total emission in 1990 to the levels of 16%, 21% and 42% in years 2000, 2010 and 2030, respectively, through electric power generation and process heat application.",,"Air Pollution - Gaseous Effluents; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Nuclear Energy; Emission Reduction; Software Package MARKAL; Carbon Dioxide",,,,,,,"Yasukawa, Shigeru",,,,,,,,00047120,,NGEGA,,"Japanese","Nippon Genshiryoku Gakkaishi",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026382917
