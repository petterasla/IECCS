Relative radiative forcing calculations have been performed using these data in order to determine the global warming potential of the particular species. The relative forcing (compared to CFC11, per volume) increases with molecular weight in the above series from 0.47 to 2.1, the GWP for a time horizon of 100 yrs from 1.1 to 4.7. This corresponds to a GWP on CO2 basis per mass of about 5000. -Authors",,"fluorocarbon; global warming; infrared band intensity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028869192
