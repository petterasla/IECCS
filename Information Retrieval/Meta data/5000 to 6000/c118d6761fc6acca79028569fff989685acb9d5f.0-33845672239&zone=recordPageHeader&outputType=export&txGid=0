The southern edges of ranges in mountain species may not shift northwards during warming as populations instead migrate up available elevational gradients; overall latitudinal range appears therefore to expand. In contrast, flatland species should shift range centroids northwards but not expand or contract their latitudinal range extent. These hypotheses were tested utilizing Late Pleistocene and modern occurrence data. Location: North America. Methods: The location and elevation of modern and Late Pleistocene species occurrences were collected from data bases for 26 species living in mountain or flatland environments. Regressions of elevation change over latitude, and southern and northern range edges were calculated for each species for modern and fossil data sets. A combination of regressions and anova s were used to test whether flatland species shift range edges and latitudinal extents more than mountain species do. Results: Flatland species had significantly larger northward shifts at southern range edges than did mountain-dwelling species from the Late Pleistocene to the present. There was also a significant negative correlation between the amount of change in the latitude of the southern edge of the range and the amount of elevational shifting from the Late Pleistocene to the present. Although significant, only c. 25% of the variance could be explained by this relationship. In addition, there was a weak indication that overall range expansion was less in flatland-dwelling than in mountain-dwelling species. Main conclusions: The approach used here was to examine past species' range responses to warming that occurred after the last ice ages as a means to better predict potential future responses to continued warming. The results confirm predictions of differential southern edge and overall range shifts for species occupying mountain and flatland regions in North America. The findings may be broadly applicable in other regions, thus allowing better modelling of future range and distribution related responses. © 2006 The Author Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate variability; Elevational gradients; Faunmap; Globa lwarming; Latitudinal gradients; Species climate response; Species elevation distribution; Species range","climate effect; climate variation; fossil; global warming; Pleistocene; population distribution; rangeland; species occurrence; North America; Mammalia",,,,,,"Barnosky, A.D., Hadly, E.A., Bell, C.J., Mammalian response to global warming on varied temporal scales (2003) Journal of Mammalogy, 84, pp. 354-368; Brown, J.H., Macroecology: Progress and prospect (1999) Oikos, 87, pp. 3-14; Davis, M.B., Shaw, R.G., Range shifts and adaptive responses to Quaternary climate change (2001) Science, 292, pp. 673-679; Dunn, P.O., Winkler, D., Climate change has affected the breeding date of tree swallows throughout North America (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 266, pp. 2487-2490; Flebbe, P.A., A regional view of the margin: Salmonid abundance and distribution in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Virginia (1994) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 123, pp. 657-667; Gaston, K.J., (2003) The Structure and Dynamics of Geographic Ranges, , Oxford University Press, New York; Graham, R., Spatial response of mammals to late-Quaternary environmental fluctuations (1996) Science, 272, pp. 1601-1606. , Faunmap Working Group; Graham, R.W., Lundelius Jr., E.L., FAUNMAP: A database documenting Late Quaternary distributions of mammal species in the United States (1994) Illinois State Museum, Scientific Papers, 25 (1-2); Grayson, D.K., A brief history of Great Basin pikas (2005) Journal of Biogeography, 32, pp. 2103-2111; Guralnick, R.P., The legacy of past climate and landscape change on species'current experienced climate and elevation ranges across latitude: A multispecies study utilizing mammals in western North America Global Ecology and Biogeography, , (in press a) doi: 10.1111/j.1466-822x.2006.00231.x; Guralnick, R.P., Do flatland and mountain dwelling species show different structuring of their experienced environment over latitude?
