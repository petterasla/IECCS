Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are emitted due to refrigerant leakage (direct emissions) and due to the energy consumed by MACs operation (indirect emissions). In response to reducing the global warming impact of MACs, policy makers and the industry are investigating alternative refrigerant systems that use low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants. The GREEN-MAC-LCCP model assesses the direct and indirect CO2 equivalent emissions related to MACs usage, as well as those associated with the production, use and disposal of alternative refrigerants and MACs components. This model provides a platform for simple data input and provides an output summary as well as details that can be analyzed in a custom fashion by the user. It provides engineers and policy makers a state-of-the-art tool, based on sound engineering data and methods, in order to facilitate the process of evaluating alternate refrigerants with low lifecycle global warming impact as well as providing the total impact of any MACs on the environment. It has been recognized as the standard of the MACs industry. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Alternative refrigerant; Data input; Developed countries; Direct emissions; Engineering data; Global warming impact; Global warming potential; Mobile air conditioning; Policy makers; Vehicle fleets; Decision making; Developing countries; Fleet operations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Refrigerants; carbon dioxide; air conditioning; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; environmental impact; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; policy making; air conditioning; article; climate; controlled study; engineering; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle; motor vehicle; policy; sound; Air Pollutants; Climate Change; Models, Theoretical; Vehicle Emissions",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Air Pollutants; Vehicle Emissions",,,,"http://wardsauto.com/, Wards Automotive Data, 2008.
