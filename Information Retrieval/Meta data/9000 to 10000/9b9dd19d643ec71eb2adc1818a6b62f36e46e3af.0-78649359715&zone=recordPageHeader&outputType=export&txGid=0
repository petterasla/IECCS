Previous building research has often overlooked the construction phase and focused on the material and use phases, discounting the significant environmental impacts of construction. The research was conducted using life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, which is a systematic environmental management tool that holistically analyzes and assesses the environmental impacts of a product or process. Life-cycle inventory results focused on particulate matter, global warming potential, SOx, NOx, CO, Pb, nonmethane volatile organic compounds, energy usage, and solid and liquid wastes. Results over the entire building life cycle indicate that construction, while not as significant as the use phase, is as important as other life-cycle stages. This research used augmented process-based hybrid LCA to model the construction phase; this modeling approach effectively combined process and input-output (IO) LCA. One contribution was the development of a hybrid LCA model for construction, which can be extended to other sectors, such as building products. Including IO results, especially construction service sectors, is critical in construction LCA modeling. Results of a case study demonstrated that services had the highest level of methane emissions and were a significant contributor to CO2 emissions. © 2010 ASCE.","Construction; Environmental issues; Life cycle","Building life cycle; Building products; Combined process; Commercial building; Construction phase; Construction process; Construction services; Energy usage; Environmental issues; Environmental management tool; Global warming potential; Input-output; Life Cycle Inventory; Life cycle stages; Life-cycle assessments; Liquid wastes; Methane emissions; Modeling approach; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; Particulate Matter; Use Phase; Using life; Construction industry; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Global warming; Lead; Lead compounds; Methane; Office buildings; Research; Volatile organic compounds; Life cycle; building construction; emission control; environmental impact assessment; environmental issue; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental research; global warming; life cycle analysis",,,,,,"(2008) Athena impact indicator (version 4.0), , Athena Institute [computer software], Ont Canada; (2001) Idemat database manual, , Delft Univ. of Technology , Delft, The Netherlands; Frischknecht, R., Jungbluth, N., (2001), Database manual, the ETH-ESU 96 Library, ESU-Services and PRe Consultants, Vster, SwitzerlandGuggemos, A., Horvath, A., Strategies of extended producer responsibility for buildings (2003) J.
