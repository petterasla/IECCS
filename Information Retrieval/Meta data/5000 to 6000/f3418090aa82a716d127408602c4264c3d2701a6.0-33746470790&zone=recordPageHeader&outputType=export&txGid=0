To understand the mechanism of seasonal occurrence of this insect pest, we developed a population dynamics model that explicitly incorporates the temperature-dependent development of the pest. The model predictions were compared with observed captures in pheromone traps at the experimental site of the Kagoshima Tea Experiment Research Station in Japan. The results showed that the emergence timing of the insect pest observed in the field was determined primarily by temperature. The relationship between the timing of adult emergence and the leaf damage level was also studied using a logistic regression model. The infestation level decreased as the interval between the adult peak emergence date and the date of tea plucking increased, implying that asynchrony between plant phenology and emergence of the insect pest is a critical factor reducing damage level. We examined how the damage level changes according to global warming. Increased temperature made the timing of insect appearance forward and enhance asynchrony of plant-pest phenology. Therefore, reduction of damage level by the insect pest is expected under global warming. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2005.","Global warming; Population dynamics; Synchrony of plant-pest phenology; Tea pest; Temperature-dependent development","emergence; insect; pest damage; pheromone trap; population dynamics; population modeling; tea; temperature effect; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Kagoshima [Kyushu]; Kyushu; Caloptilia; Gracillariinae; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Tortricidae",,,,,,"Allen, J.C., A modified sine wave method for calculating degree days (1976) Environ Entomol, 5, pp. 388-396; Baskerville, G.L., Emin, P., Rapid estimation of heat accumulation from maximum and minimum temperatures (1969) Ecology, 50, pp. 514-517; Bloomfield, P., (1976) Fourier Analysis of Time Series: An Introduction, , John Wiley and Sons, New York; Brooks, D.H., DEcision Support System for Arable Crops (DESSAC): An integrated approach to decision support (1998) Proceedings of the Brighton Conference on Pests and Diseases (BCPD), pp. 239-246. , Council BCP (ed) Brighton, 1998; Buse, A., Good, J.E.G., Synchronization of larval emergence in winter moth (Operophtera brumata L.) and budburst in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) under simulated climate change (1996) Ecol Entomol, 21, pp. 335-343; Cammell, M.E., Knight, J.D., Effects of climatic change on the population dynamics of crop pests (1992) Adv Ecol Res, 22, pp. 117-162; Dougen, S.V., Backeljau, T., Matthysen, E., Dhondt, A.A., Synchronization of hatching date with budburst of individual host trees (Quercus robur) in the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) and its fitness consequences (1997) J Anim Ecol, 66, pp. 113-121; Furuno, T., Ecology of tea leaf roller (Caloptilia theivora Walsingham) and its control in warm region (1982) Bull Miyazaki Agric Exp Stat Jpn, 16, pp. 43-51; Gilbert, N., Raworth, D.A., Insects and temperature - A general theory (1996) Can Entomol, 128, pp. 1-13; Graf, B., Höpli, H.U., Höhn, H., The smaller fruit tortrix, Grapholita lobarzewskii: Predicting the phenology of adult emergence (1999) Entomol Exp Appl, 93, pp. 299-304; (2003) The Power of Tea (in Japanese), , Hakamada K (ed) Kagaku Nippousya, Tokyo, Japan; Higley, L.G., Pedigo, L.P., Ostlie, K.R., Degday: A program for calculating degree-days and assumptions behind the degree-days approach (1986) Environ Entomol, 15, pp. 999-1016; Ikemoto, T., Takai, K., A new linearized formula for the law of total effective temperature and the evaluation of line-fitting methods with both variables subject to error (2000) Environ Entomol, 29, pp. 671-682; Inoue, T., Ohgushi, R., A simulation model of the arrowhead scale population on a citrus trees in relation to control programmes (I) (1976) Res Popul Ecol, 18, pp. 89-104; (1994) History of Plant Protection of Kagoshima Prefecture, , Iwamura Insatsu, Kagoshima, Japan; (1993) Biotic Interactions and Global Change, , Kareiva PM, Kingsolver JG, Huey RB (eds) Sinauer Associates Inc.
