Trends of annual freezing and thawing index were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and a simple linear regression method. The results show that: 1) The mean annual freezing indices range from 95 to 2300°C•d and the mean annual thawing indices range from 630 to 3250°C•d. The mean annual freezing index of the 7 stations exhibited decreasing trends with decreasing rate of -16.6 - 59.1°C•d /10a. The mean annual thawing index of these 7 stations showed increasing trends with the related decreasing rate is 19.83-45.6°C•d /10a. 2) The MK trend test indicated the significant decreasing trends (significant at < 0.05 significant level) in the annual freezing index for most stations except for Golmud. The significant increasing trends can be observed in the annual thawing index for 4 stations except Golmud and Tuotuohe. Golmud was the only station with no trends in both annual freezing and annual thawing index. © 2008 Science in China Press.","Freezing and thawing index; Global warming; Qinghai-Xizang Railway; Trends",,,,,,,"Cheng, G., Jiang, H., Wang, K., Thawing index and freezing index on the embankment surface in permafrost regions (2003) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 25, pp. 603-607. , 6; Frauenfeld, O.W., Zhang, T., McCreight, J.L., Northern Hemisphere freezing/thawing index variations over the twentieth century (2007) International Journal of Climatology, 27, pp. 47-63; Gao, R., Wei, Z., Dong, W., Interannual variation of the beginning date and the ending date of soil freezing in the Tibetan Plateau (2003) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 25, pp. 49-54. , 1; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., (2001) Climate Change 2000. the Scientific Basis, p. 770. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge, UK; Jin, H., Li, S., Wang, S., Effects of climate change on permafrost and environment in cold region of China (2000) Acta Geographica Sinica, 55, pp. 161-173. , 2; King, L., Herza, T., Hartmanna, H., The PACE monitoring strategy: A concept for permafrost research in Qinghai-Tibet (2006) Quaternary International, 154-155, pp. 149-157; Li, L., Li, F., Guo, A., Study on the climate change trend and its catastrophe over ""sanjiangyuan"" region in recent 43 years (2006) Journal of Natural Resources, 21, pp. 79-85. , 1; Liu, X., Chen, B., Climatic warming in the Tibetan Plateau during recent decades (2000) International Journal of Climatology, 20, pp. 1729-1742; Niu, T., Liu, H., Song, Y., Study on decade change of climate shift from warm-dry period to warm-wet period over Tibetan Plateau (2005) Journal of Applied Meteorological Science, 16, pp. 763-771. , 6; Partal, T., Ercan, K., Trend analysis in Turkish precipitation data (2006) Hydrological Processes, 20, pp. 2011-2026; Serrano, A., Materos, V.L., Garcia, J.A., Trend analysis of monthly precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1921-1995 (1999) Phys.
