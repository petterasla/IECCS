Chemists Corp., 280 Simcoe Street, Toronto, Ont. M5T 2Y5, Canada; Mackay, D., Environmental Modelling Centre, Trent University, Peterborough, Ont. K9L 1N6, Canada","Current approaches to modelling the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment have evolved in response to four dominant characteristics of these substances; namely: (1) the presence of POPs in virtually all environmental phases and the ease with which they move from one to the other requires multi-compartmental modelling. Describing transport across phase boundaries becomes as, or even more, important as quantifying transport within the phases; (2) POPs may persist in the environment for many decades. For chemicals that 'have time', concepts such as equilibrium partitioning and steady-state become more important than for short-lived substances whose fate is more controlled by the rates of transformation; (3) measuring POPs is difficult and expensive and observed concentrations of POPs are not available in high spatial or temporal resolution. Consequently, high resolution tends not to be a high priority in POP models; and (4) detrimental effects of POPs often manifest themselves in top predators, which has led to a focus on modelling biotic uptake and transfer within food chains. The task of building a POPs model is viewed as combining the four 'building blocks' of partitioning, transport, transformation and source data with the help of the law of the conservation of mass. Process models, evaluative models, models of real local, regional and global fate, as well as biological uptake models are presented and references to numerous examples are provided. An attempt is made to forecast future directions in the field of POPs modelling. It is expected that modelling techniques that do not rely on quantitative emission estimates as well as approaches that take into account spatial, temporal and climatic variability as well as parameter uncertainty will increase in importance. Finally, the relationship between modelling POPs and models of other pollutant issues is addressed, as are potential interactions between POPs and pollutant issues such as eutrophication, acidification and global climate change.","Mass balance models; Persistent organic pollutants","mass balance; modeling; organic pollutant; acidification; bioaccumulation; compartment model; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; global climate; greenhouse effect; model; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant; prediction",,,,,,"Ambrose R.B., Jr., Wool, T.A., Connolly, J.P., Schanz, R.W., (1988) WASP4, A Hydrodynamic and Water Quality Model - Model Theory, User's Manual, and Programmer's Guide (EPA/600/3-97/039), , US EPA Environmental Research Laboratory, Athens, GA; Atkinson, R., Atmospheric lifetimes of dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (1991) The Science of the Total Environment, 104, pp. 17-33; Axelman, J., (1997) Biological, Physico-Chemical and Biogeochemical Dynamics of Hydrophobic Organic Compounds, , Ph.D. thesis, Stockholm University, Sweden; Baldry, D., Calamari, D., Yaméogo, L., (1995) Environmental Impact Assessment of Settlement and Development in the Upper Léraba Basin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, and Mali (World Bank Technical Paper No. 302), 302. , The World Bank, Washington DC; Barber, M.C., Suárez, L.A., Lassiter, R.R., Modeling bioconcentration of nonpolar organic pollutants by fish (1988) Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 7, pp. 545-558; Barber, M.C., Suárez, L.A., Lassiter, R.R., Modelling bioaccumulation of organic pollutants in fish with an application to PCBs in Lake Ontario salmonids (1991) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 48, pp. 318-337; Barron, M.G., Stehly, G.R., Haylon, W.L., Pharmacokinetic modeling in aquatic animals.
