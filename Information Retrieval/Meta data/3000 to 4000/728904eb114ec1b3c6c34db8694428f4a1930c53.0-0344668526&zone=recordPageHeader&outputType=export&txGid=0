IRD was found in all strata except those from the Holocene and oxygen isotope stage 5.5. The largest expansion of sea ice was recognized at the last glacial maximum (LGM; oxygen isotope stage 2), when the southern margin of seasonal sea ice was probably located in the vicinity of the Matsumae Plateau. The margin might occasionally have expanded further southward to off the Oga Peninsula. Sea ice expanded southward from mid-stage 5 to the LGM in response to global cooling, but with much fluctuation. Sea ice remained during deglaciation until around 10 ka, but after 10 ka it retreated northward rapidly in response to global warming and changes in surface water conditions. Greater fluctuations in IRD were found in core GH95-1208 collected from off Rumoi, Hokkaido, Japan. More IRD was found in sediments from late stage 3, late stage 5, and early stage 6. The fluctuations were not concordant with global climate changes (based on the standard oxygen isotope curve), and may have been controlled by regional climate factors such as the strength of the winter monsoon, which is related in turn to high-latitude atmospheric circulation.","Dropstones; IRD; Japan Sea; Late Quaternary; Sea ice; Winter monsoon","ice-rafted debris; Last Glacial Maximum; oxygen isotope; paleoceanography; Quaternary; sea ice; sediment core; Sea of Japan",,,,,,"An, Z.S., Porter, S.C., Millennial-scale climatic oscillations during the last interglaciation in central China (1997) Geology, 25, pp. 603-606; Bischop, J., (2000) Ice Drift, Ocean Circulation and Climate Change, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 215 pp; Cavalieri, D.J., Parkinson, C.L., On the relationship between atmospheric circulation and the fluctuations in the sea ice extents of the Bering and Okhotsk Seas (1987) J.
