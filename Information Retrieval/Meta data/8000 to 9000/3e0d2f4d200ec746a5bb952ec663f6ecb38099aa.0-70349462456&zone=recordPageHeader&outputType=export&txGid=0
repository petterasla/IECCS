Bias and uncertainty analyses of ensemble simulations from a global earth systems model show increased warming and more intense heat waves combined with greater uncertainty and large regional variability in the 21st century. Global warming trends are statistically validated across ensembles and investigated at regional scales. Observed heat wave intensities in the current decade are larger than worst-case projections. Model projections are relatively insensitive to initial conditions, while uncertainty bounds obtained by comparison with recent observations are wider than ensemble ranges. Increased trends in temperature and heat waves, concurrent with larger uncertainty and variability, suggest greater urgency and complexity of adaptation or mitigation decisions.","Climate change; Extremes; Regional analysis","adaptation; article; astronomy; climate change; comparative study; geography; global change; greenhouse effect; heat; priority journal; simulation; temperature; uncertainty",,,,,,"Raupach, M.R., Global and regional drivers of accelerating CO2 emissions (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 10288-10293; Marland, G., Uncertainties in accounting for CO2 from fossil fuels (2008) J Ind Ecol, 12, pp. 136-139; (2007) Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007, , IPCC Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; (2003) Climate Change: Observations and Predictions, , Hadley Centre Met Office, Exeter, UK; (2000) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, , Nakicenovic N, Swart R, Eds Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Meehl, G.A., Tebaldi, C., More intense, more frequent, and longer lasting heat waves in the 21st century (2004) Science, 305 (5686), pp. 994-997. , DOI 10.1126/science.1098704; Stainforth, D.A., Allen, M.R., Tredger, E.R., Smith, L.A., Confidence, uncertainty and decision-support relevance in climate predictions (2007) Philos Trans R Soc London Ser A, 365, pp. 2145-2161; Stainforth, D.A., Downing, T.E., Washington, R., Lopez, A., Issues in the interpretation of climate model ensembles to inform decisions (2007) Philos Trans R Soc London Ser A, 365, pp. 2163-2177; Dessai, S., O'Brien, K., Hulme, M., Editorial: On uncertainty and climate change (2007) Global Environ Change, 17, pp. 1-3; Lopez, A., Tebaldi, C., New, M., Stainforth, D., Allen, M., Kettleborough, J., Two approaches to quantifying uncertainty in global temperature changes (2006) Journal of Climate, 19 (19), pp. 4785-4796. , DOI 10.1175/JCLI3895.1; Barnett, D.N., Brown, S.J., Murphy, J.M., Sexton, D.M.H., Webb, M.J., Quantifying uncertainty in changes in extreme event frequency in response do doubled CO2 using a large ensemble of GCM simulations (2006) Clim Dyn, 26, pp. 489-511; Tebaldi, C., Smith, R.L., Nychka, D., Mearns, L.O., Quantifying uncertainty in projections of regional climate change: A Bayesian approach to the analysis of multimodel ensebles (2005) J Clim, 18, pp. 1524-1540; Stott, P.A., Forest, C.E., Ensemble climate predictions using climate models and observational constraints (2007) Philos Trans R Soc London Ser A, 365, pp. 2029-2052; Toth, Z., Kalnay, E., Ensemble forecasting at NCEP and the breeding method (1997) Monthly Weather Review, 125 (12), pp. 3297-3319; Stainforth, D.A., Aina, T., Christensen, C., Collins, M., Faull, N., Frame, D.J., Kettleborough, J.A., Allen, M.R., Uncertainty in predictions of the climate response to rising levels of greenhouse gases (2005) Nature, 433 (7024), pp. 403-406. , DOI 10.1038/nature03301; Stott, P.A., Kettleborough, J.A., Origins and estimates of uncertainty in predictions of twenty-first century temperature rise (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 723-726; Collins, M., Booth, B.B.B., Harris, G.R., Murphy, J.M., Sexton, D.M.H., Webb, M.J., Towards quantifying uncertainty in transient climate change (2006) Climate Dynamics, 27 (2-3), pp. 127-147. , DOI 10.1007/s00382-006-0121-0; Pielke, R.A., (2008) Overheated Claims, , Financial Post, June 17; Rahmstorf, S., Recent climate observations compared to projections (2007) Science, 316, p. 709; Berliner, V.M., Kim, Y., Bayesian design and analysis for superensemble-based climate forecasting (2008) Journal of Climate, 21 (9), pp. 1891-1910. , http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0442/21/9/pdf/i1520-0442-21-9- 1891.pdf, DOI 10.1175/2007JCLI1619.1; Watson, J., Certainty and uncertainty in climate change predictions: What use are climate models?
