It largely refers to an international experts workshop on the topic held in October 1994 in Beijing, which was the first meeting in a series of IAEA expert meetings on comparison of FENCH-GHG emission from energy sources. The findings and recommendations of the workship cover topics such as time horizon, plant life time, materials flows and system output comparability.
