To experimentally determine how tall, mature trees respond to warming, we developed a new technique that heated canopy-level branches with electric heating cables. Using a canopy crane, we attached electric cables to top canopy branches of tall, mature Quercus crispula Blume (18-20. m in height) trees; shoot temperature was elevated 5. °C above ambient. Branch warming extended the length of the growing season of canopy leaves by later leaf fall. Moreover, branch warming increased acorn production. Application of this technique should lead to a better understanding of how tall, mature trees respond to global warming. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy crane; Field experiments; Global warming; Leaf fall; Masting","canopy; dicotyledon; fieldwork; fruit; global warming; growing season; leaf; leaf litter; masting; numerical model; phenology; Quercus crispula",,,,,,"Basset, Y., Horlyck, V., Wright, J., Forest canopies and their importance (2003) Studying Forest Canopies from Above: The International Canopy Crane Network, pp. 27-34. , Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and UNEP, Panama, Y.
