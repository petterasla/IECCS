Three future years' annual average deposition rates (i.e., 2049-2051) are compared with historic ones (i.e., 2000-2002) accounting for existing US and individual State's emission regulations and strategies. Impacts of global climate change alone on regional nitrogen and sulfur deposition are small compared to impacts from emission control-related reductions for the projections used in this study. The combined effect of climate change and emission reductions is a decrease in the annual average nitrogen and sulffir deposition over the US. Reduced nitrogen species dominate oxidized nitrogen deposition in the future. Spatial distribution plots for both components show lower deposition rates in the future mainly in the middle and eastern States where reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions are more pronounced.
