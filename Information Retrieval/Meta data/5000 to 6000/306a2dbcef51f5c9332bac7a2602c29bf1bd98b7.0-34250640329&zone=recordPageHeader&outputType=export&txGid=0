Using otolith analysis, we reconstructed historical changes in annual growth rates for the juveniles of eight long-lived fish species in the southwest Pacific, from as early as 1861. Six of the eight species show significant changes in growth rates during the last century, with the pattern differing systematically with depth. Increasing temperatures near the ocean surface correlate with increasing growth rates by species found in depths <250 m, whereas growth rates of deep-water (>1,000 m) species have declined substantially during the last century, which correlates with evidence of long-term cooling at these depths. The observations suggest that global climate change has enhanced some elements of productivity of the shallow-water stocks but also has reduced the productivity, and possibly the resilience, of the already slow-growing deep-water species. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Fisheries; Marine ecology; Oceanography","article; climate change; ecology; fish; global climate; growth rate; marine environment; nonhuman; oceanography; Pacific Ocean; priority journal; water temperature; animal; classification; climate; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; sea; temperature; time; Animals; Climate; Ecosystem; Fishes; Oceans and Seas; Temperature; Time Factors",,,,,,"Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) Marine Fish and Fisheries, , Department for Environment, DEFRA, London; Devine, J.A., Baker, K.D., Haedrich, R.L., (2006) Nature, 439, p. 29; Hsieh, C.-H., Reiss, C.S., Hunter, J.R., Beddington, J.R., May, R.M., Sugihara, G., (2006) Nature, 443, pp. 859-862; Allison, P.L., Low, P.J., Ellis, J.R., Reynolds, J.D., (2005) Science, 308, pp. 1912-1915; (2005) ICES J Mar Sci, 7, pp. 1203-1542. , Drinkwater KF, Loeng H, Megrey BA, Bailey N, Cook RM, eds; Casselman, J.M., (1990) Trans Am Fish Soc, 119, pp. 673-688; Boehlert, G.W., Yoklavich, M.M., Chelton, D.B., (1989) Fish Bull, 87, pp. 791-806; Pereira, D.L., Anderson, C.S., Radomski, P.J., Sak, T., Stevens, A., (1995) Can Spec Publ Fish Aquat Sci, 121, pp. 709-717; Mace, P.M., Feanaughty, J.M., Coburn, R.P., Doonan, I.J., (1990) N Z J Mar Freshwater Res, 24, pp. 105-119; Stewart, B.D., Fenton, G.E., Smith, D.C., Short, S.A., (1995) Mar Biol, 123, pp. 29-38; Morison, A.K., Robertson, S.G., Smith, D.C., (1998) North Am J Fish Manage, 18, pp. 587-598; James, G.D., Inada, T., Nakamura, I., (1988) N Z J Zool, 15, pp. 291-326; Kailola, P.J., Williams, M.J., Stewart, P.C., Reichelt, R.E., McNee, A., Grieve, C., (1993) Australian Fisheries Resources, , Bureau of Resource Science, Canberra, ACT, Australia; Ricker, W.E., (1969) J Fish Res Board Can, 26, pp. 479-541; Hazell, J.R., (1993) The Physiology of Fishes, pp. 427-468. , ed Evans DH CRC, Boca Raton, FL, pp; Klaer, N., (2006), PhD Thesis Univ of Canberra, Canberra, AustraliaGillie, S.H., (2002) Science, 295, pp. 1275-1277; Harris, G.P., Nilsson, C., Clementson, L., Thomas, D., (1987) Aust J Mar Freshwater Res, 38, pp. 569-590; Thresher, R.E., (2002) Int J Clim, 22, pp. 901-915; Thresher, R.E., Rintoul, S.R., Koslow, J.A., Weidman, C., Adkins, J., Proctor, C., (2004) Geophys Res Lett, 31, pp. L07212; Cai, W., Shi, G., Cowen, T., Bi, D., Ribbe, J., (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, pp. L23706; Beamish, R., Mahnken, C., Neville, C.M., (2004) Trans Am Fish Soc, 133, pp. 26-33; Mittelbach, G.C., (1981) Ecology, 62, pp. 1370-1386; Fischer, T., (2003) Berichte Polar Meeresforch, 454, pp. 1-101; Garrod, D.J., (1988) Fish Population Dynamics, pp. 185-218. , ed Gulland JA Wiley, New York, 2nd Ed, pp; Conroy, A.M., Pankhurst, N.W., (1989) N Z J Mar Freshwater Res, 23, pp. 525-527; Christie, G.C., Regier, H.A., (1988) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 45, pp. 301-314; Clark, M., (2001) Fish Res, 51, pp. 123-135; Ratz, H.-C., Lloret, J., (2005) ICES J Mar Sci, 62, pp. 1310-1321; Levitus, S., Antonov, J.I., Boyer, T.P., Stephens, C., (2000) Science, 287, pp. 2225-2229; Fukasawa, M., Freeland, H., Perkin, R., Watanabe, T., Uchida, H., Nishina, A., (2004) Nature, 427, pp. 825-827; Anderson, O.F., Bagley, N.W., Hurst, R.J., Francis, M.P., Clark, M.R., McMillan, P.J., Atlas of New Zealand Fish and Squid Distributions from Research Bottom Trawls (Natl Inst of Water and Atmos Res, Auckland, New Zealand) (1998) Tech Rep, 42","Thresher, R.E.; Cmw.
