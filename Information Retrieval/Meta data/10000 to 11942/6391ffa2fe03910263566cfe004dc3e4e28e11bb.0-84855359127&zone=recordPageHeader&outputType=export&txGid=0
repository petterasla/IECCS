At the same time, it is increasingly clear that climate change impacts are already occurring and that further effects cannot be completely avoided. Thus, anticipating and planning for emerging and potential future climate change impacts in California must complement the state's greenhouse gas mitigation efforts. These impacts will depend substantially on the future evolution of the state's social structure and economy. To support impact studies, this report describes socioeconomic storylines and key scenario elements for California that are broadly consistent with the global ""A2"" and ""B1"" storylines in the 2000 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, including qualitative socioeconomic context as well as quantitative projections of key variables such as population, urbanization patterns, economic growth, and electricity prices. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"California; Climate change impact; Demographic trends; Economic growths; Electricity prices; Energy systems; Environmental policy; Future climate; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Impact study; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Key variables; Low carbon economy; Social structure; Special report on emissions scenarios; Storylines; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental protection; Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Risk perception; Climate change; climate change; demography; economic growth; emission control; emissions trading; energy efficiency; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; socioeconomic status; California; United States",,,,,,"Abrishami, M., Bender, S., Lewis, K.C., Movassagh, N., Puglia, P., Sharp, G., Sullivan, K., Vidivar, D., (2005) Energy Demand Forecast Methods Report: Companion Report to The California Energy Demand 2006-2016 Staff Energy Demand Forecast Report, , Staff Report CEC-400-2005-036; Arthur, D., (2002) Benefits of Reducing Demand For Gasoline and Diesel-vol. 3, Task 1 Report, , Little, Inc, Joint Report to the California Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission, March 28; Bauer, P.W., Lee, Y., (2006) Estimating GSP and Labor Productivity By State, , Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Policy Discussion Paper Number 16, March; (2007) California 1990 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Level and 2020 Emissions Limit, , California Air Resources Board16, Jamesine Rogers, Primary Author, November: Staff Report; (2008) Climate Change Draft Scoping Plan: A Framework For Change, , California Air Resources Board (2008), June, Discussion Draft; Clarke, K.C., Gaydos, L.J., Loose-coupling a cellular automaton model and GIS-long-term urban growth prediction for San Francisco and Washington/Baltimore (1998) Int J Geogr Inf Sci, 12 (7), pp. 699-714; Clarke, L., Edmonds, J., Jacoby, H., Pitcher, H., Reilly, J., Richels, R., (2007) Scenarios of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Atmospheric Concentrations, p. 154. , Sub-report 2. 1A of Synthesis and Assessment Product 2. 1 by the U.
