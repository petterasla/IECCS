Time series lengths on the order of 50-350 years are required to detect plausible P, E, and Q trends in the Missouri, Ohio, and Upper Mississippi River basins. Approximately 80-160, 50, and 140-350 years, respectively, are needed to detect the predicted P, E, and Q trends with a high degree of statistical confidence. These detection time estimates are based on conservative statistical criteria (α = 0.05 and β = 0.10) associated with low probability of both detecting a trend when it is not occurring (Type I error) and not detecting a trend when it is occurring (Type II error). The long detection times suggest that global-warming-induced changes in annual basin-wide hydro-climatic variables that may already be occurring in the three basins probably cannot yet be detected at this level of confidence. Furthermore, changes for some variables that may occur within the 21st century might not be detectable for many decades or until the following century - this may or may not be the case for individual recording station data. The long detection times for streamflow result from comparatively low signal-to-noise ratios in the annual time series. Finally, initial estimates suggest that faster detection of acceleration in the hydrological cycle may be possible using seasonal time series of appropriate hydro-climatic variables, rather than annual time series. © Springer 2005.",,"Budget control; Climate change; Evaporation; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Signal to noise ratio; Water; Hydroclimatic variables; Hydrological cycle; Parallel climate model (PCM); Variable infiltration capacity (VIC); Rivers; climate change; evapotranspiration; precipitation assessment; streamflow; Mississippi River; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",,,,,,"Abdulla, F.A., Lettenmaier, D.P., Wood, E.F., Smith, J.A., Application of a macroscale hydrologic model to estimate the water balance of the Arkansas-Red River Basin (1996) J.
