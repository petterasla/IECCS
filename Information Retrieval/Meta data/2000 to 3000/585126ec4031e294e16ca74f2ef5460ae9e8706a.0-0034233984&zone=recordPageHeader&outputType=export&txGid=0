This physically based model has the potential to project stream flow under the possible climate scenarios.A physically based, semi-distributed water balance model was developed for quantitative simulation of hydrological processes and stream flow and of global warming impacts on high altitude, mountainous stream flow. The model was applied to the Urumqi River Basin, Tianshan, China. Input parameters include meteorological and hydrological data on precipitation, air temperature, snowfall ratio, wind speed, soil moisture content, and evapotranspiration. Some were estimated by Landsat and a digital elevation model of the basin, while others were interpolated from point measurements. A sensitivity analysis of model performance is discussed. Simulated results are in reasonable agreement with field observations or other estimated results. The model could be used to project stream flow under different climate scenarios.","DEM; Evapotranspiration; Remote sensing; Semi-distributed hydrological model; Spatially distributed meteorological parameters; Surface soil moisture content","Digital elevation model (DEM); Thematic mapping; Water balance model; Computer simulation; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Moisture; Remote sensing; Runoff; Soils; Stream flow; Rivers; climate change; estimation method; evapotranspiration; global warming; river discharge; streamflow",,,,,,"Bai, C., A study on the interaction of the glaciers and climate (1989) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 11, pp. 287-296; Daly, C., Neilson, R.P., Phillips, D.L., A statistical-topographic model for mapping climatological precipitation over mountainous terrain (1994) Journal of Applied Meteorology, 33, pp. 140-158; Duchon, C.E., Salisbury, J.M., Lee Williams, T.H., Nicks, A.N., An example of using Landsat and GOES data in a water budget model (1992) Water Resources Research, 28 (2), pp. 527-538; Gleick, P.H., The development and testing of a water balance model for climate i mpact assessment: Modeling the Sacramento Basin (1987) Water Resources Research, 23, pp. 1049-1061; Kalma, J.K., Boulet, G., Measurement and prediction of soil moisture in a medium-sized catchment (1998) Hydrological Sciences Journal, 43 (4), pp. 597-610; Kang, E., Ohmura, A., A study of energy, water and mass balance on the glacierized watershed in Tianshan and a runoff model (1994) Chinese Science (B), 24 (9), pp. 983-991; Kang, E., Zhu, S., Huang, M., The hydrological features of the glaciers in Mountain Tomur, Tianshan (1985) Glaciers and Climate in Mountain Tomur, Tianshan, pp. 99-119. , The People's Publishing House of Xingjiang; Kojima, K., (1979) Snowmelt Mechanism and Heat Budget, 146, pp. 1-38. , Meteorological Study Notes; Lai, Z., A water balance model for the high altitude alpine regions and the possible runoff changes under the global warming tendency (1991) Chinese Academy of Science (B Volume), 6, pp. 654-658; Lettenmaier, D.P., Gan, T.Y., Hydrologic sensitivities of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin, California, to global warming (1990) Water Resources Research, 26, pp. 69-86; Link, L.E., Compatibility of present hydrologic models with remotely sensed data (1983) Proceedings of the 17th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of the Environment, pp. 245-253; Loumagne, C., Chkiret, N., Normand, M., Ottle, C., Vidal-Madjar, D., Introduction of the soil/vegetation/atmosphere continuum in a conceptual rainfall/runoff model (1996) Hydrological Sciences Journal, 41 (6), pp. 889-902; McCabe G.J., Jr., Mark, A.A., Hydrologic effects of climate change in Delaware River Basin (1987) Wate r Resources Bulletin, 25, pp. 1231-1242; Mimikon, M., Kouvpoulos, Y., Cavadias, G., Vayianos, N., Regional hydrological effect of climate change (1991) Journal of Hydrology, 123, pp. 119-146; Mohseni, O., Stefan, H.G., A monthly streamflow model (1998) Water Resources Research, 34, pp. 1287-1298; Morton, F.I., Operational estimates of areal evapotranspiration and their signi ficance to the science and practice of hydrology (1983) Journal of Hydrology, 66, pp. 1-76; Naef, F., Can we model the rainfall-runoff process today (1981) Hydrological Sciences Bulletin, 26 (3), pp. 521-532; Nash, L.L., Gleick, P.H., Sensitivity of streamflow in the Carolado Basin to climatic change (1991) Journal of Hydrology, 125, pp. 225-241; Nijssen, B., Lettenmai er, D.P., Xu, L., Wetzel, S.W., Wood, E.F., Streamflow simulation for continental-scale river basins (1997) Water Resources Research, 33 (4), pp. 711-724; Stefan, G.A., (1988) Permafrost and Climate, , Permafrost Institute of Siberian Branch.
