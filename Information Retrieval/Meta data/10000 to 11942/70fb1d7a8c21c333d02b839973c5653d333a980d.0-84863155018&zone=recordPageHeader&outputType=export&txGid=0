In this paper, the climate change in Jiaodong Peninsula, China was analyzed by the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, Accumulated Difference Curve and Order Cluster Analysis methods, based upon the temperature and precipitation data over the past 50 years. Results obtained showed a number of observations: (1) The annual mean temperature of Jiaodong Peninsula showed a significant increasing trend, with a distinct abrupt change point detected around 1990, during the past 5 decades. The warming of Jiaodong Peninsula over the last 50 years was due mainly to the significant increase of annual minimum temperature. (2)The annual precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend during the past 5 decades, with an abrupt change detected around 1980 at most stations; there was an earlier transition point at 1966, at a few stations. The reduction in precipitation, from June to September, was responsible mainly for the decrease of annual precipitation. (3)The temperature evolution in Jiaodong Peninsula was basically consistent with most parts of the world, but warmed at a faster rate over the same period; the decreasing trend of precipitation was more significant. Within the Peninsula, the southeastern part has earlier transition points of temperature and precipitation, as well as larger reduction of precipitation than the northwest. This research was of great importance to understand the climate change and its environmental effects in the coastal zone.","Abrupt change; Climate change; Coastal zone","climate change; cluster analysis; coastal development; coastal zone; global change; industrial development; population density; precipitation (climatology); research work; temperature effect; China; Shandong; Shandong Peninsula",,,,,,"(2006) Climate and Environment in China, , China Meteorological Administration.
