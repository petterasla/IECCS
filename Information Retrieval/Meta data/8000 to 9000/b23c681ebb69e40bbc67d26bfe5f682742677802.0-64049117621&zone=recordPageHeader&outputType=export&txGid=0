Extending the same analysis to the fully coupled simulations of these models as well as other Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) coupled models, it is found that these two biases persist. Relative to the earlier estimates from AMIP simulations, the overestimate of the positive feedback from water vapor is alleviated somewhat for most of the coupled simulations. Improvements in the simulation of the cloud albedo feedback are only found in the models whose AMIP runs suggest either a positive or nearly positive cloud albedo feedback. The strength of the negative cloud albedo feedback in all other models is found to be substantially weaker than that estimated from the corresponding AMIP simulations. Consequently, although additional models are found to have a cloud albedo feedback in their AMIP simulations that is as strong as in the observations, all coupled simulations analyzed in this study have a weaker negative feedback from the cloud albedo and therefore a weaker negative feedback from the net surface heating than that indicated in observations. The weakening in the cloud albedo feedback is apparently linked to a reduced response of deep convection over the equatorial Pacific, which is in turn linked to the excessive cold tongue in the mean climate of these models. The results highlight that the feedbacks of water vapor and clouds-the cloud albedo feedback in particular - may depend on the mean intensity of the hydrological cycle. Whether the intermodel variations in the feedback from cloud albedo (water vapor) in the ENSO variability are correlated with the intermodel variations of the feedback from cloud albedo (water vapor) in global warming has also been examined. While a weak positive correlation between the intermodel variations in the feedback of water vapor during ENSO and the intermodel variations in the water vapor feedback during global warming was found, there is no significant correlation found between the intermodel variations in the cloud albedo feedback during ENSO and the intermodel variations in the cloud albedo feedback during global warming. The results suggest that the two common biases revealed in the simulated ENSO variability may not necessarily be carried over to the simulated global warming. These biases, however, highlight the continuing difficulty that models have in simulating accurately the feedbacks of water vapor and clouds on a time scale of the observations available. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric model intercomparison projects; Climate models; Cloud albedos; Coupled models; Coupled simulations; Deep convections; Equatorial pacific; Feedbacks]; Fully-coupled; Hydrological cycles; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Mean intensities; Negative feedbacks; Positive correlations; Positive feedbacks; Surface heating; Time-scale; Tropical clouds; Tropical waters; Water vapor feedbacks; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Clouds; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Solar radiation; Water vapor; Feedback; albedo; climate feedback; climate forcing; climate modeling; cloud cover; computer simulation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; estimation method; feedback mechanism; global warming; greenhouse effect; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; observational method; tropical environment; water vapor; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial)",,,,,,"Barkstrom, B.
