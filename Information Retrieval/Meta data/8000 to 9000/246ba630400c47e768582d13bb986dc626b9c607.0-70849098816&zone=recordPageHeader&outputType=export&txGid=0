That theory, in turn, exemplifies one side of a broader debate about the relative influence on clade dynamics of intrinsic (biotic) vs. extrinsic (physical-environmental) forces. Here, we use a fossil-calibrated molecular chronogram to compare the effects of a major biotic factor (repeated shift to a chemically divergent host plant clade) and a major abiotic factor (global climate change) on the macroevolutionary dynamics of a large Cenozoic radiation of phytophagous insects, the leaf-mining fly genus Phytomyza (Diptera: Agromyzidae). We find one of the first statistically supported examples of consistently elevated net diversification accompanying shift to new plant clades. In contrast, we detect no significant direct effect on diversification of major global climate events in the early and late Oligocene. The broader paleoclimatic context strongly suggests, however, that climate change has at times had a strong indirect influence through its effect on the biotic environment. Repeated rapid Miocene radiation of these flies on temperate herbaceous asterids closely corresponds to the dramatic, climatedriven expansion of seasonal, open habitats.","Adaptive radiation; Agromyzidae; Climate change; Coevolution; Macroevolution","adaptive radiation; article; biodiversity; Cenozoic; cladistics; climate change; controlled study; environmental radioactivity; evolutionary developmental biology; fly; fossil; Miocene; molecular dynamics; natural host; nonhuman; Oligocene; priority journal; statistical analysis; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Climate; Diptera; Fossils; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Population Dynamics; Temperature; Agromyzidae; asterids; Diptera; Hexapoda; Phytomyza","GENBANK: EU367919, EU367920, EU367921, EU367922, EU367923, EU367924, EU367925, EU367926, EU367927, EU367928, EU367929, EU367930, EU367931",,,,,"Vrba, E.S., Environment and evolution: Alternative causes of the temporal distribution of evolutionary events (1985) S Afr J Sci, 81, pp. 229-236; Benton, M.J., The red queen and the court jester: Species diversity and the role of biotic and abiotic factors through time (2009) Science, 323, pp. 728-732; Simpson, G.G., (1953) The Major Features of Evolution, , Columbia Univ Press, New York; Jablonski, D., Biotic interactions and macroevolution: Extensions and mismatches across scales and levels (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 715-739; McKenna, D.D., Farrell, B.D., Tropical forests are both evolutionary cradles and museums of leaf beetle diversity (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 10947-10951; Ehrlich, P.R., Raven, P.H., Butterflies and plants: A study in coevolution (1964) Evolution, 18, pp. 586-608; Winkler, I.S., Mitter, C., (2008) Specialization, Speciation, and Radiation: the Evolutionary Biology of Herbivorous Insects, pp. 240-263. , ed Tilmon KJ (Univ California Press, Berkeley); Berenbaum, M.R., Feeny, P.P., (2008) Specialization, Speciation, and Radiation: the Evolutionary Biology of Herbivorous Insects, pp. 3-19. , ed Tilmon KJ (Univ California Press, Berkeley); Mayhew, P.J., Why are there so many insect species?
