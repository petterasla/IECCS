This perceived relationship has been used to extrapolate the effects of climatologically warmer SSTs on tropical cyclones. These warmer SSTs are one of the consequences of doubled CO2 predicted by climate general circulation models (GCMs). Very few investigations have actually critically addressed this SST-storm intensity relationship, however. In this paper, a limited area modeling study is used to explore the potential links between SST and tropical cyclone intensity. Previous work, including some observational data, is reviewed and its implications for the interpretation of the results given here is presented. -from Authors",,"cyclone; model; rainfall; rainfall intensity; sea surface temperature; sensitivity; SST; tropical cyclone; tropical cyclones",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08948755,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028259545
