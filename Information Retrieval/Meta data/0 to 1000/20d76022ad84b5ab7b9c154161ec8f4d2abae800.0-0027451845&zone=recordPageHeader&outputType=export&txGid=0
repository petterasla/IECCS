The present sharp rise in CO2, driven mainly by the comparatively rapid combustion of fossil carbon representing the energy deposits arising from slow accumulation from the ecosystems of bygone ages, is expected to have profound effects on the present and future global climate as well as on natural ecosystems, their associated biodiversity and current patterns of agricultural production. However, there exists an even more serious facet to the problem posed by the necessity to control increasing CO2 and associated global warming and that is the loss of biodiversity (ecosystems, habitats, and species), resulting from the fact that climatic change and biological diversity are intimately inter-linked. Plants are the only organisms capable of removing significant amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. It is now certain that natural responses for sequestering carbon have been outstripped, therefore humankind will be forced to accelerate the biosphere adjustment processes, i.e. massive reforestation programs and ecosystem engineering in order to buffer atmospheric CO2. A significant part of this atmospheric carbon was, until recently, sequestered into oil and coal by biological and geological action. Currently, mainly due to industrialization, man is pumping sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere at a rate faster than the present distribution of ecosystems, including agricultural crops, can absorb and is therefor largely responsible for the ""greenhouse effect"". Moreover, most prehistoric global ecological changes occurred slowly, probably over millions of years and vegetation had sufficient time to either move or adapt. Present changes are expected to include an increase in the average temperature (which will not necessarily be evenly distributed), a subsequent rise of sea level and the redistribution of precipitation. These changes will occur in less than the lifetime of an average tree. It is probable that many species will not have the necessary time to adjust and will perish as their habitats disappear and vegetation belts change. Over 50% of the original forest biomass covering the globe before the advent of modern civilization has already been removed and replaced by human habitats and associated agricultural systems. Even simple solutions to the problem of sequestering carbon through traditional mono-culture plantation developments are no longer tenable because of the excessive geographical areas that would be involved. © 1993.",,"carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; atmosphere; biomass; climate; combustion; conference paper; ecosystem; energy resource; environmental impact assessment; industrialization",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Adams, Faure, Fauvre-Denard, McGlade, Woodward, Increases in terrestrial carbon storage from the last glacial maximum to the present (1990) Nature, 328, pp. 711-714. , 20/27 Dec. 1990; Adriesse, (1974) Tropical lowland peats in southeast Asia, , Kononklijk Inst. voor de Tropen, Amsterdam, 1974 (cited in Whitten et.al., 1987); Allard, Carbonnelle, Dajlevic, Le Bronec, Morel, Robe, Maurenas, Zettwoog, Eruptive and diffusive emissions of CO2 from Mount Etna (1991) Nature, 5-351, pp. 387-391. , 30 May 1991; Anderson, The structure of the peat swamps of Sarawak and Brunei (1964) The Journal. of Tropical Geography, 18, pp. 7-16. , 1964; Appenzeller, Fire and ice under the deep-sea floor (1991) Science, 5-252, pp. 1790-1792. , 28 June 1991; Arthur, Allard, Hinga, Cretaceous and Cenozoic atmospheric carbon dioxide variations and past global climate change (1991) Geological Society of America.
