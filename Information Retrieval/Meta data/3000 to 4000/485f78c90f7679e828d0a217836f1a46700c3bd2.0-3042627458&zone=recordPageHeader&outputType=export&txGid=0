Most observations were made during 10-20 November, but 29 species were in flower after 10 December. The number of species flowering declined steadily with time, rather than declining precipitously after the first frost. Only 6 of these 92 species are specifically reported in the floras of Nova Scotia as flowering in November. Examination of plant collections in the primary Nova Scotia herbaria showed that our collections represent the latest flowering records for all but one of these species in Nova Scotia. Accordingly, our collection extends the known flowering times for these species by an average of 45 days. For most species the late flowering is interpreted as an extension of normal phenology in response to unusually warm autumn weather, but for some species (e.g., Viola cucullata, Ranunculus acris, Fragaria virginiana) it appears to represent a second flowering period. Our collections establish a base line of late flowering times that could be used as an indicator of regional climate change.","Climate change; Flowering; Global warming; Nova Scotia; Phenology","Acris; Fragaria; Fragaria virginiana; Fragaria x ananassa; Magnoliophyta; Ranunculaceae; Ranunculus; Ranunculus acris; Viola cucullata; Violaceae",,,,,,"Abu-Asab, M.S., Peterson, P.M., Shetler, S.G., Orli, S.S., Earlier plant flowering in spring as a response to global warming in the Washington, DC, area (2001) Biodivers.
