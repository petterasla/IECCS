Box 4120, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany","This paper considers the design, incentives and effectiveness of U.S. demand side management (DSM) programs and tries to explain why this ambitious, almost unanimously embraced initiative failed. Problems on the demand side result from consumers' private information that implies that substantial principal-agent slippage must accompany any conservation incentive the utility offers to the consumer. Moreover, the regulatory incentives induce the American utility to select inefficient programs. Therefore, the utility has little to gain from deterring such strategic reactions and cheating by consumers. As a consequence, the reported conservation exists largely on paper but not in reality. This ex-post assessment is important for two reasons. First, European countries (Scandinavia, Germany, Austria and others) have been eager to repeat this American regulatory `success'. Second, the problems addressed in this paper would apply to another round of conservation programs induced by the concern about global warming.",,"Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Global warming; Demand side management (DSM) programs; Energy management",,,,,,"Allen, V., A disability crutch (1996) USA TODAY, pp. 11A. , July 10th 1996; Averch, H., Johnson Leland, L., Behavior of the Firm under Regulatory Constraint (1962) American Economic Review, 52, pp. 1052-1069; Braithwait, S., Caves, D., Three Biases in Cost-Efficiency Tests of Utility Conservation Programs (1994) The Energy Journal, 15 (1), pp. 95-120; Wirl, F., Conservation Incentives for Consumers (1999) Journal of Regulatory Economics, 15, pp. 23-40; Wirl, F., Huber, C., Walker, I.O., Joint Implementation: Strategic Reactions and Possible Remedies (1998) Environmental and Resource Economics, 12, pp. 203-224; Wirl, F., Orasch, W., Analysis of United States' Utility Conservation Programs (1998) Review of Industrial Organization, 13, pp. 467-486","Wirl, Franz; Otto-von-Guericke Univ of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany",,,"IAEE, Cleveland, OH, United States",,,,,01956574,,ENJOD,,"English","Energy J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033887951
