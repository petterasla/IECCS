An internationally comparative study on material intensity and efficiency of fossil fuels was presented to illustrate their environmental impacts on Hubei province. The study shows that material efficiency of fossil fuels in Hubei was close to the average level in China, but far lower than that in the developed countries. Global warming potential (GWP) was the greatest one and occupied 41.4% of total environmental impact. Therefore, the key pathway to reduce environmental pollution was to improve the utilizing efficiency of fossil fuels, and to control the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. © by PSP 2007.","Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Hubei province; Life cycle assessment; Material flow analysis","comparative study; emission control; environmental impact assessment; fossil fuel; global warming; life cycle analysis; nitrogen dioxide; pollution; sulfur dioxide; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Hubei",,,,,,"Ayres, R.U., Kneese, A.V., Production, Consumption and Externalities (1969) American Economic Review, 59 (3), pp. 282-297; Fischer, K.M., Society's Metabolism, the Intellectual History of Material Flow Analysis (1860-1970) (1998) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 2 (1), pp. 61-78; (1992) Quality of the environment in Japan (Year 1992), pp. 27-29. , Japan Environment Agency , Japan Environment Agency, Tokyo; (2001) Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts and Derived Indicators: A Methodological Guide, pp. 15-44. , European Community , Office for Official Publications of the European Community, Luxembourg; Chen, X.Q., Qiao, L.J., The material flow analysis of the economic-environment system in China (2000) Natural Resources, 15 (1), pp. 17-23; Xu, M., Zhang, T.Z., Material flow analysis of fossil fuel usage in the Chinese economy (2004) Tsinghua university Journal of Natural Sciences, 44 (9), pp. 1166-1170; Liu, J.Z., Wang, Q., Gu, X.W., Direct material input and dematerialization analysis of Chinese economy (2005) Resources Science, 27 (1), pp. 46-51; (1991) 2004) Hubei statistical yearbook, pp. 35-70. , Hubei Provincial Bureau of Statistics, China Statistics Press, Beijing; Schuetz, H., Bringezu, S., (1998) Economy-wide material flow accounting, pp. 1-31. , Wuppertal Institute, Wuppertal; (1991) China energy statistical yearbook, pp. 165-418. , National Bureau of Statistics of China, China Statistics Press, Beijing; (1991) World economic yearbook, pp. 530-533. , Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, China Social Science Press, Beijing; Wang, M.P., The correct deduce of conversion relation about oil and natural gas (2003) Jianghan Oil College Journal, 16 (3), pp. 40-42; Pollution release applied handbook (1998) China Environmental Science Press, pp. 115-137. , SEPA, Beijing; Handbook for industrial pollutants production and discharge and emission coefficients (1996) China Environmental Science Press, pp. 191-197. , SEPA, Beijing; Hubei's environment.
