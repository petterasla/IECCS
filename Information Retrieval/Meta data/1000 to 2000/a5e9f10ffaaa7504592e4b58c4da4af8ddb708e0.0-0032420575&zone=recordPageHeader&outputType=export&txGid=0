Because photosynthesis rates in co-occurring tree species can differ in their sensitivity to environmental conditions, these changes in species composition are likely to alter the carbon dynamics of temperate forests. To help improve our understanding of such atmosphere-biosphere interactions, we explored changes in leaf-level photosynthesis in a 60-70 yr old temperate mixed-deciduous forest in Petersham, Massachusetts (USA). Diurnally and seasonally varying environmental conditions differentially influenced in situ leaf-level photosynthesis rates in the canopies of four mature temperate deciduous tree species: red oak (Quercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), white birch (Betula papyrifera), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). We measured in situ photosynthesis at two heights within the canopies (top of the canopy at ~20 m, and in the sub-canopy of the same individual trees at ~14-16 m) through a diurnal time course on 7 d over two growing seasons. We simultaneously measured a suite of environmental conditions surrounding the leaf at the time of each measurement. We used path analysis to examine the influence of environmental factors on in situ photosynthesis in the tree canopies. Overall, red oak had the highest photosynthesis rates, followed by white birch, yellow birch, and red maple. There was little evidence for a substantial midday depression in photosynthesis. Instead, photosynthesis declined throughout the day, particularly after 1600. Diurnal patterns of light reaching canopy leaves, leaf and air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) contributed to diurnally varying photosynthesis rates. Large differences in these parameters through the growing season partly led to the seasonal differences observed in photosynthesis rates. Path analyses helped to identify the relative contribution of various environmental factors on photosynthesis and further revealed that species-specific sensitivities to various environmental conditions shifted through the season. Red oak photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to air temperatures late in the season when air temperatures were low. Further, red maple photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to high VPDs through the growing season. Incorporating data on the physiological differences among tree species into forest carbon models will greatly improve our ability to predict alterations to the forest carbon budgets under various environmental scenarios such as global climate change, or with differing species composition.","Acer rubrum, Betula alleghaniensis, Betula papyrifera; Canopy-tree photosynthesis; Harvard Forest (Petersham, Massachusetts, USA); Leaf-level photosynthesis, path analysis, photosynthesis, seasonal and diurnal variation, Quercus rubra, temperate deciduous forests","canopy; deciduous tree; environmental conditions; photosynthesis; United States",,,,,,"Amthor, J.S., Respiration in a future, higher-CO2 world (1991) Plant Cell and Environment, 14, pp. 13-20; Bassow, S.L., (1995) Canopy Photosynthesis in A Deciduous Forest: Implications of Shifts in Species Composition and Rising Concentrations of CO2, , Dissertation.
