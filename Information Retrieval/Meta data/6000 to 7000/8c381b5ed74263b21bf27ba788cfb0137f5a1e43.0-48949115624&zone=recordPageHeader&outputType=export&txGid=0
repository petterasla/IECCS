Nevertheless, background information allowing evaluation of impacts is rather scarce for some geographic zones. Our study of an alpine community on the Plateau of Muses (2600-2750 m a.s.l.) of Mt Olympos, the highest mountain of Greece, conducted in 1993-1994, can provide such background information for the Mediterranean region. We studied features relating to phenology of flowering, floral morphology, distribution and abundance, and flower visitors of plant species that exhibit a biotic pollination syndrome. We identified dominant patterns and we further (i) explored the relative contribution of the plant features and abiotic factors studied in explaining the activity patterns of flower visitors, (ii) examined if flower and visitor traits of the alpine community match each other according to the classical pollination syndromes, and (iii) investigated whether the responses of individual plant species to the yearly climatic variability result into phenological patterns that characterize the whole community. The common strategy of the alpine community was for early flowering and long flower life span; consistently early flowering species were twice as many as late flowering ones, whereas floral longevity (estimated for 36 species) averaged 5.2 days. Duration of flowering (estimated for 57 species) averaged 18.2 days. Climatic variability affected onset of flowering; all late flowering species delayed their flowering during the year characterized by a humid and cold summer. Duration of flowering and floral longevity did not change in a consistent way. Hymenoptera (Aculeates) were the dominant flower visitors. They accounted for 43.3% of the visits recorded, with bumblebees making a little less than half. Diptera followed making 37.5% of the visits (most made by syrphid flies). There was a mismatch between flower-morphology and flower visitor traits; the alpine community had predominantly non-specialized, pale-colour flowers, which are traits assumed to correspond to Diptera dominance and absence of social bees. Visitation was influenced by flower abundance and duration of flowering; proportionately more Diptera, and proportionately less Hymenoptera visited species with short flowering periods and few flowers present in the field. In a number of cases, the phenological and flower visitor patterns of the community of Mt Olympos deviated from those observed in other alpine environments suggesting a mediterranean influence even at high altitudes. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.
