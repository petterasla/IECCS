Can economic growth be sustained without increasing energy demand? Is the prospect of global warming and the destabilisation of the weather machine so daunting that a global carbon tax should be instituted? Can renewable energy replace fossil fuel in the next 50 years? Will nuclear energy re-emerge as the high technology solution to our problems?"".","Carbon emissions; Energy policy; Nuclear fossil fuel; Renewable; Security of supply","Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Renewable energy resources; Economy; Energy demand; Sustainable development; alternative energy; carbon emission; global warming; policy strategy; renewable resource",,,,,,,"Fells, I.; Department of Chemical/Process Eng., University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,09576509,,PPENE,,"English","Proc.
