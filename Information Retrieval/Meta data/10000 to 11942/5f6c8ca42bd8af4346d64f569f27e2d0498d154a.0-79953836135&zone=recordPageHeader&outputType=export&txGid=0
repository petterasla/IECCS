Chassis dynamometer emission testing was conducted on 30 in-use auto-rickshaws to quantify the impact of switching from gasoline to compressed natural gas (CNG) in spark-ignition engines. Thirteen test vehicles had two-stroke CNG engines (CNG-2S) and 17 had four-stroke CNG engines (CNG-4S), of which 11 were dual-fuel and operable on a back-up gasoline (petrol) system (PET-4S). Fuel-based emission factors were determined for gaseous pollutants (CO 2, CH4, NOX, THC, and CO) and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5). Intervehicle variability was high, and for most pollutants there was no significant difference (95% confidence level) between ""old"" (1998-2001) and ""new"" (2007-2009) age-groups within a given fuel-technology class. Mean fuel-based PM 2.5 emission factor (mean (95% confidence interval)) for CNG-2S (14.2 g kg -1 (6.2-26.7)) was almost 30 times higher than for CNG-4S (0.5 g kg -1 (0.3-0.9)) and 12 times higher than for PET-4S (1.2 g kg -1 (0.8 -1.7)). Global warming commitment associated with emissions from CNG-2S was more than twice that from CNG-4S or PET-4S, due mostly to CH4 emissions. Comprehensive measurements and data should drive policy interventions rather than assumptions about the impacts of clean fuels. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Chassis dynamometers; Clean fuel; CNG engine; Comprehensive measurement; Confidence interval; Confidence levels; Dual-fuels; Emission factors; Emission testing; Engine technology; Fine particulate matter; Gaseous pollutants; Policy intervention; Spark ignition engines; Test vehicle; Air quality; Compressed natural gas; Dynamometers; Energy resources; Fog; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Global warming; Pollution; Dual fuel engines; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; compressed natural gas; gasoline; hydrocarbon; methane; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; unclassified drug; air quality; carbon emission; climate change; engine; fossil fuel; health impact; natural gas; particulate matter; policy implementation; traffic emission; transport vehicle; article; combustion; controlled study; exhaust gas; gas analysis; greenhouse effect; India; motor vehicle; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Gasoline; Global Warming; Humans; India; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions; India",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; gasoline, 86290-81-5; methane, 74-82-8; natural gas, 8006-14-2; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; Air Pollutants; Fossil Fuels; Gasoline; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",,,,"(2010) Outdoor Air Pollution andHealth in the Developing Countries of Asia: A Comprehensive Review, , http://pubs.healtheffects.org/view.php?id=349, HEI.
