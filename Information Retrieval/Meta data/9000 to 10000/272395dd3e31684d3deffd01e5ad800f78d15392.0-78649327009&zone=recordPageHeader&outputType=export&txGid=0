The development of effective conservation measures depends on understanding the causes of such phase shifts. The prevailing view that coral-macroalgal phase shifts commonly occur due to insufficient grazing by fishes is based on correlation with overfishing and inferences from models and small-scale experiments rather than on long-term quantitative field studies of fish communities at affected and resilient sites. Consequently, the specific characteristics of herbivorous fish communities that most promote reef resilience under natural conditions are not known, though this information is critical for identifying vulnerable ecosystems. In this study, 11 years of field surveys recorded the development of the most persistent coral-macroalgal phase shift (>7 years) yet observed on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). This shift followed extensive coral mortality caused by thermal stress (coral bleaching) and damaging storms. Comparisons with two similar reefs that suffered similar disturbances but recovered relatively rapidly demonstrated that the phase shift occurred despite high abundances of one herbivore functional group (scraping/excavating parrotfishes: Labridae). However, the shift was strongly associated with low fish herbivore diversity and low abundances of algal browsers (predominantly Siganidae) and grazers/detritivores (Acanthuridae), suggesting that one or more of these factors underpin reef resilience and so deserve particular protection. Herbivorous fishes are not harvested on the GBR, and the phase shift was not enhanced by unusually high nutrient levels. This shows that unexploited populations of herbivorous fishes cannot ensure reef resilience even under benign conditions and suggests that reefs could lose resilience under relatively low fishing pressure. Predictions of more severe and widespread coral mortality due to global climate change emphasize the need for more effective identification and protection of ecosystem components that are critical for the prevention of coral reef phase shifts. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Coral reef; Diversity; Herbivorous fishes; Macroalgae; Phase shift; Resilience","abundance; barrier reef; climate change; coral; coral bleaching; disturbance; dominance; ecosystem resilience; fish; functional role; grazing; herbivore; macroalga; mortality; overfishing; species diversity; vulnerability; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; Acanthuridae; algae; Anthozoa; Labridae; Pisces; Scaridae; Siganidae",,,,,,"Bellwood, D.R., Choat, J.H., A functional analysis of grazing in parrotfishes (family Scaridae): the ecological implications (1990) Environ Biol Fish, 28, pp. 189-214; Bellwood, D.R., Fulton, C.J., Sediment-mediated suppression of herbivory on coral reefs: Decreasing resilience to rising sea levels and climate change?
