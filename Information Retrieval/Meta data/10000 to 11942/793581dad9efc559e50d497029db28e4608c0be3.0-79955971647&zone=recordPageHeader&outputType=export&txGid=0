Exposure to elevated ambient temperatures has been bmentioned as a risk factor for common eye diseases, primarily presbyopia and cataract. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship among ambient, cornea, and body core temperature. METHODS. The relation between corneal temperature and ambient temperature was examined in 11 human volunteers. Furthermore, corneal temperature was measured using a thermal camera during elevation of body core temperature in three human volunteers and four rats. RESULTS. A linear relationship between corneal temperature and body temperature was found in the rat. For humans there was an initial linear increase in corneal temperature with increasing body temperature, but corneal temperature seemed to plateau at 36.5°C to 37.0°C despite a continued increase of body core temperature. A linear relationship between ambient and corneal temperature was found in humans but with a less steep slope than that between corneal and body core temperature. CONCLUSIONS. Corneal temperature is estimated to reach the maximum of 36.5°C to 37.0°C at ambient temperatures between 32.0°C and 34.5°C. If there is a causal relationship between elevated eye temperature, cataract, and presbyopia, the incidence of these eye diseases is predicted to increase with global warming. Importantly, the strong association between corneal temperature and body core temperature indicates that frequent infections could also be considered a risk factor for age-related lens disorders. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.",,"adult; article; body temperature measurement; body temperature monitoring; camera; core temperature; cornea; cornea temperature; correlational study; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; human; human experiment; human versus animal comparison; nonhuman; normal human; priority journal; rat; temperature; temperature sensitivity; thermal infrared camera; Adult; Animals; Body Temperature; Body Temperature Regulation; Cornea; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Infrared Rays; Male; Middle Aged; Photography; Rats; Rats, Zucker; Thermography",,,,,,"Kiss, A.J., Mirarefi, A.Y., Ramakrishnan, S., Zukoski, C.F., Devries, A.L., Cheng, C.H.C., Cold-stable eye lens crystallins of the Antarctic nototheniid toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni Norman (2004) J Exp Biol, 207, pp. 4633-4649; Regini, J.W., Grossmann, J.G., Timmins, P., X-ray- and neutronscattering studies of alpha-crystallin and evidence that the target protein sits in the fenestrations of the alpha-crystallin shell (2007) Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 48, pp. 2695-2700; Regini, J.W., Grossmann, J.G., Burgio, M.R., Structural changes in alpha-crystallin and whole eye lens during heating, observed by low-angle X-ray diffraction (2004) J Mol Biol, 336, pp. 1185-1194; Heys, K.R., Friedrich, M.G., Truscott, R.J., Presbyopia and heat: Changes associated with aging of the human lens suggest a functional role for the small heat shock protein, alpha-crystallin, in maintaining lens flexibility (2007) Aging Cell, 6, pp. 807-815; Truscott, R.J., Presbyopia: Emerging from a blur towards an understanding of the molecular basis for this most common eye condition (2009) Exp Eye Res, 88, pp. 241-247; Miranda, M.N., Environmental temperature and senile cataract (1980) Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc, 78, pp. 255-264; Kojima, M., Okuno, T., Miyakoshi, M., Sasaki, K., Takahashi, N., Environmental temperature and cataract progression in experimental rat cataract models (2002) Dev Ophthalmol, 35, pp. 125-134; Bloemendal, H., de Jong, W., Jaenicke, R., Lubsen, N.H., Slingsby, C., Tardieu, A., Ageing and vision: Structure, stability and function of lens crystallins (2004) Progr Biophys Mol Biol, 86, pp. 407-485; Glasser, A., Croft, M.A., Kaufman, P.L., Aging of the human crystalline lens and presbyopia (2001) Int Ophthalmol Clin, 41, pp. 1-15; Glasser, A., Campbell, M.C.W., Biometric, optical and physical changes in the isolated human crystalline lens with age in relation to presbyopia (1999) Vis Res, 39, pp. 1991-2015; Brian, G., Taylor, H., Cataract blindness-challenges for the 21st century (2001) Bull World Health Organ, 79, pp. 249-256; Scott, J.A., A finite-element model of heat transport in the human eye (1988) Phys Med Biol, 33, pp. 227-241; Nybo, L., Secher, N.H., Nielsen, B., Inadequate heat release from the human brain during prolonged exercise with hyperthermia (2002) J Physiol, 545, pp. 697-704; Roth, J.V., Braitman, L.E., Nasal temperature can be used as a reliable surrogate measure of core temperature (2008) J Clin Monit Comput, 22, pp. 309-314; Hughes, A., A schematic eye for the rat (1979) Vision Res, 19, pp. 569-588; Fukuda, S., Kawana, K., Yasuno, Y., Oshika, T., Anterior ocular biometry using 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography (2009) Ophthalmology, 116, pp. 882-889; Canning, C.R., Greaney, M.J., Dewynne, J.N., Fitt, A.D., Fluid flow in the anterior chamber of a human eye (2002) IMA J Math Appl Med Biol, 19, pp. 31-60; Schwartz, B., Feller, M.R., Temperature gradients in the rabbit eye (1962) Invest Ophthalmol, 1, pp. 513-521; Rosenbluth, R.F., Fatt, I., Temperature measurements in the eye (1977) Exp Eye Res, 25, pp. 325-341; Geiser, M.H., Bonvin, M., Quibel, O., Corneal and retinal temperatures under various ambient conditions: A model and experimental approach (2004) Klin Monatsbl Augenheilkd, 221, pp. 311-314; Mapstone, R., Determinants of corneal temperature (1968) Br J Ophthalmol, 52, pp. 729-741","Kessel, L.; Department of Ophthalmology, Glostrup Hospital, Nordre Ringvej 57, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark; email: line.kessel@dadlnet.dk",,,,,,,,01460404,,IOVSD,20671277,"English","Invest.
