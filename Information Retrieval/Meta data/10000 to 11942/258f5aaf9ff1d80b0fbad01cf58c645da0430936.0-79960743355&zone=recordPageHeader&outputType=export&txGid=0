Heat or energy recovery is one of the main energy-efficient systems that has been approved to overcome this problem. However, in conventional heat or energy recovery for building applications, only sensible energy has been recovered and neglecting the latent energy. In this work, enthalpy recovery system has been developed and the performances of sensible and latent energy have been investigated experimentally. The efficiency of close to 66% has been achieved for sensible energy and the latent energy efficiency was nearly 59% gained. Comparison of efficiency with effectiveness-NTU method showed both were in good agreement. Recovered energy was achieved up to 167 W at 3.0 m/s air velocity with 4.3 °C temperature difference. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
