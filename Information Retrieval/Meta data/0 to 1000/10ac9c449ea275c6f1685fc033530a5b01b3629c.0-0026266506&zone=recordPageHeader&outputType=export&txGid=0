Proxy data for climate reconstruction can be derived from many sources, including the palaeolimnological record3,4. In closed-basin lakes in arid and semi-arid regions, shifts in effective moisture lead to the concentration or dilution of dissolved salts, and these changes in salinity are clearly reflected in the composition of lacustrine diatom assemblages5-8. Here we refine a previously published9 diatom-based transfer function for the reconstruction of past changes in salinity of lakes in the northern Great Plains region of North America, and apply the refined transfer function to a late-glacial and Holocene sediment record from Devils Lake, North Dakota. Our results show that there were a number of alternations between fresh and saline conditions during the Holocene and hence demonstrate the utility of the technique in reconstructing past changes in regional climate.",,"climate; climatic change; diatom; Holocene; palaeoenvironmental reconstruction; salinity; transfer function; USA, North Dakota, Devils Lake; Bacillariophyta",,,,,,,"Fritz, S.C.; Limnological Research Center, University of Minnesota, 310 Pillsbury Drive S.E., Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States",,,,,,,,00280836,,NATUA,,"English","Nature",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026266506
