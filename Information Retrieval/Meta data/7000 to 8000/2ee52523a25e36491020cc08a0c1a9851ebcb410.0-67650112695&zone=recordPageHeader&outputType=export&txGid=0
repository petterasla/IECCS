Here we show that winter recovery distances have decreased over the past seven decades, for birds ringed during the breeding season in the Netherlands between 1932 and 2004. Of the 24 species included in the analysis, we found in 12 a significant decrease of the distance to the wintering site. Species from dry, open areas shortened their distance the most, species from wet, open areas the least, while woodland species fall in between the other two habitats. The decline in migration distance is likely due to climate change, as migration distances are negatively correlated with the Dutch temperatures in the winter of recovery. With a shorter migration distance, species should be better able to predict the onset of spring at their breeding sites and this could explain the stronger advancement of arrival date found in several short distance species relative to long-distance migrants. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bird migration; Bird ringing; Climate change","bird; breeding season; breeding site; climate change; climate effect; global warming; migration; overwintering; ringing; travel behavior; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe; Aves",,,,,,"Alerstam, T., (1990) Bird Migration, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Batchelet, E., (1981) Circular Statistics in Biology, , Academic Press, London; Bearhop, S., Fiedler, W., Furness, R.W., Assortative mating as a mechanism for rapid evolution of a migratory divide (2005) Science, 310, pp. 502-504; Berthold, P., Patterns of avian migration in light of current global ""greenhouse"" effects: A central European perspective (1991) Acta XX Congressus Internationalis Ornithologici, pp. 780-786; Berthold, P., Fiedler, W., Schlenker, R., Querner, U., 25-year study of the population development of central European songbirds: A general decline most evident in long-distance migrants (1998) Naturwissenschaften, 85, pp. 350-353; Both, C., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.E., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Both, C., Visser, M.E., Adjustment to climate change is constrained by arrival date in a long-distance migrant bird (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 296-298; Butler, C.J., The disproportionate effect of global warming on the arrival dates of short-distance migratory birds in North America (2003) Ibis, 145, pp. 484-495; Coppack, T., Both, C., Predicting life-cycle adaptation of migratory birds to global climate change (2002) Ardea, 90, pp. 369-378; Coppack, T., Pulido, F., Czisch, M., Auer, D.P., Berthold, P., Photoperiodic responses may facilitate adaptation to climatic change in long-distance migratory birds (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences, 270 (SUPPL.), pp. S43-S46; Cotton, P.A., Avian migration phenology and global climate change (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100, pp. 12219-12222; (1977) Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.
