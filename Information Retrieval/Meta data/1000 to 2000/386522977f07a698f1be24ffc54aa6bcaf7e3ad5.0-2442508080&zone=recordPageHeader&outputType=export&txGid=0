Extractable carbon was determined by the fumigation-extraction method giving initial biomass values ranges from 160-600 μg C.g-1 soil for tropical soils and from 400-1300 μg C.g-1 soil for temperate soils. It was evident from all soils (except a tropical one) that biomass at 35°C decreased more, over a long incubation period, than at 15°C; the temperate soils had the highest decrease at 35°C. Death rate of biomass quotient (qD) calculated over the 150 days period of incubation showed that tropical and temperate soils, at 15°C. have similar values, but at 35°C temperate soils had higher rates than tropical soils, confirming the existence of some sensitivity of temperate soils to elevated temperature. Carbon from carbon dioxide (CO2-C) was also measured for all soils investigated. There was a greater respiration rate at 35°C than at 15°C for all the soils. The temperate soils showed faster mineralization rate than the tropical, mainly at 35°C. At this temperature the amounts of CO2-C respired were from 2 to 9 times as much carbon as was present in the original biomass, indicating that this carbon could only have come from the soil organic matter. Biomass specific respiration rate (mg CO2-C evolved.g-1 biomass.day-1) showed greater values for temperate soils at both temperatures; at 15°C the rate was 2.7 times greater and at 35°C the rate was 2.4 times greater. These results suggest that there is more available energy in the temperate soils than in the tropical soils, reinforcing that there is more carbon stored in microbial biomass of temperate soils. Comments are made on a possible contribution of microorganisms, mainly of temperate soils, to global warming, in case of a global atmospheric temperature elevation. However, it is important to consider other factors inherent to soil characteristics (i.e. organic matter added to soil, its plant cover, soil erosion, deforestation and climatic changes) as possibly stronger causes of global warming.","Fumigation-extraction; Global warming; Soil microbial activity; Soil microbial biomass; Temperate soil microorganisms; Tropical soil microorganisms",,,,,,,"Anderson, T.H., Domsch, K.H., Application of eco-physiological quotients (qCO2 and qD) on microbial biomasses from soils of different cropping histories (1990) Soil Biol Biochem, 22, pp. 251-255; Brown, L.R., What does global change mean for society?
