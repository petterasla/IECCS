An inventory-based procedure is presented to estimate forest management costs based on recognition of the opportunity costs of holding forest inventories. To demonstrate this procedure the costs of four policy scenarios projected in the carbon budget of the US are examined. The inventory-based procedure is shown to meet the requirements for estimating forest management costs to conserve and sequester atmospheric carbon on a regional scale. The demonstration also illustrates the potential of the procedure to provide insights into differences in costs associated with management of forest ecosystems among geographic regions and forest policies. -from Authors",,"carbon sequestration; climatic change; economic evaluation; environmental economics; forest management; USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667381
