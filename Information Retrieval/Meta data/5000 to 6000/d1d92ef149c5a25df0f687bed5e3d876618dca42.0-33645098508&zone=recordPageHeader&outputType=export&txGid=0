Here we coupled analysis of interannual variability in remotely sensed data with analyses of bird and butterfly community changes in montane meadow communities of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Landsat satellite imagery was used to classify these meadows into six types along a hydrological gradient. The northern portion of the ecosystem, or Gallatin region, has smaller mean patch sizes separated by ridges of mountains, whereas the southern portion of the ecosystem, or Teton region, has much larger patches within the Jackson Hole valley. Both support a similar suite of butterfly and bird species. The Gallatin region showed more overall among-year variation in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) when meadow types were pooled within regions, perhaps because the patch sizes are smaller on average. Bird and butterfly communities showed significant relationships relative to meadow type and NDVI. We identified several key species that are tightly associated with specific meadow types along the hydrological gradient. Comparing taxonomic groups, fewer birds showed specific habitat affinities than butterflies, perhaps because birds are responding to differences in habitat structure among meadow types and using the landscape at a coarser scale than the butterflies. Comparing regions, the Teton region showed higher predictability of community assemblages as compared to the Gallatin region. The Gallatin region exhibited more significant temporal trends with respect to butterflies. Butterfly communities in wet meadows showed a distinctive shift along the hydrological gradient during a drought period (1997-2000). These results imply that the larger Teton meadows will show more predictable (i.e., static) species-habitat associations over the long term, but that the smaller Gallatin meadows may be an area that will exhibit the effects of global climate change faster. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Butterflies; Climate change; Community structure; Discriminant analysis; Environmental variation; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Ordination; Songbirds; Species composition","biological marker; butterfly; community response; community structure; environmental change; NDVI; quantitative analysis; songbird; animal; article; bird; butterfly; classification; climate; comparative study; demography; disaster; environment; environmental monitoring; forecasting; geography; physiology; population dynamics; season; species difference; time; Animals; Biological Markers; Birds; Butterflies; Climate; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Geography; Natural Disasters; Population Dynamics; Residence Characteristics; Seasons; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Aves; Papilionoidea; Passeri",,"Biological Markers",,,,"Achard, F., Blasco, F., Analysis of vegetation seasonal evolution and mapping of forest cover in West Africa with the use of NOAA AVHRR HRPT data (1990) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 56, pp. 1359-1365; Becker, F., Choudhury, B.J., Relative sensitivity of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI) for vegetation and desertification monitoring (1988) Remote Sensing of Environment, 24, pp. 297-311; Brown, J.H., Valone, T.H., Curtin, C.G., Reorganization of an arid ecosystem in response to recent climate change (1997) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 94, pp. 9729-9733. , USA; Cairns Jr., J., The myth of the most sensitive species (1986) BioScience, 36, pp. 670-672; Cardillo, M., Macdonald, D.W., Rushton, S.P., Predicting mammal species richness and distributions: Testing the effectiveness of satellite-derived land cover data (1999) Landscape Ecology, 14, pp. 423-435; De'ath, G., Principal curves: A new technique for indirect and direct gradient analysis (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 2237-2253; Debinski, D.M., Jakubauskas, M.E., Kindscher, K., A remote sensing and GIS-based model of habitats and biodiversity in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (1999) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 20, pp. 3281-3292; Debinski, D.M., Jakubauskas, M.E., Kindscher, K., Montane meadows as indicators of environmental change (2000) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 64, pp. 213-225; Debinski, D.M., Jakubauskas, M.E., Kindscher, K., Saveraid, E.H., Borgognone, M., Predicting meadow communities and species occurrences in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (2002) Predicting Species Occurrences: Issues of Scale and Accuracy, pp. 499-506. , J.
