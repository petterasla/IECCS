The LCI data included CO 2 emissions from on-farm and off-farm fossil fuel consumption, soil CO 2 emissions induced by the decomposition of soil organic matter, direct and indirect N 2O emissions from arable lands and CH 4 uptake by soils, which were then aggregated in CO 2-equivalents. Under plow-based conventional tillage (CT) cropping systems for winter wheat, sugar beet, adzuki bean, potato and cabbage, on-farm CO 2 emissions from fuel-consuming operations such as tractor-based field operations, truck transportation and mechanical grain drying ranged from 0.424 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for adzuki bean to 0.826 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for winter wheat. Off-farm CO 2 emissions resulting from the use of agricultural materials such as chemical fertilizers, biocides (pesticides and herbicides) and agricultural machines were estimated by input-output tables to range from 0.800 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for winter wheat to 1.724 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for sugar beet. Direct N 2O emissions previously measured in an Andosol field of this region showed a positive correlation with N fertilizer application rates. These emissions, expressed in CO 2-equivalents, ranged from 0.041 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for potato to 0.382 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for cabbage. Indirect N 2O emissions resulting from N leaching and surface runoff were estimated to range from 0.069 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for adzuki bean to 0.381 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for cabbage. The rates of CH 4 removal from the atmosphere by soil uptake were equivalent to only 0.020-0.042 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1. From the difference in the total soil C pools (0-20 cm depth) between 1981 and 2001, annual CO 2 emissions from the CT and reduced tillage (RT) soils were estimated to be 4.91 and 3.81 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1, respectively. In total, CO 2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions under CT cropping systems in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido amounted to 6.97, 7.62, 6.44, 6.64 and 7.49 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 for winter wheat, sugar beet, adzuki bean, potato and cabbage production, respectively. Overall, soil-derived CO 2 emissions accounted for a large proportion (64-76%) of the total greenhouse gas emissions. This illustrates that soil management practices that enhance C sequestration in soil may be an effective means to mitigate large greenhouse gas emissions from arable land cropping systems such as those in the Tokachi region of northern Japan. Under RT cropping systems, plowing after harvesting was omitted, and total greenhouse gas emissions from winter wheat, sugar beet and adzuki bean could be reduced by 18%, 4% and 18%, respectively, mainly as a result of a lower soil organic matter decomposition rate in the RT soil and a saving on the fuels used for plowing. © 2006 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Fuel consumption; Greenhouse gas emission; Life cycle inventory; Reduced tillage; Soil carbon sequestration","Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Vigna angularis",,,,,,"Akiyama, H., Tsuruta, H., Effect of chemical fertilizer form on N 2O, NO and NO 2 fluxes from Andisol field (2002) Nutr.
