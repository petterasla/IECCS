Although the main factors controlling the production of N2O in soil are well known, we need more quantitative data on the interactions of soil and the environment in the soil that affect the emission. We therefore studied the effects of irrigation, cropping (fallow, barley with grass undersown) and N fertilization (unfertilized, 103 kg N ha-1) on the composition of soil air and direct N2O emission from soil (using the closed chamber method) in a factorial field experiment on a well-structured loamy clay soil during 1 June-22 October 1993. The measurements were made weekly during the growing season and three times after harvesting. The composition of the soil air did not indicate severe anoxia in any treatment or combination of treatments, but the accumulation of N2O in the soil air indicated that hypoxia was common. At the start of the irrigation the emissions were small, even though there was much ammonium and nitrate in the soil and therefore a potential for emission of N2O produced by both nitrification and denitrification. Larger emissions occurred later. The largest emissions were found when 60-90% of the soil pore space was filled with water. Irrigation and fertilization with N both roughly doubled the cumulative N2O emission. Growing a crop decreased it by a factor of 3-7. Most N2O was lost from the irrigated fertilized soil under fallow (3.5 kg N ha-1), and least from the unirrigated unfertilized soil under barley (0.1 kg N ha-1).",,"ammonia; environmental release; hypoxia; nitrogen metabolism; nitrous oxide; plant growth; soil air composition; agricultural practice; clay soil; emission; nitrous oxide; soil air; soil analysis",,,,,,"Arnold, P.W., Losses of nitrous oxide from soil (1954) Journal of Soil Science, 5, pp. 116-128; Aulakh, M.S., Rennie, D.A., Paul, E.A., Gaseous nitrogen losses from soils under zero-till as compared with conventional-till management systems (1984) Journal of Environmental Quality, 13, pp. 130-136; Bakken, L.R., Denitrification under different cultivated plants: Effects of soil moisture tension, nitrate concentration, and photosynthetic activity (1988) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 6, pp. 271-278; Bremner, J.M., Sources of nitrous oxide in soils (1997) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 49, pp. 7-16; Bremner, J.M., Blackmer, A.M., Effects of acetylene and soil water content on emission of nitrous oxide from soils (1979) Nature, London, 280, pp. 380-381; Bouwman, A.F., Direct emission of nitrous oxide from agricultural soils (1996) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 46, pp. 53-70; Cho, C.M., Burton, D.L., Chang, C., Kinetic formulation of oxygen consumption and denitrification processes in soil (1997) Canadian Journal of Soil Science, 77, pp. 253-260; Christensen, S., Simkins, S., Tiedje, J.M., Spatial variation in denitrification: Dependency of activity centers on the soil environment (1990) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 54, pp. 1608-1613; Christensen, S., Simkins, S., Tiedje, J.M., Temporal patterns of soil denitrification: Their stability and causes (1990) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 54, pp. 1614-1618; Currie, J.A., Gaseous diffusion in the aeration of aggregated soils (1961) Soil Science, 92, pp. 40-45; Davidson, E.A., Fluxes of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from terrestrial ecosystems (1991), pp. 219-235. , Microbial Production and Consumption of Greenhouse Gases: Methane, Nitrogen Oxides and Halomethanes (eds J.E.
