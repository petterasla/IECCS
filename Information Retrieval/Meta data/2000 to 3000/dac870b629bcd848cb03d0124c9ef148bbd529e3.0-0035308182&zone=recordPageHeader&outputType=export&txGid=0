According to Chinese industrial development intensity and population density, China was divided into three regions and the normalization references for each region were calculated on the basis of an inventory of all of the region's environmental emissions in 1990. The normalization reference was determined as the total environmental impact potential for the area in question in 1990(EP(j)90) divided by the population. The weighting factor was determined as the normalization reference (ER(j)90) divided by society's target contribution in the year 2000 based on Chinese political reduction plans, ER(j)T2000. This paper presents and discuss results obtained for eight different environmental impact categories relevant for China: global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, acidification, nutrient enrichment, photochemical ozone formation and generation of bulk waste, hazardous waste and slag and ashes.","China; Impact assessment factors; Life cycle","Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Ozone; Sustainable development; Population density; Environmental engineering; nitrogen derivative; ozone; phosphorus derivative; sulfur derivative; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; article; chemistry; China; environment; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; hazardous waste; human; incineration; industry; methodology; pH; photochemistry; risk assessment; standard; waste disposal; China; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Hazardous Waste; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Incineration; Industry; Nitrogen Compounds; Ozone; Phosphorus Compounds; Photochemistry; Reference Standards; Refuse Disposal; Risk Assessment; Sulfur Compounds; China",,"Hazardous Waste; Nitrogen Compounds; Ozone, 10028-15-6; Phosphorus Compounds; Sulfur Compounds",,,,"Akimoto, H., Narita, N., (1994) Atmospheric Environment [J], 28, pp. 213-225; (1996) Environmental Protection Plan during 1995-2000 and the Goals Beyond 2010 [M], , China SEPA, Beijing: China Environmental Science Press; (1995) China Environmental Yearbook [M], , Editorial Committe of China Environmental Yearbook, Beijing: China Environmental Sciences Press; Hauschild, M., Wenzel, H., (1998) Environmental Assessment of Products, Scientific Background [M], 2. , United Kingdom: Chapman & Hall; Jensen, A.A., Hoffmann, L., Moller, B., Life cycle assessment-a guide to approaches, experiences and information sources [R] (1998) Copenhagen, Denmark: European Environment Agency; Nielsen, P.H., Yang, J.X., (1999) Chinese Normalization References and Weighting Factors - According to the EDIP Impact Assessment Method [R], pp. 19-99. , Department of Manufacturing Engineering, Technical University of Denmark.
