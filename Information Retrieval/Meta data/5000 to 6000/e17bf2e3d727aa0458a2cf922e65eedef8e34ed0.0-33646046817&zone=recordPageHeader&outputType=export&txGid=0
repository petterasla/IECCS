High temperature electrolysis offers an advantage of higher energy efficiency over the conventional low-temperature alkaline electrolysis due to reduced cell potential and consequent electrical energy requirements. The primary energy source for the electrolysis will be advanced nuclear reactors operating at temperatures corresponding to those required for the high temperature electrolysis. The LCA examines the environmental impact of the combined advanced nuclear-high temperature electrolysis plant, focusing upon quantifying the emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides per kilogram of hydrogen produced. The results are presented in terms of the global warming potential (GWP) and the acidification potential (AP) of the system. The GWP for the system is 2000 g carbon dioxide equivalent and the AP, 0.15 g equivalents of hydrogen ion equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen produced. The GWP and AP of this process are one-sixth and one-third, respectively, of those for the hydrogen production by steam reforming of natural gas, and are comparable to producing hydrogen from wind- or hydro-electricity powered conventional electrolysis. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","High temperature electrolysis; Hydrogen; Life cycle assessment; Nuclear power","Carbon dioxide; Electrolysis; High temperature effects; Life cycle; Nuclear energy; Nuclear reactors; Vapors; Acidification potential (AP); Global warming potential (GWP); High temperature electrolysis; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Hydrogen",,,,,,"Veziroglu, T.N., Barbir, F., Hydrogen: the wonder fuel (1992) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 17, pp. 391-404; Shinnar, R., The hydrogen economy, fuel cells, and electric cars (2003) Technol Soc, 25, pp. 455-476; Winter, U., Weidner, H., Hydrogen for the mobility of future results of GM/Opel's well-to-wheel studies in North America and Europe (2003) Fuel Cells, 3 (3), pp. 76-83; Koroneos, C., Dompros, A., Roumbas, G., Moussiopoulos, N., Life cycle assessment of hydrogen fuel production process (2004) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 29, pp. 1443-1450; Bockris, JOM., Hydrogen economy in the future (1999) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 24, pp. 1-15; Momirlan, M., Veziroglu, T.N., Current status of hydrogen energy (2002) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 6, pp. 141-179; Rothstein, J., Hydrogen and fossil fuels (1995) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 20, pp. 283-286; Bockris, JOM., (1980) Energy options, , Halsted Press, New York; Kreuter, W., Hofmann, H., Electrolysis: the important energy transformer in a world of sustainable energy (1998) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 23, pp. 661-666; Shinnar, R., Shapira, D., Zakal, S., Thermochemical and hybrid cycles for hydrogen production.
