In the European context, the choice of a so-called ""cap and trade"" regime to curb emissions from industry is motivated by the search for a least-cost solution, in order to alleviate competitiveness concerns. The implementation mode of the EU Directive on CO2 emissions trading nevertheless creates uncertainties and concerns about potential distortions of competition that could arise once the system comes into play.",,"Least cost solution; National allocation; Potential distortions; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Competition; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions",,,,,,,"Bizec, R.-F.; Federation Francaise de l'Acier, Paris, France",,,,,,,,03404803,,SEZBA,,"English","Stahl Eisen",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0442279604
