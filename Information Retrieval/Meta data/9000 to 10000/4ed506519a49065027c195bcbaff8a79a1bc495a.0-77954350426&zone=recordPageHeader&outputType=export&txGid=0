This study uses daily rainfall data to determine if there are changes in the long-term trends in rainfall variability in the East Coast Mountains of Mauritius during the last few decades, and to investigate the factors influencing the trends in the inter-annual to inter-decadal rainfall variability. Statistical modelling has been used to investigate the trends in total seasonal rainfall, the number of rain days and the mean amount of rain per rainy days and the local, regional and large-scale factors that affect them on inter-annual to inter-decadal time scales. The strongest inter-decadal trend was found in the number of rain days for both rainfall seasons, and the other variables were found to have weak or insignificant trends. Both local factors, such as the surrounding sea surface temperatures and large-scale phenomena such as Indian Monsoon and the El Nino Southern Oscillation were found to influence rainfall patterns. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.","GAMs; Mauritius; Rainfall trends","Daily rainfall; East coast; El Nino southern oscillation; Global climate changes; If there are; Indian monsoon; Interannual; Interdecadal; Long-term trend; Precipitation trends; Rain days; Rainfall patterns; Rainfall trends; Rainfall variability; Rainy days; Scale Factor; Sea surface temperatures; Seasonal rainfall; Statistical modelling; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Landforms; Rain; annual variation; climate change; decadal variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; long-term change; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; sea surface temperature; trend analysis; Mascarene Islands; Mauritius",,,,,,"Allan, R.J., Chambers, D., Drosdowsky, W., Hendon, H., Latif, M., Nicholls, N., Smith, I., Tourre, Y., Is there an Indian Ocean dipole and is it independent of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation?
