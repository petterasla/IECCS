In this study, a drying treatment was developed for halon 1301 decomposition. Burnt lime, burnt dolomite, and burnt brucite were used as reactants. Halon 1301 is decomposed to gases containing halogen, and these gases react with the reactants simultaneously. The effects of the treatment temperatures, the treatment times, and the reactant compositions on the effective treatment process were investigated. Bromine in halon was almost completely recovered with the reactants. However, the recovery of fluorine was low. Burnt dolomite and burnt brucite were better reactants than burnt lime. The presence of MgO in the reactants plays an important role in this process. © Taylor and Francis Inc.","Adsorption; Decomposition; Diffusion; Dolomite; Halon; Magnesium oxide","Concentration (process); Decomposition; Fluorine; Global warming; Heat treatment; Ozone; Dolomites; Reactants; Treatment temperatures; Magnesium compounds; diffusion",,,,,,"Hidaka, Y., (1993) Int.
