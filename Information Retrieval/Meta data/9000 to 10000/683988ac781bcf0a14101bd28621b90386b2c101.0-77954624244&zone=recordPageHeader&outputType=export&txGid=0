Box 1033, Oslo 0315, Norway","Nearly 20. years of industrial scale metal mining operations in Tibet have caused an impact on the region's surface water quality. However, no information with respect to the pollution has been provided to the public. The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical quality of the stream water and to assess the present and future potential risks of acid mine drainage to the regional and downstream environments.This study, based on data collected in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in the Gyama valley, using the Environmental Risk Index (IER) documents that elevated concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Fe and Al in the surface water and streambed at the upper/middle part of the valley pose a considerably high risk to the local environment. In contrast, the risk level at the stream source area is zero and only minor risk at the lower reaches. The iron and copper contamination of the upper/middle part of the river appears to be both natural and accelerated by the mining activities. The level of dissolved contaminants in the water decreases within short distance downstream due to precipitation and sorption to the streambed and strong dilution by a tributary stream and eventually by the Lhasa River.A high content of heavy metals in the stream sediments as well as in a number of tailings with gangue and material from the ore processing, poses a great potential threat to the downstream water users. Environmental changes such as global warming or increased mining activity may increase the mobility of these pools of heavy metals. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Acid mine drainage; Environmental Risk Index (IER); Gyama valley; Heavy metal pollution; Mining in Tibet; Surface water quality","Acid mine drainage; Chemical quality; Copper contamination; Elevated concentrations; Environmental change; Environmental risk indices; Gyama valley; Heavy metal pollution; High-content; Industrial scale; Local environments; Metal mining; Mining activities; Potential risks; Potential threats; Risk levels; Short distances; Source area; Stream sediments; Stream water; Streambeds; Water users; Acids; Dissolution; Drainage; Environmental impact; Global warming; Heavy water; Hydraulics; Landforms; Lead; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Manganese removal (water treatment); Metals; Mining; Rivers; Sorption; Surfaces; Water content; Water pollution control; Water quality; Zinc; River pollution; aluminum; copper; fresh water; iron; lead; manganese; surface water; zinc; acid mine drainage; concentration (composition); environmental impact; environmental risk; global warming; heavy metal; mining; risk assessment; streamwater; water pollution; water quality; article; China; dilution; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; mining; priority journal; risk assessment; sediment; stream (river); waste water management; water contamination; water quality; water sampling; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Risk Assessment; Seasons; Tibet; Water Pollutants, Chemical; China; Lhasa River; Xizang",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; lead, 13966-28-4, 7439-92-1; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; zinc, 14378-32-6, 7440-66-6; Metals, Heavy; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"(1992) Chinese National Standards GB 5084-92: Standards for irrigation water quality, , (In Chinese), CSBTS and SEPA (China State Bureau of Technical Supervision and State Environmental Protection Administration of the P.R.China), CSBTS and SEPA (China State Bureau of Technical Supervision and State Environmental Protection Administration of the P.R.China); Registration list of impropriated mineral resources reserve of Tibet Autonomous Region until the end of 2007, , http://www.xzgtt.gov.cn/information/info/querying/gettingInfoRecord.asp?infoIdx=3859, (In Chinese).
