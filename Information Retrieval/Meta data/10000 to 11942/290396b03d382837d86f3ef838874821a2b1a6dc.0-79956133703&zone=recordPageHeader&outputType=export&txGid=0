In outdoor mesocosms, experiments tested how consumption of representatives of 4 different bivalve guilds by each of 3 mesopredators varies between continuous and fine-scale patches of oyster reef habitat. The mesopredator that fed least (stone crab) exhibited no detectable change in consumption on any bivalve (ribbed mussel, bay scallop, hard clam, and 3 size classes of eastern oyster). Consumption of bay scallops by both blue crabs and sheepshead fish was greater in small patches than in continuous oyster reef habitat. Of the bivalve guilds tested, only the scallop possesses swimming motility sufficient to reduce predation, an escape response that would likely leave the bivalve protected within structured habitat in larger continuous oyster reefs. Sheepshead consumed more small oysters in the continuous habitat than in the fine patches, while no other predator-prey interaction exhibited differential feeding as a function of habitat patchiness. Consequently, predation by mesopredators on bivalves can vary with the scale of oyster reef patchiness, but this process may depend upon the bivalve guild. Understanding the role of habitat patchiness on fine scales may be increasingly important in view of the declines in apex predatory sharks leading to mesopredator release, and global climate change directly and indirectly enhancing stone crab abundances, thereby increasing potential predation on bivalves. © Inter-Research 2011.","Bivalve guild; Habitat fragmentation; Oyster reefs; Predator-prey interactions; Scallop","bivalve; crab; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; motility; patchiness; perciform; population decline; predator-prey interaction; reef; swimming; Atlantic Ocean; United States; Archosargus probatocephalus; Argopecten irradians; Bivalvia; Callinectes sapidus; Chondrichthyes; Crassostrea virginica; Decapoda (Crustacea); Geukensia demissa; Ostreidae",,,,,,"Beck, M.W., Brumbaugh, R.D., Airoldi, L., Carranza, A., Oyster reefs at risk and recommendations for conservation, restoration, and management (2011) Bioscience, 61, pp. 107-116; Bologna, P.A.X., Heck Jr., K.L., Differential predation and growth rates of bay scallops within a seagrass habitat (1999) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 239 (2), pp. 299-314. , DOI 10.1016/S0022-0981(99)00039-8, PII S0022098199000398; Clark, M.E., Wolcott, T.G., Wolcott, D.L., Hines, A.H., Foraging behavior of an estuarine predator, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus in a patchy environment (2000) Ecography, 23 (1), pp. 21-31; Clarke, K.R., Non-parametric multivariate analyses of changes in community structure (1993) Australian Journal of Ecology, 18 (1), pp. 117-143; Coen, L., Luckenbach, M.W., Breitberg, D.L., The role of oyster reefs as essential fish habitat: A review of current knowledge and some new perspectives (1999) Fish Habitat: Essential Fish Habitat and Rehabilitation, pp. 438-454. , Benaka LR ed, American Fisheries Society, Bethesda, MD; Cronin, J.T., Habitat edges, within-patch dispersion of hosts, and parasitoid oviposition behavior (2009) Ecology, 90, pp. 196-207; Dayton, P.K., Competition, disturbance, and community organization-provision and subsequent utilization of space in a rocky intertidal community (1971) Ecol.
