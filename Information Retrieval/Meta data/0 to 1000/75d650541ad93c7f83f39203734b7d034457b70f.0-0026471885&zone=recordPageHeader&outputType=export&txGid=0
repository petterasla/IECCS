Model calculations indicate that if CO2 emissions are to be stabilized by means of a carbon tax, very high tax levels are required. The concept of cost-effectiveness in designing agglobal climate convention is discussed. Due to the huge differences in pre-tax energy prices, it is argued that a uniform CO2 tax is not necessarily cost-effective. The differences in price levels also have important implications for the effects of a CO2 tax on the markets for the various fuels. © 1992.","Carbon taxes; Energy markets; Global warming","air pollution; carbon dioxide; climate convention; cost-effectiveness; emission stabilisation; empirical analysis; energy market; global economy; policy impact; pollution problem; taxation impact",,,,,,"Manne, Richels, (1990) Global CO2 Emission Reductions — the Impacts of Rising Energy Costs, , For a discussion on this issue see, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA; Nordhaus, The Economics of the Greenhouse Effect (1989) paper presented at The International Energy Workshop 1989, , Vienna; Montgomery, Effects on Energy Markets and the US Economy of Measures to Reduce CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuels (1990) paper presented at Energy and the Environment in the 21st Century, , MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA; Grubb, (1990) The Greenhouse Effect: Negotiating Targets, , Royal Institute of International Affairs, London, UK; Hoel, Cost effective international Agreements of reducing the emissions of CO2 (1990) Sosialøkonomen, 4. , (in Norwegian); Grubb, op cit, Ref 2;Nitze, (1990) The Greenhouse Effect: Formulating a Convention, , Royal Institute of International Affairs, London, UK; Grubb, op cit, Ref 2;ECON, ECON-ENERGY: A Model for Analyzing Global Energy Markets and CO2 Emissions (1990) ECON-report No 11/90, , A detailed description of the model structure ECON-ENERGY is given, (in Norwegian), Oslo; ECON, The Effects of Climate Policy on the Markets for Oil and Gas (1990) ECON-report No 10/90, , A detailed description of the assumptions underlying the reference scenario is given in, (in Norwegian), Oslo; Grubb, op cit, Ref 2Nordhaus, op cit, Ref 1;Bye, Bye, Lorentsen, SIMEN.
