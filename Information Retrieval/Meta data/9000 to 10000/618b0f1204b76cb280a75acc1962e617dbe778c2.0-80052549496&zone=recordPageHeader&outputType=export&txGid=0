The total environment burden is evaluated from the electric consumption of machine tool components, coolant quantity, lubricant oil quantity, cutting tool status, and metal chip quantity. The initial step of this study is focused on machine tool operations. Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 100 years impact is taken as a key factor and equivalent CO 2 emission is evaluated. The relation between cutting conditions and environmental burden of machine tool operations is analyzed in this study. The results reveal the appropriate cutting conditions and can be used to predict and reduce the amount of CO 2 generated from machine tool operations. © 2010 ICIC International.","Environmental burden; Lca; Machine tool operations; Virtual manufacturing","Cutting conditions; Electric consumption; Environmental burdens; Global warming potential; Key factors; Lca; Life-cycle assessments; Lubricant oil; Machine tool components; Machine tool operation; Machine tool operations; Manufacturing process; Metal chips; On-machines; Virtual manufacturing; Virtual manufacturing process; Agile manufacturing systems; Carbon dioxide; Equipment; Global warming; Industrial engineering; Life cycle; Machine components; Metal cutting; Rating; Machine tools",,,,,,"Narita, H., Desmira, N., Fujimoto, H., Environmental burden analysis for machining operation using LCA method (2008) The 41st Conference on Manufacturing System, pp. 65-68. , Tokyo, Japan; Desmira, N., Narita, H., Fujimoto, H., The effect of high-speed milling to reduce environmental burden (2008) Proc. of the 7th International Conference on Machine Automation, pp. 351-356. , Awaji; Jain, S., Choong, N.F., Aye, K.M., Luo, M., Virtual factory: An integrated approach to manu- facturing systems modeling (2001) International Journal of Operation & Production Management, 21 (5), pp. 594-608; Narita, H., Shirase, K., Wakamatsu, H., Tsumaya, A., Arai, E., Real time cutting simulation sys- tem of a milling operation for autonomous and intelligent machine tools (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40 (15), pp. 3791-3805; (2002) Environmental Report of Tokyo Waterworks, , Bureau of Waterworks, Tokyo Metropolitan Government, in Japanese; Forster, P., Ramaswamy, V., Changes in atmospheric constituents and in radiative forcing (2007) IPCC 4th Assessment Report: Climate Change; (2002) (policy Eval- Uation), Section 6 Construction of Industrial Facilities (regional Economic Industry U), Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, , About declaration of evaluation report related to budget request in fiscal year, Development of Wastewater Treatment Technique, Japan, 2004; (2000) Eco-indicator 99 Manual for Designers, , Ministry of Housing Spatial Planning and the Environment; Mizukami, H., Yamaguchi, R., Nakayama, T., Maki, T., Off-gas treatment technology of ECOARC (2002) NKK Technical Report, (176), pp. 1-5. , in Japanese; Nansai, K., Moriguchi, Y., Tahono, S., (2002) Embodied Energy and Emission Intensity Data for Japan Using Input-output Tables (3EID) - Inventory Data For LCA, , Center for Global Environment Research, National Institute of Environmental Studies, Japan; First Section Meeting of ""Development of Energy Saving Wastewater Treatment Technique"" (2003) Program Original Register of Development of Energy Saving Wastewater Treatment Technique, , New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Development of Environment-Conscious Technology Laboratory; Consoli, F., Allen, D., Boustead, I., Fava, J., Franklin, W., Jensen, A.A., de Oute, N., Vigon, B., (1993) Guidelines for Life Cycle Assessment: A Code of Practice, Report of a Workshop Organized by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC), , Sesimbra, Portugal; (1995) Survey Report (additional Volume) of Basic Survey Research for Construction of Environmental Burden Evaluation System - Material Inventory Data, , The Society of Non-Traditional Technology, in Japanese; Earth, T., people and energy TECPO sustainability report, Tokyo Electronic Power Company Homepage (2003) Tokyo; Masahiro, A., The cutting characteristic of mold steel under the high-speed milling condition (2006) Nachi Technical Report Machining, 11 (A1-D1), pp. 1-7","Desmira, N.; Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology Gokiso-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466-8555, Japan; email: nelfa@vier.mech.nitech.ac.jp",,,,,,,,13494198,,,,"English","Int.
