Here we analyse the shift of temperature zones in eco-geographical study over China using projected future climate scenario. Projected climate data with high resolution during 1961-2080 were simulated using regional climate model of PRECIS. The number of days with mean daily temperature above 10°C and the mean temperature of January are usually regarded as the principal criteria to indicate temperature zones, which are sensitive to climate change. Shifts due to future climate change were calculated by comparing the latitude of grid cells for the future borderline of one temperature zone with that for baseline period (1961-1990). Results indicated that the ranges of Tropical, Subtropical, Warm Temperate and Plateau Temperate Zones would be enlarged and the ranges of Cold Temperate, Temperate and Plateau Sub-cold Zones would be reduced. Cold Temperate Zone would probably disappear at late this century. North borderlines of temperature zones would shift northward under projected future climate change, especially in East China. Farthest shifts of the north boundaries of Plateau Temperate, Subtropical and Warm Temperate Zones would be 3.1°, 5.3° and 6.6° latitude respectively. Moreover, northward shift would be more notably in northern China as future temperature increased. © 2010 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change; Eco-geographical study; Shift; Temperature zone",,,,,,,"Bailey, R., (1998) Ecoregions: The Ecosystem Geography of the Oceans and Continents, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Bailey, R., (2002) Ecoregion-Based Design for Sustainability, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Boisvenue, C., Running, S.W., Impacts of climate change on natural forest productivity: Evidence since the middle of the 20th century (2006) Global Change Biology, 12 (5), pp. 862-882; Callaghan, T.V., Björn, L.O., Chernov, Y., Effects of changes in climate on landscape and regional processes, and feedbacks to the climate system (2004) Ambio, 33 (7), pp. 459-468; Emanuel, W.R., Shugart, H.H., Stevenson, M.P., Climatic change and the broad-scale distribution of terrestrial ecosystem complexes (1985) Climatic Change, 7 (1), pp. 29-43; Grabherr, G., Gottfried, M., Pauli, H., Climate effects on mountain plants (1994) Nature, 369, p. 448; Summary for Policymakers (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
