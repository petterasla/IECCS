The formulation of the CFRAM is based on the energy balance in an atmosphere - surface column. In the CFRAM, the isolation of partial temperature changes due to an external forcing or an individual feedback is achieved by solving the linearized infrared radiation transfer model subject to individual energy flux perturbations (external or due to feedbacks). The partial temperature changes are addable and their sum is equal to the (total) temperature change (in the linear sense). The decomposition of feedbacks is based on the thermodynamic and dynamical processes that directly affect individual energy flux terms. Therefore, not only those feedbacks that directly affect the TOA radiative fluxes, such as water vapor, clouds, and ice-albedo feedbacks, but also those feedbacks that do not directly affect the TOA radiation, such as evaporation, convections, and convergence of horizontal sensible and latent heat fluxes, are explicitly included in the CFRAM. In the CFRAM, the feedback gain matrices measure the strength of individual feedbacks. The feedback gain matrices can be estimated from the energy flux perturbations inferred from individual parameterization packages and dynamical modules. The inter-model spread of a feedback gain matrix would help us to detect the origins of the uncertainty of future climate projections in climate model simulations. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Climate feedback; Climate sensitivity; Global warming","atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric general circulation model; climate feedback; climate modeling; energy balance; energy flux; estimation method; feedback mechanism; latent heat flux; oceanic general circulation model; parameterization; perturbation; radiative transfer; temperature gradient; top of atmosphere",,,,,,"Bates, J.R., Some considerations of the concept of climate feedback (2007) Q J R Meteorol Soc, 133, pp. 545-560; Bode, H., Network analysis and feedback amplifier design (1945) Van Nostrand, p. 551; Boer, G.J., Yu, B., Climate sensitivity and response (2003) Clim Dyn, 20, pp. 415-429; Bony, S., How well do we understand and evaluate climate feedback processes?
