We examined relations between climatic variability and birth seasonality, offspring production, and infant sex ratios in two ateline primates, northern muriquis, and woolly monkeys. In both species, the annual birth season was delayed by dry conditions and El Niño years, and delayed birth seasons were linked to lower birth rates. Additionally, increased mean annual temperatures were associated with lower birth rates for northern muriquis. Offspring sex ratios varied with climatic conditions in both species, but in different ways: directly in woolly monkeys and indirectly in northern muriquis. Woolly monkeys displayed an increase in the proportion of males among offspring in association with El Niño events, whereas in northern muriquis, increases in the proportion of males among offspring were associated with delayed onset of the birth season, which itself was related, although weakly, to warm, dry conditions. These results illustrate that global warming, increased drought frequency, and changes in the frequency of El Niño events could limit primate reproductive output, threatening the persistence and recovery of ateline primate populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Ateline primates; El Niño southern oscillation; Extrinsic modification hypothesis; Global climate change; Sex ratio","birth rate; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; primate; reproductive success; seasonality; sex ratio; Lagothrix; Primates",,,,,,"Becovitch, F., Female weight and reproductive condition in a population of olive baboons (Papio anubis) (1987) American Journal of Primatology, 12, pp. 189-195; Boinski, S., Birth synchrony in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri oerstedi) (1987) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 21, pp. 393-400. , a strategy to reduce neonatal predation; Brown, G., Sex-biased investment in nonhuman primates (2001) Animal Behaviour, 61, pp. 683-694. , can Trivers & Willard's theory be tested?; Burnham, K., Anderson, D., (1998) Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Campbell, C., Primate sexuality and reproduction (2007) Primates in Perspective, pp. 423-437. , In: (eds CampbellC, FuentesA, MacKinnonK, PangerM, BearderS) - Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Caughley, G., Caughley, J., Estimating median date of birth (1974) Journal of Wildlife Management, 38, pp. 552-556; Chapman, C., Chapman, L., Richardson, K., Sex ratio in primates (1989) Oikos, 56, pp. 132-134. , a test of the local resource competition hypothesis; Clark, B., Sex ratio and local resource competition in a prosimian primate (1978) Science, 201, pp. 163-165; Clutton-Brock, T., Iason, G., Sex ratio variation in mammals (1986) Quarterly Review of Biology, 61, pp. 339-374; Crockett, C., Rudran, R., Red howler monkey birth data I (1987) American Journal of Primatology, 13, pp. 347-368. , seasonal variation; Crockett, C., Rudran, R., Red howler monkey birth data II (1987) American Journal of Primatology, 13, pp. 369-384. , interannual, habitat, and sex comparisons; Di Fiore, A., Campbell, C., The atelines (2007) Primates in Perspective, pp. 109-151. , variation in ecology, behavior, and social organization.
