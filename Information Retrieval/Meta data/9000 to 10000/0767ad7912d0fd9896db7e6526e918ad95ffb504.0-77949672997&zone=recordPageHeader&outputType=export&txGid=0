Changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation due to global climate change may further alter plant community composition in desert regions. In this study, we assessed changes in species richness and plant density at the community, functional group, and species level in response to variation in the magnitude of natural seasonal precipitation and 25% increases in seasonal precipitation [e.g., supplemental watering in summer, winter, or summer and winter (SW)] over a 5-year period in a sotol grassland in the Chihuahuan Desert. Community species richness was higher with increasing winter precipitation while community plant density increased with greater amounts of winter and summer precipitation, suggesting winter precipitation was important for species recruitment and summer precipitation promoted growth of existing species. Herb and grass density increased with increasing winter and summer precipitation, but only grass density showed a significant response to supplemental watering treatments (SW treatment plots had higher grass density). Shrubs and succulents did not exhibit changes in richness or density in response to natural or supplemental precipitation. In this 5-year study, changes in community species richness and density were driven by responses of herb and grass species that favored more frequent small precipitation events, shorter inter-pulse duration, and higher soil moisture. However, due to the long life spans of the shrub and succulent species within this community, 5 years may be insufficient to accurately evaluate their response to variable timing and magnitude of precipitation in this mid-elevation grassland. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Chihuahuan Desert; Grasslands; Plant density; Plant species richness; Seasonal precipitation","rain; climate change; community response; ecosystem dynamics; functional group; grassland; growth rate; plant community; population density; precipitation intensity; recruitment (population dynamics); soil moisture; species richness; article; biodiversity; desert climate; growth, development and aging; physiology; Poaceae; population density; population dynamics; season; temperature; Biodiversity; Desert Climate; Poaceae; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Rain; Seasons; Temperature; Chihuahuan Desert; Dasylirion",,,,,,"Abbott, L., Grassland ecology and diversity (2006) Grasslands Ecosystems, Endangered Species, and Sustainable Ranching in the Mexico-US Borderlands, pp. 11-13. , Conference proceedings June 2006; Adler, P.B., Levine, J.M., Contrasting relationships between precipitation and species richness in space and time (2007) Oikos, 116, pp. 221-232; Anderson, J.E., Inouye, R.S., Landscape-scale changes in plant species abundance and biodiversity of a sagebrush steppe over 45 years (2001) Ecol Monogr, 71, pp. 531-556; Bassirirad, H., Tremmel, D.C., Virginia, R.A., Reynolds, J.F., de Soyza, A.G., Brunell, M.H., Short-term patterns in water and nitrogen acquisition by two desert shrubs following a simulated summer rain (1999) Plant Ecol, 145, pp. 27-36; Bates, J.D., Svejcar, T., Miller, R.F., Angell, R.A., The effects of precipitation timing on sagebrush steppe vegetation (2006) J Arid Environ, 64, pp. 670-697; Bell, C., McIntyre, N., Cox, S., Tissue, D., Zak, J., Soil microbial responses to temporal variations of moisture and temperature in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland (2008) Microb Ecol, 56, pp. 153-167; Briones, O., Montana, C., Ezcurra, E., Competitive intensity as a function of resource availability in a semiarid ecosystem (1998) Oecologia, 116, pp. 365-372; Buonopane, M., Huenneke, L.F., Remmenga, M., Community response to removals of plant functional groups and species from a Chihuahuan Desert shrubland (2005) Oikos, 110, pp. 67-80; Cleland, E.E., Chiariello, N.R., Loarie, S.R., Mooney, H.A., Field, C.B., Diverse responses of phenology to global changes in a grassland ecosystem (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 103, pp. 13740-13744; Correll, D.S., Johnston, M.C., (1979) Manual of the Vascular Plants of Texas, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Dougherty, R.L., Lauenroth, W.K., Singh, J.S., Response of a grassland cactus to frequency and size of rainfall events in a North American shortgrass steppe (1996) J Ecol, 84, pp. 177-183; Ehleringer, J.R., Schwinning, S., Gebauer, R., Water use in arid land ecosystems (1999) Advances in Plant Physiological Ecology, pp. 347-365. , M.
