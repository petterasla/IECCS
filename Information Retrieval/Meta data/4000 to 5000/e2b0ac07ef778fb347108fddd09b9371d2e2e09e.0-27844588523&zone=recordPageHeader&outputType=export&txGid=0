The experiment fields were divided into three plots for three different treatments, one with continuous flooded and applying urea (CU), one with continuous flooded and applying slow-releasing urea (CS), and one with intermittent irrigation and applying urea (IU). Under the same fertilization application, compared with continuous flooded, intermittent irrigation can significantly reduce CH4 emission and increase N2O emission. But, integrated global warming potentials (GWPS) of CH4 and N2O emission were reduced greatly, while rice yield was not affected. So, the intermittent irrigation is an effective measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields. The amount of CH4 emission during rice-growing season for the three treatments was all much lower than that from any other region in China. There was a trade-off relationship between CH4 and N2O emissions. We also measured the numbers of methanogens, methanotrophs, nitrifiers and denitrifers from rice field at various growth stages in 2001. Bacteria populations were estimated by the most probable number (MPN) method. Regression analyses show CH4 emissions were closely related to methanogens population for all the three treatments. There was a positive correlation between denitrifiers population level and N2O emission in the treatment of IU. © Springer 2005.","Black soil; Denitrifiers; Methane; Methanogens; Methanotrophs; Nitrifiers; Nitrous oxide; Rice field","biogenic emission; methane; nitrous oxide; paddy field; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methanobacteriales",,,,,,"Cai, Z.C., Effects of water regime on CO2CH4N2O emissions and overall potential for greenhouse effect caused by emitted gases (1999) Acta Pedol.
