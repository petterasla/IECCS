Wood is a significant source of household heating in Norway, and a comparative life cycle assessment of a wood-based heating system using an old and a modern stove was conducted to estimate the total life cycle benefits associated with the change from old to new combustion technology. Materials and methods: The study uses a new approach to complete the inventory. Input-output data are used in combination with the Leontief price model to estimate inputs of products and services from the background economy to the birch wood supply chain. Results: When comparing new and old stove technology, the results show that the new technology contributes to a significantly improved performance (28-80%) for all types of environmental impact studied. As there is a large share of old wood stoves still in use, replacing the old stoves with new ones can lead to substantial reductions in environmental impacts, especially impacts affecting human health. The use phase, i.e., wood combustion, is responsible for over 60% of the impact within all categories. Both the old and new stove provide heating with emissions of greenhouse gases ranging from one third (new stove, ∼80 g CO 2-eq/kWh) to half (old stove, ∼110 g CO2-eq/kWh) of the impacts compared to electricity use from the Nordic electricity mix (∼210 g CO2-eq/kWh) to heat the house. Discussion: Combustion of the wood is found to be most important for all types of impacts, even for global warming, where the CO2 emissions from combustion are treated as ""climate neutral."" Products of incomplete combustion are the reason for this, as well as the high contribution to other impact categories. Emission factors for these substances are subject to high uncertainty. Although the combustion phase is the most important stage in the life cycle, transportation distances can play an important role. To render wood as environmentally benign as possible, one should thus seek to shorten the distances from producer to consumer. Conclusions: There is a significant difference in the life cycle performance of a wood stove using modern technology versus older technologies within all impact categories. In addition, there is a preference to use locally produced firewood over wood transported over long distances. Recommendations and perspectives: A strong emphasis on phasing out old woodstoves should be maintained and is well justified. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Birch wood; Household heating; LCA; Norway; Wood stove; Wood-based household heating","domestic chemical; article; combustion; controlled study; economic aspect; electricity; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; intermethod comparison; life cycle assessment; Norway; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; technology; wood",,,,,,"Athanassiadis, D., Energy consumption and exhaust emissions in mechanized timber harvesting operations in Sweden (2000) Sci Total Environ, 255, pp. 135-143; Berg, S., Lindholm, E.L., Energy use and environmental impacts of forest operations in Sweden (2005) Journal of Cleaner Production, 13, pp. 33-42; Boman, C., Nordin, A., Öhman, M., Boström, D., Westerholm, R., (2005) Emissions from Small-scale Combustion of Biomass Fuels-extensive Quantification and Characterization, , http://www.itm.su.se/bhm/rapporter/emission/126481o219061.pdf, Technical Report STEM-BHM (P12648-1 and P21906-1), Energy Technology and Thermal Process Chemistry, Umeå University, Sweden & Analytical Chemistry, Arrhenius Laboratory Stockholm University, Sweden; Bullard, I., Clark, W., Herendeen, R.A., The energy cost of goods and services (1975) Energy Policy, 30 (4), pp. 268-278; Dones, R., Bauer, C., Bolliger, R., Burger, B., Faist Emmenegger, M., Frischknecht, R., Heck, T., Röder, A., Life cycle inventories of energy systems: Results for current systems in Switzerland and other UCTE countries (2007) Ecoinvent Report 5, , Paul Scherrer Institut Villigen, Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories, Dübendorf, CH; Enova, S.F., (2008) Household Heating Equipment Subsidies in Norway, , http://tilskudd2006.enova.no/; Finstad, A., Haakonsen, G., Rypdal, K., (2002) Utslipp Til Luft Av Dioksiner i Norge-Dokumentasjon Av Metode Og Resultater, , Technical report, Statistics Norway; Finstad, A., Flugsrud, K., Haakonsen, G., Aasestad, K., (2003) Vedforbruk, Fyringsvaner Og Svevestøv.
