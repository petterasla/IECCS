The severity index [1] related to the air-frost index [2] was used to characterize the local climatic conditions favoring the formation of permafrost. Anthropogenic forcing scenarios involving a general increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration with and without anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emissions were considered. The model simulations were compared to paleoclimatic reconstructions of the southern boundaries of different permafrost zones for two past warm periods with different degrees of global warming. The method proposed for comparing the model results between themselves and with paleoclimatic data showed that the sensitivity of the continuous permafrost area to global warming differs substantially in different models but is virtually independent of the applied radiation forcing scenarios in an individual model. For the scenario with a constant atmospheric aerosol content, the results of the atmospheric general circulation models were compared to those produced by the IFA RAN climate model of intermediate complexity, whose sensitivity was found to be similar to the sensitivity of the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model. A comparison of the ECHAM4/OPYC3 results to paleoclimatic reconstructions showed that the southern boundary of continuous permafrost over the former USSR region in the Holocene optimum (6000 before present (BP) is similar to the conditions in the mid-21st century as predicted by the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model with allowance for aerosol emissions. In the absence of aerosol emissions, these conditions were found to be in better agreement with the permafrost distribution during the Eemian interglacial (125 000 BP).",,"atmospheric general circulation model; global warming; greenhouse gas; paleoclimate; permafrost",,,,,,"Nechaev, V.P., Some relations between permafrost and climatic parameters and their paleogeographic significance (1981) Voprosy paleogeografii pleistotsena lednikovykh i periglyatsial'nykh oblastei (Problems in the Paleography of the Pleistocene of Glacial and Periglacial Regions), pp. 211-220. , Velichko, A.A. and Grichuk, V.P., Eds., Moscow: Nauka; Anisimov, O.A., Nel'son, F.E., Application of mathematical models to studies of the climate-permafrost relationship (1990) Meteorol.
