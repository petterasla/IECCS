As a result these models underestimate potential global warming damages. Here, a more realistic, but practical, carbon cycle parameterization is developed that can be incorporated within an optimizing climate-economy model framework. This method is utilized in conjunction with the DICE model (Nordhaus, 1994) to estimate optimal reductions in CO2 emissions. The results are shown to be extremely sensitive to the pure rate of time preference, ρ. For ρ=3% (Nordhaus' preferred value), our model predicts an optimal CO2 emission reduction of 13% by the year 2045, as compared to 11% in the original DICE model. But, for ρ=0% the optimal emissions reduction rises to 79% in the year 2045 and to 97% by the year 2200. We argue that energy policy should be guided by the ρ=0% results for both economic and ethical reasons. A steady-state analysis performed using the DICE model supports the argument that large fractional reductions in CO2 emissions should be undertaken. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","CO2 emissions; Optimal reductions","carbon dioxide; sea water; article; atmosphere; chemistry; climate; computer simulation; forecasting; greenhouse effect; management; statistical model; theoretical model; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Computer Simulation; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Economic; Models, Theoretical; Policy Making; Seawater; air pollution",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Azar, C., Sterner, T., Discounting and distributional considerations in the context of global warming (1996) Ecological Economics, , forthcoming; Brooke, A., Kendrick, D., Meeraus, A., (1988) GAMS: a User's Guide, , The Scientific Press, Redwood City, CA; Broome, J., (1992) Counting the Cost of Global Change, , White Horse Press, Cambridge, UK; Caldeira, K., Kasting, J.F., Insensitivity of global warming potentials to carbon dioxide emission scenarios (1993) Nature, 366, pp. 251-253; D'Arge, R.C., Schulze, W.D., Brookshire, D.S., Carbon dioxide and intergenerational choice (1982) AEA Papers and Proc., 72, pp. 251-256; Davis, M.B., Ecological systems and dynamics (1988) Toward an Understanding of Global Change, pp. 69-106. , National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Fankhauser, S., (1995) Valuing Climate Change - the Economics of the Greenhouse, p. 180. , Earthscan Pub., London; Gore, A., (1993) Earth in the Balance - Ecology and the Human Spirit, p. 407. , Penguin Books, New York; Grubb, M., Chapuis, T., Duong, M.H., The economics of changing course - Implications of adaptability and inertia for optimal climate policy (1995) Energy Policy, 23 (4-5), pp. 417-432; Hall, D.C., Geoeconomic time and global warming: Renewable energy and conservation policy (1996) International J. of Social Economics, , forthcoming; Hamm, G.L., Simple models of the interactions among energy, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the economy (1984) Proc. of the 6th Annual N.
