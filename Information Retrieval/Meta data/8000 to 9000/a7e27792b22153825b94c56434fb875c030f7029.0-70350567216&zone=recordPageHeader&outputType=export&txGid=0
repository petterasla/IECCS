However, the net benefit of carbon sequestration in wetlands in terms of a reduction in global warming forcing has often been questioned because of potentially greater emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). We compared gas emissions (N2O, CH4, carbon dioxide [CO2]) and soil moisture and temperature from eight cropland and eight restored grassland wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region from May to October, 2003, to better understand the atmospheric carbon mitigation potential of restored wetlands. Results show that carbon dioxide contributed the most (90%) to net-GHG flux, followed by CH4 (9%) and N2O (1%). Fluxes of N2O, CH4, CO2, and their combined global warming potential (CO2 equivalents) did not significantly differ between cropland and grassland wetlands. The seasonal pattern in flux was similar in cropland and grassland wetlands with peak emissions of N2O and CH4 occurring when soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) was 40-60% and &gt;60%, respectively; negative CH4 fluxes were observed when WFPS approached 40%. Negative CH4 fluxes from grassland wetlands occurred earlier in the season and were more pronounced than those from cropland sites because WFPS declined more rapidly in grassland wetlands; this decline was likely due to higher infiltration and evapotranspiration rates associated with grasslands. Our results suggest that restoring cropland wetlands does not result in greater emissions of N2O and CH4, and therefore would not offset potential soil carbon sequestration. These findings, however, are limited to a small sample of seasonal wetlands with relatively short hydroperiods. A more comprehensive assessment of the GHG mitigation potential of restored wetlands should include a diversity of wetland types and land-use practices and consider the impact of variable climatic cycles that affect wetland hydrology.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Global warming potential; Land use; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Soil temperature; Water-filled pore space","Carbon sequestration; Global warming potential; Nitrous oxide; Soil temperature; Water-filled pore space; Anesthetics; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Groundwater; Hydrology; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Restoration; Soil moisture; Underwater soils; Water supply; Wetlands; agricultural emission; carbon sequestration; climate cycle; evapotranspiration; global warming; greenhouse gas; habitat restoration; hydroperiod; methane; nitrous oxide; pore space; prairie; seasonality; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil temperature; wetland management; North America; Prairie Pothole Region",,,,,,"Armentano, T.V., Menges, E.S., Patterns of change in the carbon balance of organic soil-wetlands of the temperate zone (1986) Journal of Ecology, 74, pp. 755-774; Bedard-Haughn, A., Matson, A.L., Pennock, D.J., Land use effects on gross nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, and N2O emissions in ephemeral wetlands (2006) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 38, pp. 3398-3406; Bluemle, J.P., The Face of North Dakota: The Geologic Story (2000) North Dakota Geological Survey Educational Series, 26. , third ed, Bismarck, ND, 210 pp; Bridgham, S.D., Megonigal, J.P., Keller, J.K., Bliss, N.B., Trettin, C., The carbon balance of North American wetlands (2006) Wetlands, 26, pp. 889-916; Bubier, J.L., Moore, T.R., Roulet, N.T., Methane emissions from wetlands in the midboreal region of northern Ontario, Canada (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 2240-2254; Cihacek, L.J., Ulmer, M.G., Estimated soil organic carbon losses from long-term crop-fallow in the Northern Great Plains of the USA (1995) Soil Management and Greenhouse Effect, pp. 85-92. , Lal R., Kimble J.M., Levine E., and Stewart B.A. (Eds), CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL; Clair, T.A., Arp, P., Moore, T.R., Dalva, M., Meng, F.-R., Gaseous carbon dioxide and methane, as well as dissolved organic carbon losses from a small temperate wetland under a changing climate (2002) Environmental Pollution, 116, pp. 143-148; Conant, R.T., Paustian, K., Elliott, E.T., Grassland management and conversion into grassland: effects on soil carbon (2001) Ecological Applications, 11, pp. 343-355; Coolman, R.M., Robarge, W.P., Sampling nitrous oxide emissions from humid tropical ecosystems (1995) Journal of Biogeography, 22, pp. 381-391; Davidson, E.A., Keller, M., Erickson, H.E., Verchot, L.V., VeldKamp, E., Testing a conceptual model of soil emissions of nitrous and nitric oxides (2000) BioScience, 50, pp. 667-680; Desjardins, R.L., Smith, W., Grant, B., Campbell, C., Riznek, R., Management strategies to sequester carbon in agricultural soils and to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (2005) Climatic Change, 70, pp. 283-297; Dise, N.B., Methane emission from Minnesota peatlands: spatial and seasonal variability (1993) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 7, pp. 123-142; Dörr, H., Katruff, L., Levin, I., Soil texture parameterization of the methane uptake in aerated soils (1993) Chemosphere, 26, pp. 697-713; Euliss Jr., N.H., Mushet, D.M., Wrubleski, D.A., Wetlands of the Prairie Pothole Region: invertebrate species composition, ecology, and management (1999) Invertebrates in Freshwater Wetlands of North America: Ecology and Management, pp. 471-514. , Batzer D.P., Rader R.B., and Wissinger S.A.
