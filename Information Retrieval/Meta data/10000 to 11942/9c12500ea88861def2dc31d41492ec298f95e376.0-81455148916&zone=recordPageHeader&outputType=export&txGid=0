However, these glaciers suffer from strong mass losses in the recent years because of global warming. From 2008 to 2009, a large-scale scientific expedition has been carried out in this region. As an individual reference glacier, the tongue area of Qingbingtan glacier No. 72 was measured by the high precise Real Time Kinematic-Global Position System (RTK-GPS). In this paper, changes of the tongue area of Qingbingtan glacier No. 72 has been studied based on topographic map, remote sensing image and the survey during 2008#x2013;2009 field campaign. Results indicated that the ice surface-elevation of the tongue area changed - 0.22±0.14 m a-1 from 1964 to 2008. The estimated loss in ice volume was 0.014±0.009 km3, which represented a ~20 % decrease from the 1964 volume and was equivalent to average annual mass balance of -0.20±0.12 m water equivalent for the tongue area during 1964-2008. Terminus retreated by 1852 m, approximately 41 m a-1, with the area reduction of 1. 533 km2 (0.034 km2 a-1) from 1964 to 2009. Furthermore, the annual velocity reached to ~70 m a-1. Comparing with the other monitored glaciers in the eastern Tianshan Mountains, Qingbingtan glacier No. 72 experienced more intensive in shrinkage, which resulted from the combined effects of climate change and glacier dynamic, providing evidence of the response to climatic warming. © 2011 Science Press and Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ice surface-elevation change; Ice velocity; Qingbingtan glacier No72; Tianshan Mountains; Tomor region",,,,,,,"Barry, R.G., The status of research on glaciers and global glacier recession: a review (2006) Progress in Physical Geography, 30, pp. 285-306; Bauder, A., Funk, M., Huss, M., Ice-volume changes of selected glaciers in the Swiss Alps since the end of the 19th century (2007) Annals of Glaciology, 46, pp. 145-149; Bown, F., Rivera, A., Climate changes and recent glacier behaviour in the Chilean Lake District (2007) Global and Planetary Change, 59, pp. 79-86; (2006) China Meteorological Administration, , ClimateEnvironment in China, Beijing: Science Press; Duval, P., The role of the water content on the creep rate of polycrystalline ice (1977) IAHS Publ., 118, pp. 29-33. , (Symposium at Grenoble 1975 - Isotopes and Impurities in Snow and Ice); Dyurgerov, M., (2002) Glacier Mass Balance and Regime: Data of Measurements and Analysis, 55. , INSTAAR Occasional Paper, Boulder, CO: University of Colorado.
