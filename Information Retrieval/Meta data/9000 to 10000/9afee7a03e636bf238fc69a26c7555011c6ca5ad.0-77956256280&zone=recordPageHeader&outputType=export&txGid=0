The study focuses on identifying and mapping suitable sites in eastern India through computation of rice aridity index from soils and climatic data and proposing suitability criteria model and assessing potential yield. This study gains further significance since aerobic rice cultivation could improve the upland production efficiency and helps reduction of greenhouse gases.","Aerobic rice; Rice aridity index; Suitability assessment model; Upland",,,,,,,"Viraktamath, B.C., Ilyas Ahmed, M., Singh, A.K., Hybrid rice for sustainable food security (2006) Indian Farming, pp. 25-30. , Special Issue on 2nd International Rice Congress; Budhar, M.N., Rajendran, R., Chandrasekaran, B., Integrated nutrient management for rice grown under SRI and aerobic situations (2006) Winter School on New Dimensions in Integrated Nutrient Management of Major Field Corps for Sustainable Crop Production, pp. 177-186. , (eds Raghjavaiah, et al.), Indian Council of Agriculture Research, New Delhi and Directorate of Oilseeds Research, Hyderabad; Jha, K.P., Moorthy, B.T.S., Rao, K.S., Rice (2002) Techniques and Management of Field Crop Production, pp. 6-40. , (ed.
