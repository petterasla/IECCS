It is usually obtained using linear principal component analysis, which produces the optimal, although somewhat restrictive, linear approximation to the SLP data. Here we use a recently introduced nonlinear principal component analysis to find the optimal nonlinear approximation to SLP data produced by a 1001 year integration of the CCCma coupled general circulation model (CGCM1). This approximation's associated time series is strongly bimodal and partitions the data into two distinct regimes. The first and more persistent regime describes a standing oscillation whose signature in the mid-troposphere is alternating amplification and attenuation of the climatological ridge over Northern Europe, with associated decreasing and increasing daily variance over Northern Eurasia. The second and more episodic regime describes a split-flow south of Greenland with much enhanced daily variance in the Arctic. In a 500 year integration with atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> stabilized at concentrations projected for year 2100, the occupation statistics of these preferred modes of variability change, such that the episodic split-flow regime occurs less frequently while the standing oscillation regime occurs more frequently.",,"atmospheric circulation; climate change; global warming; Northern Hemisphere; Approximation theory; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Greenhouse effect; Sea level; Troposphere; Arctic oscillation; Linear principal component analysis; Sea level pressure; Split flow; Global warming",,,,,,"Corti, S., Molteni, F., Palmer, T.N., Signature of recent climate change in frequencies of natural atmospheric regimes (1999) Nature, 398, pp. 799-802; Flato, G.M., Boer, G.J., Lee, W.G., McFarlane, N.A., Ramsden, D., Reader, M.C., Weaver, A.J., The Canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis global coupled model and its climate (1999) Climate Dynamics, , in press; Fyfe, J.C., Boer, G.J., Flato, G.M., The Arctic and Antarctic oscillations and their projected changes under global warming (1999) Geophys.
