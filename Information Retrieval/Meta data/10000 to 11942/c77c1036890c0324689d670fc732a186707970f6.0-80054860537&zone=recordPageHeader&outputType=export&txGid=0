This paper discusses the driving forces influencing China's CO2 emissions based on Path-STIRPAT model-a method combining Path analysis with STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology) model. The analysis shows that GDP per capita (A), industrial structure (IS), population (P), urbanization level (R) and technology level (T) are the main factors influencing China's CO2 emissions, which exert an influence interactively and collaboratively. The sequence of the size of factors' direct influence on China's CO2 emission is A&gt;T&gt;P&gt;R&gt;IS, while that of factors' total influence is A&gt;R&gt;P&gt;T&gt;IS. One percent increase in A, IS, P, R and T leads to 0.44, 1.58, 1.31, 1.12 and -1.09 percentage change in CO2 emission totally, where their direct contribution is 0.45, 0.07, 0.63, 0.08, 0.92, respectively. Improving T is the most important way for CO2 reduction in China. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","China; CO2 emission; Influence factor","China; Driving forces; Industrial structures; Influence factors; Path analysis; Per capita; Energy utilization; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; global warming; Gross Domestic Product; modeling; urbanization; China",,,,,,"Bongaarts, J., Population growth and global warming (1992) Population and Development Review, 18, pp. 299-319; CESY China Energy Statistical Yearbook, National Bureau of Statistics of China (1991), National Development and Reform CommissionCramer, J.C., Population growth and air quality in California (1998) Demography, 35, pp. 45-56; CSY China Statistical Yearbook (1992), National Bureau of Statistics of ChinaDai, Y.D., (2009) China's Low Carbon Development Pathways by 2050, , Science Press, Beijing; Dietz, T., Rosa, E.A., Rethinking the environmental impacts of population, affluence, and technology (1994) Human Ecology Review, 1, pp. 277-300; Dietz, T., Rosa, E.A., Effects of population and affluence on CO2 emissions (1997) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 94, pp. 175-179; Ehrlich, P.R., Holdren, J.P., Impact of population growth (1971) Science, 171, pp. 1212-1217; Finney, J.M., Indirect effects in path analysis (1972) Sociological Methods and Research, 1 (2), pp. 175-185; Holdren, J.P., Ehrlich, P.R., Human population and the global environment (1974) American Scientist, 62 (3), pp. 282-292; Shi, A., The impact of population pressure on global carbon dioxide emissions, 1975-1996: evidence from pooled cross-country data (2003) Ecological Economics, 44, pp. 29-42; Shoufu, L., Dingtan, Z., Dora, M., Analysis of the environmental impact of China based on STIRPAT model (2009) Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 29, pp. 341-347; Soulé, P.T., DeHart, J.L., (1998) Assessing IPAT using production-and consumption-based measures of I.
