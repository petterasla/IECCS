Soil ecosystems can directly and indirectly respond to climate change. For example, warming directly alters microbial communities by increasing their activity. Climate change may also alter plant community composition, thus indirectly altering the soil communities that depend on their inputs. To better understand how climate change may directly and indirectly alter soil ecosystem functioning, we investigated old-field plant community and soil ecosystem responses to single and combined effects of elevated [CO2], warming, and precipitation in Tennessee (USA). Specifically, we collected soils at the plot level (plant community soils) and beneath dominant plant species (plant-specific soils). We used microbial enzyme activities and soil nematodes as indicators for soil ecosystem functioning. Our study resulted in two main findings: (1) Overall, while there were some interactions, water, relative to increases in [CO2] and warming, had the largest impact on plant community composition, soil enzyme activity, and soil nematodes. Multiple climate-change factors can interact to shape ecosystems, but in our study, those interactions were largely driven by changes in water. (2) Indirect effects of climate change, via changes in plant communities, had a significant impact on soil ecosystem functioning, and this impact was not obvious when looking at plant community soils. Climate-change effects on enzyme activities and soil nematode abundance and community structure strongly differed between plant community soils and plant-specific soils, but also within plant-specific soils. These results indicate that accurate assessments of climate-change impacts on soil ecosystem functioning require incorporating the concurrent changes in plant function and plant community composition. Climate-change-induced shifts in plant community composition will likely modify or counteract the direct impact of atmospheric and climate change on soil ecosystem functioning, and hence, these indirect effects should be taken into account when predicting the manner in which global change will alter ecosystem functioning. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Elevated [co2]; Extracellular enzymes; Festuca pratense; Global warming; Lespedeza cuneata; Multifactor experiment; Nematodes; Oak ridge; Old fields; Open-top chambers; Precipitation; Redundancy analysis; Tennessee; USA","carbon dioxide; enzyme; water; abundance; atmospheric dynamics; carbon dioxide; climate effect; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem function; ecosystem response; enzyme activity; global warming; grass; microbial activity; microbial community; nematode; open-top chamber; plant community; precipitation assessment; soil ecosystem; soil fauna; animal; article; bacterium; chemistry; classification; climate change; ecosystem; enzymology; fungus; metabolism; microbiology; nematode; physiology; plant; soil; time; Animals; Bacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Enzymes; Fungi; Nematoda; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Time Factors; Water; Tennessee; United States; Festuca; Lespedeza cuneata; Nematoda",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Enzymes; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Antoninka, A., Wolf, J.E., Bowker, M.B., Classen, A.T., Johnson, N.C., Linking above- And belowground responses to global change at community and ecosystem scales (2009) Global Change Biology, 15, pp. 514-520; Austin, E.E., Castro, H.F., Schadt, C.W., Sides, K.T., Classen, A.T., Assessment of 10 years of CO2 fumigation on soil microbial communities and function in a sweetgum plantation (2009) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 41, pp. 514-520; Ayres, E., Wall, D.H., Simmons, B.L., Field, C.B., Milchunas, D.G., Morgan, J.A., Roy, J., Belowground nematode herbivores are resistant to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations in grassland ecosystems (2008) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 40, pp. 978-985; Bardgett, R.D., Freeman, C., Ostle, N.J., Microbial contributions to climate change through carbon cycle feedbacks (2008) ISME Journal, 2, pp. 805-814; Conant, R.T., Steinweg, J.M., Haddix, M.L., Paul, E.A., Plante, A.F., Six, J., Experimental warming shows that decomposition temperature sensitivity increases with soil organic matter recalcitrance (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 2384-2391; Cotrufo, M.E., Ineson, P., Effects of enhanced atmospheric CO2 and nutrient supply on the quality and subsequent decomposition of fine roots of Betula pendula Roth and Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carr (1995) Plant and Soil, 170, pp. 267-277; Davidson, E.A., Janssens, I.A., Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change (2006) Nature, 440 (7081), pp. 165-173. , DOI 10.1038/nature04514, PII N04514; De Boeck, H.J., Lemmens, C.M.H.M., Zavalloni, C., Gielen, B., Maichair, S., Carnol, M., Mercks, R., Nijs, I., Biomass production in experimental grasslands of different species richness during three years of climate warming (2008) Biogeosciences, 5, pp. 585-594; De Deyn, G.B., Cornelissen, J.H.C., Bardgett, R.D., Plant functional traits and soil carbon sequestration in contrasting biomes (2008) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 516-531; Dermody, O., Mucking through multifactor experiments: Design and analysis of multifactor studies in global change research (2006) New Phytologist, 172, pp. 598-600; Diaz, S., Cabido, M., Plant functional types and ecosystem function in relation to global change (1997) Journal of Vegetation Science, 8 (4), pp. 463-474; Drigo, B., Kowalchuk, G.A., Yergeau, E., Bezemer, T.M., Boschker, H.T.S., Van Veen, J.A., Impact of elevated carbon dioxide on the rhizosphere communities of Carex arenaria and Festuca rubra (2007) Global Change Biology, 13 (11), pp. 2396-2410. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01445.x; Dukes, J.S., Hungate, B.A., Elevated carbon dioxide and litter decomposition in California annual grasslands: Which mechanisms matter?
