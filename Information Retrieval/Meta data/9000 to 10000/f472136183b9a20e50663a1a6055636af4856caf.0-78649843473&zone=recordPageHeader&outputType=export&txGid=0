As input data the forest inventory data for the Manturovskii forestry of the Kostroma region were used. It has been shown that increase of mid-annual temperatures and precipitation influence the redistribution of carbon and nitrogen supply in organic form: supply increase of these elements in phytomass simultaneously with depletion of them in soil occurred. The most carbon and nitrogen accumulation in forest ecosystems occurs in the scenario without felling. In addition, in this scenario only the ecosystems of the modeling territory function as a carbon sink; in the other two scenarios (with selective and clear cutting) they function as a source of carbon. Climate changes greatly influence the decomposition rate of organic matter in soil, which leads to increased emission of carbon dioxide. The second consequence of the increase in the destruction rate is nitrogen increase in the soil in a form available for plants that entails productivity increase of stands. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Alekseev, V.A., Markov, M.V., (2003) Statisticheskie Dannye O Lesnom Fonde I Izmenenie Produktivnosti Lesov Rossii Vo Vtoroi Polovine XX Veka, , (Statistical Data on the Forest Reserves and Changes in the Forest Productivity in the Second Half of the XX Century), St. Petersburg: S.-Peterb.
