The framework bridges recent applications of input-output analysis to conduct environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), with seminal work in production economics. In the latter, product design, production planning, and scheduling problems are frequently formulated as input-output models with substitution, and subsequently analyzed and solved as linear programs. The use of linear programming provides an appealing theory and computational framework to support decision making, as well as to conduct sensitivity analysis Methods In this paper, we explore the benefits of integrating LCA within a linear programming (LP) framework and present a case study where we consider a hypothetical advertiser located in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, who wishes to allocate a predetermined budget to place ads in either the print or online versions of a high-circulation, local newspaper. We formulate the problem of finding an advertising strategy that minimizes global warming potential (GWP), subject to demand and budget constraints. We then solve the problem and evaluate the optimal strategy in terms of discharges of component greenhouse gases, and in terms of requirements imposed on various energy sources. We also analyze the sensitivity of the optimal advertising strategy (and associated global warming potential) to perturbations in the model parameters and constraints. Results and discussion By embedding LCA within an LP formulation, we are able to examine the relationships between economic and environmental factors inherent within decisions to use specific products or services. Specifically, the advertiser finds that each strategy contains tradeoffs among and between environmental and monetary costs. A disaggregate comparison of greenhouse gas release and energy consumption among strategies highlights the variation between these factors and the potential dangers of aggregation. Sensitivity analysis gives us marginal costs (per dollar and per person) of GWP in the optimal solution. These and other managerial insights presented highlight the complex tradeoffs necessary for environmentally conscious, sustainable decision making. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Environmental life cycle assessment; Input-output analysis; Linear programming; Print vs. online advertising; Product design; Production planning and scheduling","advertizing; air pollution control; article; controlled study; decision support system; energy consumption; environmental economics; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; financial management; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; mathematical computing; priority journal; process design; process optimization; quality control; resource allocation; sensitivity analysis; United States",,,,,,"Azapagic, A., Clift, R., Life cycle assessment and linear programming - Environmental optimisation of product system (1995) Comput Chem Eng, 19 (SUPPL.), pp. 229-234. , 10.1016/0098-1354(95)87041-5; Azapagic, A., Clift, R., The application of life cycle assessment to process optimisation (1999) Comput Chem Eng, 23, pp. 1509-1526. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXhslWitw%3D%3D 10.1016/S0098-1354(99)00308-7; (2008) Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA), , http://www.eiolca.net, Carnegie Mellon University Green Design Institute US 1997 Industry Benchmark model [Internet] Accessed 1 January 2008; (2008) Audience and Circulation, , http://www.ctmgadvertise.com/audcirc/index.html, Chicago Tribune Media Group Accessed 30 November 2008; Dantzig, G., Programming of interdepending activities ii: Mathematical model (1949) Econometrica, 17 (3-4), pp. 200-211. , 10.2307/1905523; Facanha, C., Horvath, A., Evaluation of life-cycle air emission factors of freight transportation (2007) Environmental Science and Technology, 41 (20), pp. 7138-7144. , DOI 10.1021/es070989q; Finkbeiner, M., Inaba, A., Tan, R., Christiansen, K., Klueppel, H., The new international standards for life cycle assessment: ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 (2006) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 11 (2), pp. 80-85. , 10.1065/lca2006.02.002; Hackman, S., Leachman, R., A general framework for modeling production (1989) Manage Sci, 35 (4), pp. 478-495. , 10.1287/mnsc.35.4.478; Hendrickson, C., Lave, L., Matthews, H., (2006) Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input-output Approach, , RFF Press Washington, DC; Hertwich, E., Life cycle approaches to sustainable consumption: A critical review (2005) Environ Sci Technol, 39 (13), pp. 4673-4684. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXkslSntro%3D 10.1021/es0497375; Hillier, F.S., Lieberman, G.L., (2010) Introduction to Operations Research, , McGraw-Hill New York, NY; Hopp, W., Spearman, M., (2000) Factory Physics: Foundations of Manufacturing Management, , McGraw-Hill New York, NY; Houghton, J., Ding, Y., Griggs, D., Noguer, M., Van Der Linden, P., Dai, X., Johnson, C., Maskell, K., (2001) Climate Change 2001: A Scientific Basis; Joshi, S., Product environmental life cycle assessment using input output techniques (2000) J Ind Ecol, 3 (23), pp. 95-120. , 10.1162/108819899569449; Kondo, Y., Nakamura, S., Evaluating alternative life-cycle strategies for electrical appliances by the waste input-output model (2004) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 9 (4), pp. 236-246. , 10.1007/BF02978599; Kondo, Y., Nakamura, S., Waste input-output linear programming model with its application to eco-efficiency analysis (2005) Economic Systems Research, 17 (4), pp. 393-408. , DOI 10.1080/09535310500283526, PII J721428343063; Koopmans, T., (1951) Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation: Proceedings of A Conference, , Wiley New York, NY; Lenzen, M., Errors in conventional and input-output-based life-cycle inventories (2001) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 4 (4), pp. 127-148. , DOI 10.1162/10881980052541981; Leontief, W., (1951) The Structure of the American Economy, pp. 1919-1939. , Oxford University Press New York, NY; Leontief, W., (1952) Studies in the Structure of the American Economy, , Oxford University Press New York, NY; Leontief, W., Environmental repercussions and the economic structure: An input-output approach (1970) Rev Econ Stat, 52 (3), pp. 262-271. , 10.2307/1926294; Mihelcic, J.R., Crittenden, J.C., Small, M.J., Shonnard, D.R., Hokanson, D.R., Zhang, Q., Chen, H., Schnoor, J.L., Sustainability Science and Engineering: The Emergence of a New Metadiscipline (2003) Environmental Science and Technology, 37 (23), pp. 5314-5324. , DOI 10.1021/es034605h; Miller, R., Blair, P., (1985) Input-output Analysis: Foundations and Extensions, , Prentice Hall, Inc.
