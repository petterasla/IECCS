Wind speed fluctuations cause high fluctuations in output power of wind turbine which cause fluctuations in fr and voltages of the MG in the islanding mode and originate stability problems. In this study, a new fuzzy logic pitch controller and an energy storage ultra capacitor are proposed and developed to smooth the output power of wind turbine and enhance MG's performance in islanding mode. These two proposed controllers are compared with the conventional PI pitch controller, which is usually used to control wind generation system when the wind speed exceeds a rated value. Obtained results proved that our two proposed strategies are effective for the MG performance improvement during islanding mode. All models and controllers are developed using Matlab ® Simulink ® environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
