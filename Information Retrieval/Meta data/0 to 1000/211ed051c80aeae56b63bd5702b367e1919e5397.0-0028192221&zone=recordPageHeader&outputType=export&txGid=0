Ambient air is expanded into a low-pressure detection chamber, and OH is both excited and detected using the A3Σ+(v″ = 0) → X2II(v"" = 0) transition near 308 nm. An injector upstream of the detection axis allows for the addition of reagent NO to convert ambient HO2 to OH using the fast reaction HO2 + NO → OH + NO2. Using recent advances in laser and detector technologies, this prototype instrument is able to detect less than 1 × 105 molecules cm-3 (0.004 pptv) of OH with an integration time of 30 s with negligible interferences. -from Authors",,"hydrogen peroxide; laser induced fluorescence; measurement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028192221
