The present rate of CO2 emissions will produce an atmospheric concentration in 100 years not experienced during the past 20 million years and water temperatures above those of the past interglacial 130 000 years before present. Human influences on water temperatures, seawater chemistry (toxic substances, nutrients and aragonite saturation), the spread of diseases, removal of species and food web alterations are presently changing reef ecology. A significant ecological reorganization is underway and changes include a reduction in calcifying and zooxanthellae-hosting organisms, their obligate symbionts, and species at higher trophic levels, with an increase in generalist species of low trophic level that are adapted to variable environments. Late-successional fleshy brown algae of low net productivity or non-commercial invertebrates such as sea urchins, starfish and coral-eating snails will dominate many reefs. These changes will be associated with a loss of both net benthic and fisheries production and inorganic carbonate deposition; this will reduce reef complexity, species richness, reef growth and increase shoreline erosion. To avert these changes management is needed at both global and local levels. Both levels need to reduce greenhouse gases and other waste emissions and renew efforts to improve resource management including restrictions on the use of resources and globalization of resource trade, run-off and waste production, and balancing potential reef production and resource consumption.","Carbon dioxide; Coral reefs; Fishing; Global change; Human influences; Management; Pollution; Sea level","Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Coral reefs; Reefs; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; sea water; coral reef; environmental conditions; environmental degradation; environmental impact; environmental management; future prospect; air pollutant; alga; article; calcification; carbon dioxide measurement; climate change; coral reef; ecology; environmental change; global change; greenhouse gas; invertebrate; nonhuman; sea level; sea urchin; symbiosis; temperature acclimatization; algae; Anthozoa; Asteroidea; Echinoidea; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Phaeophyceae",,"calcium carbonate, 13397-26-7, 13701-58-1, 14791-73-2, 471-34-1; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Acevedo, R., Preliminary observations on effects of the pesticides, carbaryl, naphthol, and chloropyrifos on the planulae of the hermatypic coral Pocillopora damicornis (1991) Pacific Science, 45, pp. 287-289; Acevedo, R., Morelock, J., Olivieri, R.A., Modification of coral reef zonation by terrigenous sediment stress (1989) Palaios, 4, pp. 92-100; Albritton, D.L., (2001) Summary for Policy Makers: A Report of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
