It is also considered to be a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and climate change. In this article, energy consumption in Bangladesh is analyzed and estimates are made of CO2 emission from combustion of fossil fuel (coal, gas, petroleum products) for the period 1977 to 1995. International Panel for Climate Change guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories were used in estimating CO2 emission. An analysis of energy data shows that the consumption of fossil fuels in Bangladesh is growing by more than 5% per year. The proportion of natural gas in total energy consumption is increasing, while that of petroleum products and coal is decreasing. The estimated total CO 2 release from all primary fossil fuels used in Bangladesh amounted to 5072 Gigagram (Gg) in 1977, and 14 423 Gg in 1995. The total amounts of CO2 released from petroleum products, natural gas, and coal in the period 1977-1995 were 83 026 Gg (50% of CO2 emission), 72 541 Gg (44% of CO2 emission), and 9545 Gg (6% CO2 emission), respectively. A trend in CO2 emission with projections to 2070 is generated. In 2070, total estimated CO2 emission will be 293 260 Gg with a current growth rate of 6.34% y-1. CO2 emission from fossil fuels is increasing. Petroleum products contribute the majority of CO2 emission load, and although the use of natural gas is increasing rapidly, its contribution to CO2 emission is less than that of petroleum products. The use of coal as well as CO2 emission from coal is expected to gradually decrease. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2006.",,"carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; atmospheric feature; carbon dioxide; climate change; combustion; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; article; Bangladesh; energy conservation; Bangladesh; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Fossil Fuels; Asia; Bangladesh; Eurasia; South Asia",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Fossil Fuels",,,,"(1997) Global Climate Change: Bangladesh Episode, , Department of Environment, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Dhaka; (1996) Statistical Yearbook of Bangladesh, , Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Dhaka; Bala, B.K., (1998) Energy and Environment: Modeling and Simulation, , Nova Science Publishers Inc., New York; Islam, M.N., (1995) Highlights of the National Energy Policy (NEP) of Bangladesh, , Presented at the Mechanical Engineering Division, Institute of Engineers, October 21; (1994) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 1-3. , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, United Nations Environment Programme, World Meteorological Organization, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and International Energy Agency, Geneva, Switzerland; (2000) Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Promoting Biomass Energy Technology in South Asia, , A proposal for PDF Block B Grant of GEF, RWEDP UNEP, Geneva, Switzerland; First submitted 24 Feb. 2003.
