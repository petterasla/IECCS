The display case refrigerator is a major supermarket appliance and its life expectancy could be as long as 10 years. In response to ever-more stringent regulations on energy efficiency, a prototype has been designed for minimizing energy use. Options such as insulation improvements using vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) and vacuum glazing (VG) were examined in a display case refrigerator by measuring heat loss. Results show that energy efficiency can be improved up to 30% by simultaneously mounting the VG and VIPs on the display case refrigerator. Additionally, the frost or sweat was eliminated for the energy-efficient display case refrigerator. © Taylor and Francis Inc.","Display case refrigerator; Energy efficiency; Heat loss; Thermal conductivity; Vacuum insulation panel","Energy efficiency; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Insulation; Refrigerators; Regulatory compliance; Vacuum applications; Heat loss; Vacuum insulations; Chemical plants; energy efficiency; heat loss; heat transfer; insulation; performance assessment; refrigerant",,,,,,"Collins, R.E., Fischer, A.C., Tang, J.Z., (1992) Sol.
