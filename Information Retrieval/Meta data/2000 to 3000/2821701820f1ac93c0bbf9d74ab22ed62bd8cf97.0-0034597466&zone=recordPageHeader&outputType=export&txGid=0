Here we show, using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem, that new shoot production of a dominant perennial shrub is doubled by a 50% increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in a high rainfall year. However, elevated CO2 does not enhance production in a drought year. We also found that above-ground production and seed rain of an invasive annual grass increases more at elevated CO2 than in several species of native annuals. Consequently, elevated CO2 might enhance the long-term success and dominance of exotic annual grasses in the region. This shift in species composition in favour of exotic annual grasses, driven by global change, has the potential to accelerate the fire cycle, reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem function in the deserts of western North America.",,"carbon dioxide; arid environment; biological invasion; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; primary production; article; biodiversity; climate; desert; ecosystem; grass; priority journal; species differentiation; angiosperm; desert climate; plant; Poaceae; United States; United States; Poaceae; Carbon Dioxide; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Nevada; Plants; Poaceae; Rosales",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Strain, B.R., Bazzaz, F.A., (1983), pp. 177-222. , CO2 and Plants: The Response of Plants to Rising Levels of Carbon Dioxide (ed.
