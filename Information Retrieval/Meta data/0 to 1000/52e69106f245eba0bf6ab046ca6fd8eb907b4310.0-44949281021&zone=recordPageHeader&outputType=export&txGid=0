However, this figure cannot be verified until British Coal releases relevant data. Recently, the US Environmental Protection Agency has endorsed the use of an emission equation as a means of calculating methane emissions from coal mining. Methane emissions from coal mining rise to 1.19 - 2.21 Mt when this equation is applied to the UK. Both these estimates represent a lost resource and a major global warming effect due to methane's potency as a greenhouse gas. © 1991.","Carbon dioxide equivalent coefficients; Coal-bed methane; Natural gas leakage",,,,,,,"Methane Emissions and Opportunities for Control (1990) Workshop Results of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; (1990) Papers given at International Workshop on Methane Emissions, , See, Washington DC, USA; Mitchell, Sweet, (1990) A Study of Leakage from the UK Natural Gas Supply System with Reference to Global Warming, , Earth Resources Research, Greenpeace, UK, obtainable from; United States Environmental Protection Agency, Methane Emissions from Coal Mining: Issues and Opportunities for Reduction (1990) EPA/400/9-90/008, , Washington DC, USA; Creedy, ‘Estimation of methane emissions in the United Kingdom’, ‘Uses for coal bed methane in electrical power production’ (1990) paper given at International Workshop on Methane Emissions, , Washington DC, USA; P.
