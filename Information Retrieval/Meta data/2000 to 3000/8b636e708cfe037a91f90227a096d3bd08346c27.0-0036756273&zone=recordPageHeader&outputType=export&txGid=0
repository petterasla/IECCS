It has become increasingly necessary to look at alternatives to SF6 for the following reasons: (i) high cost, (ii) sensitivity to particle contamination, (iii) concerns regarding global wanning and hence the possibility of imposed rules for decreased SF6 production. From a practical standpoint, the complete elimination of SF6 as an arc-extinguishing medium is improbable. On the other hand, a reduction in the amount of SF6 and the inclusion of a buffer gas is worthy of consideration. In order to determine the suitability of a buffer gas, it is necessary to understand the buffer gases' fundamental plasma properties. A comparative prediction of the thermal breakdown strengths of the following gases: SF6, N2, O2, air, CO2, H2, He and N2-PTFE after current-zero is presented. The thermophysical properties of a N2-PTFE mixture are also calculated. A one-dimensional wall-stabilised arc model is solved numerically to determine the thermal breakdown strength of the aforementioned buffer gases in the presence of a uniform electric field intensity having a certain rate of rise. Calculations are done for two typical arc radii: 2.5 and 1.5 mm. Predictions confirm the suitability of He, CO2, N2 and air as a buffer gas to SF6 and helium is found to be the best buffer choice.",,"Electric breakdown; Electric circuit breakers; Electric field effects; Electric switchgear; Gases; Quenching; Gas circuit breakers (GCB); Circuit breaking arcs",,,,,,"Shugg, W.T., (1995) 'Handbook of Electrical and Electronic Insulating Materials', 2nd edn., pp. 433-452. , IEEE Press, New York; Paul, K.C., Sakuta, T., Takashima, T., Transport and thermodynamic properties of SF6 gas contaminated by PTFE reinforced with Al2O3 and BN particles (1997) IEEE Trans.
