The potential for wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuel energy as a source of electricity is outlined including the related opportunities for cost effective curtailment of future growth in emissions of CO2. © Higher Education Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","Carbon capture; Climate change; CO2; Ethanol; Radiative forcing; Wind",,,,,,,"Solomon, S., Qin, D., Manning, M., Chen, Z., Marquis, M., Averyt, K.B., Tignor, M., Miller, H.L., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , IPCC., Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change., Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press; McElroy, M.B., (2002) The Atmospheric Environment: Effects of Human Activity, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Qiu, J., Cloudy, with a chance of science (2009) Nature, 461, pp. 466-468; Metz, B., Davidson, O., Coninck, H.D., Loos, M., Meyer, L., (2005) New York: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 51-363. , IPCC.
