This study addresses this topic by investigating the technical and economic feasibility of replacing diesel power generation with hybrid wind power systems in remote communities. For this purpose, the economic, technical and environmental characteristics of eight different hybrid wind power systems were established and compared in respect to their performance in the isolated community of French Island (Victoria, Australia). The results obtained in this study demonstrated the economic and environmental superiority of the hybrid wind-diesel-battery system over all other systems studied in this project. This system was found to have the lowest net present cost and cost per kWh among the modelled systems. Furthermore, the results clearly indicated that hybrid wind power systems are, in general, a feasible and preferable alternative to diesel power generation on the French Island. The research methodology and procedure that were developed in this project can be used to investigate and identify the most viable hybrid power system for other remote communities based on their specific environmental, social and economic circumstances. © 2010.","Economic feasibility; Hybrid power systems; Renewable energy","Battery systems; Carbon emissions; Economic circumstances; Economic feasibilities; Environmental characteristic; Feasibility studies; Global financial crisis; Hybrid power systems; Hybrid wind; Isolated community; Net present cost; Remote communities; Renewable energy; Research methodologies; Victoria , Australia; Global warming; Wind power; Economic analysis; alternative energy; carbon emission; climate change; financial crisis; global warming; power generation; renewable resource; wind power; Australia; Victoria [Australia]",,,,,,"Boulton, B., (2009) Personal Communication, , French Island Community Association, May 7, 2009; Drouilhet, S., (2008) Planning and Preliminary Design of Successful Wind-Diesel Hybrid Power Projects, , Sustainable Automation Inc., Colorado; (2009), http://www.frenchislandinfo.com, FICA (French Island Community Association), French Island.
