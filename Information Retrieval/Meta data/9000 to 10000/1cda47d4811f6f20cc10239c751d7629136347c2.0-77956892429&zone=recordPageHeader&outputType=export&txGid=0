Here, we document changes in the elevational distributions of the small mammals within the Ruby Mountains in northeastern Nevada over an 80-year interval. We quantified range shifts by comparing distributional records from recent comprehensive field surveys (2006-2008) to earlier surveys (1927-1929) conducted at identical and nearby locations. Collector field notes from the historical surveys provided detailed trapping records and locality information, and museum specimens enabled confirmation of species' identifications. To ensure that observed shifts in range did not result from sampling bias, we employed a binomial likelihood model (introduced here) using likelihood ratios to calculate confidence intervals around observed range limits. Climate data indicate increases in both precipitation and summer maximum temperature between sampling periods. Increases in winter minimum temperatures were only evident at mid to high elevations. Consistent with predictions of change associated with climate warming, we document upslope range shifts for only two mesic-adapted species. In contrast, no xeric-adapted species expanded their ranges upslope. Rather, they showed either static distributions over time or downslope contraction or expansion. We attribute these unexpected findings to widespread land-use driven habitat change at lower elevations. Failure to account for land-use induced changes in both baseline assessments and in predicting shifts in species distributions may provide misleading objectives for conservation policies and management practices. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Binomial model; Climate change; Elevational gradient; Great Basin; Likelihood ratios; Nevada; Range limits; Range shifts; Ruby Mountains; Small mammals","climate change; conservation planning; global warming; habitat structure; land use change; management practice; precipitation (climatology); range expansion; small mammal; summer; winter; Great Basin; Nevada; Ruby Mountains; United States; Mammalia",,,,,,"Austin, D.D., Urness, P.J., Vegetal change on a northern Utah foothill range in the absence of livestock grazing between 1948 and 1982 (1998) Great Basin Naturalist, 58, pp. 188-191; Beever, E.A., Brussard, P.E., Berger, J., Patterns of apparent extirpation among isolated populations of pikas (Ochotona princeps) in the Great Basin (2003) Journal of Mammalogy, 84, pp. 37-54; Beneski, J.T., Stinson, D.W., Sorex palustris (1987) Mammalian Species, 296, pp. 1-6; Billings, W.D., Temperature inversions in the pinyon-juniper zone of a Nevada mountain range (1954) Butler University Botanical Studies, 11, pp. 112-117; Borell, A.E., Ellis, R., Mammals of the Ruby Mountains region of north-eastern Nevada (1934) Journal of Mammalogy, 15, pp. 12-44; Bradley, B.A., Fleishman, E., Relationships between expanding pinyon-juniper cover and topography in the central Great Basin, Nevada (2008) Journal of Biogeography, 35, pp. 951-964; Brown, J.H., Mammals on mountaintops: nonequilibrium insular biogeography (1971) American Naturalist, 105, pp. 467-478; Brown, J.H., Valone, T.J., Curtin, C.G., Reorganization of an arid ecosystem in response to recent climate change (1997) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 94, pp. 9729-9733; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , 2nd edn, Springer, New York; Carroll, L.E., Genoways, H.H., Lagurus curtatus (1980) Mammalian Species, 124, pp. 1-6; Cranford, J.A., Hibernation in the western jumping mouse (Zapus princeps) (1978) Journal of Mammalogy, 59, pp. 496-509; Cranford, J.A., Ecological strategies of a small hibernator, the western jumping mouse, Zapus princeps (1983) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 61, pp. 232-240; Crimmins, T.M., Crimmins, M.A., Bertelsen, C.D., Flowering range changes across an elevation gradient in response to warming summer temperatures (2009) Global Change Biology, 15, pp. 1141-1152; Daly, C., Gibson, W.P., Taylor, G.H., Johnson, G.L., Pateris, P., A knowledge-based approach to the statistical mapping of climate (2002) Climate Research, 22, pp. 99-113; Daly, C., Neilson, R.P., Phillips, D.L., A statistical topographic model for mapping climatological precipitation over mountainous terrain (1994) Journal of Applied Meteorology, 33, pp. 140-158; Diaz, H.F., Bradley, R.S., Temperature variations during the last century at high elevation sites (1997) Climatic Change, 36, pp. 253-279; Edwards, A.W.F., (1992) Likelihood: Expanded Edition, , The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore; Elmore, W., Kauffman, B., Riparian and watershed systems: degradation and restoration (1994) Ecological Implications of Livestock Herbivory in the West, pp. 212-231. , Vavra M, Laycock WA, Pieper RD.
