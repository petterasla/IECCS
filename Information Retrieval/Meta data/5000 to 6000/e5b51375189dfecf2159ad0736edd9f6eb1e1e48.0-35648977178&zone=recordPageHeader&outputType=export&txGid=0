This could reduce the effects of global warming, one of which is the current outbreak of epidemic proportions of the mountain pine beetle (MPB) in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The result of this is increasing volumes of dead lodgepole pine with increasingly limited commercial uses. Bioconversion of lodgepole pine to ethanol using SO2-catalyzed steam explosion was investigated. The optimum pretreatment condition for this feedstock was determined to be 200°C, 5 min, and 4% SO2 (w/w). Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of this material provided an overall ethanol yield of 77% of the theoretical yield from raw material based on starting glucan, mannan, and galactan, which corresponds to 244 g ethanol/kg raw material within 30 h. Three conditions representing low (L), medium (M), and high (H) severity were also applied to healthy lodgepole pine. Although the M severity conditions of 200°C, 5 min, and 4% SO2 were sufficiently robust to pretreat healthy wood, the substrate produced from beetle-killed (BK) wood provided consistently higher ethanol yields after SSF than the other substrates tested. BK lodgepole pine appears to be an excellent candidate for efficient and productive bioconversion to ethanol. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Bioconversion; Ethanol; Lignocellulose; Lodgepole pine; Mountain pine beetle (MPB); Separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF); Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF); SO2-catalyzed steam explosion; Softwood","Bioconversion; Biomass; Enzyme activity; Fermentation; Gasoline; Global warming; Hydrolysis; Lignocellulose; Mountain pine beetle (MPB); Separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF); Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF); Ethanol; alcohol; galactan; glucan; mannan; article; biomass; biotransformation; catalysis; controlled study; fermentation; hydrolysis; nonhuman; pine; saccharification; temperature sensitivity; water vapor; Cellulase; Ethanol; Fermentation; Hydrolysis; Pinus; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Steam; Sulfuric Acids; Coleoptera; Pinus contorta; Pinus mugo",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; galactan, 39300-87-3, 9037-55-2; glucan, 9012-72-0, 9037-91-6; mannan, 51395-96-1, 9036-88-8; Cellulase, EC 3.2.1.4; Ethanol, 64-17-5; sulfuric acid, 7664-93-9; Sulfuric Acids",,,,"(2003) Timber supply and the mountain, , BC Ministry of Forests, pine beetle infestation in British Columbia; Interior Appraisal Manual (2004) Victoria, British Columbia: Government of BC, Revenue Branch, , BC Ministry of Forests, 158 p; (2005) British Columbia's Mountain Pine Beetle Action Plan, pp. 2005-2010http. , www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfp/mountain_pine_beetle/ actionplan/2005, BC Ministry of Forests; Bollok, M., Reczey, K., Zacchi, G., Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of steam-pretreated spruce to ethanol (2000) Appl Biochem Biotechnol, 84-86, pp. 69-80; Boussaid, A., Robinson, J., Cai, Y.J., Gregg, D.J., Saddler, J.R., Fermentability of the hemicellulose-derived sugars from steam-exploded softwood (Douglas fir) (1999) Biotechnol Bioeng, 64, pp. 284-289; Boussaid, A.L., Esteghlalian, A.R., Gregg, D.J., Lee, K.H., Saddler, J.N., Steam pretreatment of Douglas-fir wood chips - Can conditions for optimum hemicellulose recovery still provide adequate access for efficient enzymatic hydrolysis?
