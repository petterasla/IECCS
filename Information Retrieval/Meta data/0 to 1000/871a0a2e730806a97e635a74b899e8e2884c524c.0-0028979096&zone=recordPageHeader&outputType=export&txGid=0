Frequently, however, the consequences of alternative policies cannot be accurately predicted because of substantial 'outcome uncertainties' concerning physical, chemical, biological, and social processes linking policy choices to consequences. Similarly, assessments of social preferences among alternative outcomes are limited by 'value uncertainties' arising from limitations of moral principles, the absence of economic markets for many environmental attributes, and other factors. Outcome and value uncertainties relevant to global-change policy are described and their magnitudes are examined for two cases: stratospheric-ozone depletion and global climate change. Analysis of information available in the mid 1980s, when international ozone regulations were adopted, suggests that contemporary uncertainties surrounding CFC emissions and the atmospheric response were so large that plausible ozone depletion, absent regulation, ranged from negligible to catastrophic, a range that exceeded the plausible effect of the regulations considered. Analysis of climate change suggests that, important as outcome uncertainties are, uncertainties about values may be even more important for policy choice. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"environmental policy; global change policy; outcome uncertainty; uncertainty; value uncertainty",,,,,,"Arrow, K.J., (1963) Social Choice and Individual Values, , John Wiley and Sons, New York; Arrow, K.J., Fisher, A.C., Environmental Preservation, Uncertainty, and Irreversibility (1974) Quart.
