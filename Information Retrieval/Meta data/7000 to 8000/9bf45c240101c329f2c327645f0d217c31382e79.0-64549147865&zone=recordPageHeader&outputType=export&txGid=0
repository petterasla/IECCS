In this study, we derived new characterization factors for 63 GHGs that quantify the impact of an emission change on human and ecosystem health damage. For human health damage, the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per unit emission related to malaria, diarrhea, malnutrition, drowning, and cardiovascular diseases were quantified. For ecosystem health damage, the Potentially Disappeared Fraction (PDF) over space and time of various species groups, including plants, butterflies, birds, and mammals, per unit emission was calculated. The influence of value choices in the modeling procedure was analyzed by defining three coherent scenarios, based on Cultural theory perspectives. It was found that the characterization factor for human health damage by carbon dioxide (CO 2) ranges from 1.1 × 10 -2 to 1.8 × 10 +1 DALY per kton of emission, while the characterization factor for ecosystem damage by CO 2 ranges from 5.4 × 10 -2 to 1.2 × 10 +1 disappeared fraction of species over space and time ((km 2-year)/kton), depending on the scenario chosen. The characterization factor of a GHG can change up to 4 orders of magnitude, depending on the scenario. The scenario-specific differences are mainly explained by the choice for a specific time horizon and stresses the importance of dealing with value choices in the life cycle impact assessment of GHG emissions. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Cardio-vascular disease; Cultural theories; Disability adjusted life years; Ecosystem healths; Emission changes; Ghg emissions; Green house gas emissions; Human healths; Life cycle impact assessments; Life-cycle assessments; Modeling procedures; Orders of magnitudes; Ozone depletions; Per units; Space and time; Specific time; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Damage detection; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Health; Health risks; Leakage (fluid); Mammals; Ozone; Ozone layer; Sulfur compounds; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; acidification; carbon dioxide; cardiovascular disease; damage; environmental impact assessment; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; air pollution control; article; bird; butterfly; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; diarrhea; drowning; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; malaria; malnutrition; mammal; plant; pollution monitoring; Communicable Diseases; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Time Factors; World Health; Aves; Mammalia; Papilionoidea",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Thomas, C.D., Cameron, A., Green, R.E., Bakkenes, M., Beaumont, L.J., Collingham, Y.C., Erasmus, B.F.N., Grainger, A., Extinction risk from climate change (2004) Nature, 427 (6970), pp. 145-147; McMichael, A.J., Campbell-Lendrum, D.H., Corvalan, C.F., Ebi, K.L., Githeko, A., Scheraga, J.D., Woodward, A., (2003) Climate Change and Human Health.
