The area of planted pine has increased more than 10-fold since 1950, mostly on private lands. Private landowners have responded to market incentives and government programs, including subsidized afforestation on marginal agricultural land. Timber harvest is a crucial disturbance affecting planted pine area, as other forest types are converted to planted pine after harvest. Conversely, however, many harvested pine plantations revert to other forest types, mainly due to passive regeneration behavior on nonindustrial private timberlands. We model land use and land cover changes as a basis for projecting future changes in planted pine area, to aid policy analysts concerned with mitigation activities for global climate change. Projections are prepared in two stages. Projected land use changes include deforestation due to pressures to develop rural land as the human population expands, which is a larger area than that converted from other rural lands (e.g., agriculture) to forestry. In the second stage, transitions among forest types are projected on land allocated to forestry. We consider reforestation, influences of timber harvest, and natural succession and disturbance processes. Baseline projections indicate a net increase of about 5.6 million ha in planted pine area in the South over the next 50 years, with a notable increase in sequestered carbon. Additional opportunities to expand pine plantation area warrant study of landowner behavior to aid in designing more effective incentives for inducing land use and land cover changes to help mitigate climate change and attain other goals.","Baseline; Carbon sequestration; Forest cover type; Mitigation","Carbon; Forestry; Land use; Marketing; Reforestation; Afforestation; Carbon analyses; Plantations; Environmental engineering; carbon; carbon sequestration; forest management; forestry; land cover; land use change; timber harvesting; agriculture; carbon sequestration; climate change; conference paper; deforestation; forest; geographic distribution; global climate; human; land use; nonhuman; pine; policy; United States; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forecasting; Forestry; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Trees; United States; North America; United States",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Adams, D., Haynes, R., (1996) The 1993 Timber Assessment Market Model: Structure Projections, and Policy Simulations, , General Technical Report, GTR-PNW-504.
