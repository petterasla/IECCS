The aerodynamic characteristics investigated include the ship hull at the fully-loaded draught, the sail-sail interaction effects for two sets of four identical hybrid-sails, and the sail-hull interaction effects for the same two sets of identical sails in the presence of the selected bulk carrier hull-form. This is in addition to lift-drag measurements of single isolated sails of each shape. The form of the two sets of soft sails was rectangular and triangular. This paper is concerned with assessing the benefits of a sail-assisted ship operation, and hence a steady-state rather than complete time-domain integrations of the governing equations are reported. The results of the completed analysis suggest that the benefits of the derived sail generated driving force are greater than the overhead of equipping the ship with a selected system of hybrid-sails. Sail-assisted ships could represent an important contribution to an improving global environment by reducing the demands for a driving force through the propeller. © JASNAOE 2005.","Economic benefit; Global warming control; Sail-assisted ship; Sail-sail and sail-hull form interaction; Steady-sailing performance","Aerodynamics; Cost benefit analysis; Global warming; Hulls (ship); Hydrodynamics; Sailing vessels; Ship model tanks; Ship propellers; Wind tunnels; Economic benefits; Global warming control; Sail-assisted ships; Sail-sail and sail-hull form interaction; Steady-sailing performance; Ships",,,,,,"Kijima, K., Katsuno, T., Nakiri, Y., On the manoeuvring performance of a ship with the parameter of loading condition (1990) J Soc Nav Archit Jpn, 168, pp. 141-148; Fujii, H., Tsuda, T., Experimental research on rudder performance (1961) J Soc Nav Archit Jpn, 110, p. 31. , 2 in Japanese; Yoshimura, Y., Tanabe, Y., Ohsugi, I., On the prediction of the sailing performance for a large sail training ship (1990) J Jpn Inst Navig, 84, pp. 19-27. , in Japanese; Fujiwara, T., Hirata, K., Ueno, M., On aerodynamic characteristics of a hybrid-sail with square soft sail (2003) Proceedings of the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineering, ISOPE2003, pp. 326-333. , Hawaii, pp; Fujiwara, T., Hirata, K., Ueno, M., On development of high performance sails for an oceangoing sailing ship (2003) Proceedings of the International Conference on Marine Simulation and Ship Manoeuvrability, MARSIM'03, pp. RC-23-1-9. , Kanazawa; Ishihara, M., Watanabe, T., Shimizu, K., Prospect of sail-equipped motorship as assessed from experimental ship ""Daioh"" (1980) Proceedings of the Shipboard Energy Conservation Symposium, pp. 181-198. , Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers; Matsumoto, N., Inoue, M., Sudo, M., Operating performance of a sail equipped tanker in wave and wind (1982) 2nd International Conference on Stability of Ships and Ocean Vehicles, STAB '82, pp. 451-464. , Tokyo; Minami, Y., Nimura, T., Fujiwara, T., Investigation into underwater fin arrangement effect on steady sailing characteristics of a sail assisted ship (2003) In: Proceedings of the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineering, ISOPE2003, pp. 318-325. , Hawaii; Minami, Y., Nimura, T., Fujiwara, T., Investigation into underwater fin arrangement effect on steady sailing characteristics of a sail assisted ship (2003) Proceedings of the International Conference on Marine Simulation and Ship Manoeuvrability, MARSIM'03, pp. RB-8-1-8. , Kanazawa; Fujiwara, T., Kitamura, F., Ueno, M., Hybrid-sail-hull and sail-sail interaction effects for an ocean-going sailing ship (2004) Proceedings of the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineering, ISOPE2004, pp. 351-358. , Toulon; Fujiwara, T., Hearn, G.E., Kitamura, F., Sail-sail and sail-hull interaction effects of hybrid-sail assisted bulk carrier (2005) J Mar Sci Technol, 10, pp. 82-95; Hirano, M., Takashina, J., A calculation of ship turning motion taking coupling effect due to heel into consideration (1980) J West Jpn Soc Nav Archit, p. 59; (1983) Kansai Shipbuilding Design Handbook, p. 465. , Kansai Society of Naval Architects, Japan; Kijima, K., Nakiri, Y., Approximate expression for hydrodynamic derivatives of ship manoeuvring motion taking into account the effect of stern shape (1999) J West Jpn Soc Nav Archit, 98, pp. 67-77; Watanabe, I., Tomita, H., Tanizawa, K., Statistical diagrams on the wind and waves on ihe north Pacific Ocean (1974-1988) (1992) Report of NMRI, 14. , http://www.nmri.go.jp/wavedb/wavedb.hlml, in Japanese; Woud, H.K., Stapersma, D., Design of propulsion and electric power generation systems (2002) IMarEST, p. 478","Fujiwara, T.; National Maritime Research Institute (NMRI), 6-38-1 Shinkawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0004, Japan; email: fujiwara@nmri.go.jp",,,,,,,,09484280,,,,"English","J.
