Their biomass peaked in summer 2000 and then declined precipitously, stabilizing at a moderate level after 2001. The onsets of the outburst and decline coincided with transitions between climatic regimes. Specifically, 1989 marked the beginning of a period of moderate temperatures in the eastern Bering Sea, after the warm conditions of the late 1970s through the 1980s. Very warm conditions came to the eastern Bering after 2000, as evidenced by decreased ice cover in winter and increased total heat content and surface water temperatures in summer. We examined the relationships between jellyfish biomass and temperature, ice cover, atmospheric variables, current patterns, zooplankton biomass, and associated fish biomass in two regions of the Middle Shelf Domain (SE and NW) by use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM). We found density-dependent interactions within and between jellyfish biomass in the two regions related to the flow regime, and demonstrated a linkage between biophysical indices and jellyfish biomass. In particular, ice cover (SE and NW), sea-surface temperature in spring (SE) and summer (NW), and wind mixing (SE) all influenced jellyfish biomass. In addition, the importance of juvenile pollock biomass (SE) and zooplankton biomass (NW) suggest that jellyfish biomass was sensitive to the availability of prey. Since most climate models suggest continued warming is likely in the Bering Sea, the jellyfish populations may remain at moderate levels there but will likely shift northward into the Arctic Ocean. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Biophysical conditions; Climate change; Ecosystems; Global warming; Ice; North Pacific Ocean; Scyphomedusae; Walleye pollock; Zooplankton","Ecosystems; Global warming; Oceanography; Population dynamics; Biophysical conditions; Scyphomedusae; Walleye pollock; Zooplankton; Fish; biomass; climate change; density dependence; ecological modeling; ice cover; jellyfish; prey availability; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Chrysaora melanaster; Pollachius; Scyphomedusae; Scyphozoa; Theragra chalcogramma",,,,,,"Arai, M.N., Pelagic coelenterates and eutrophication: a review (2001) Hydrobiologia, 451, pp. 69-87; Attrill, M.J., Wright, J., Edwards, M., Climate-related increases in jellyfish frequency suggest a more gelatinous future for the North Sea (2007) Limnology and Oceanography, 52, pp. 480-485; Baier, C.T., Napp, J.M., Climate-induced variability in Calanus marshallae populations (2003) Journal of Plankton Research, 25, pp. 771-782; Behrenfeld, M.J., O'Malley, R.T., Siegel, D.A., McClain, C.R., Sarmiento, J.L., Feldman, G.C., Milligan, A.J., Boss, E.S., Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity (2006) Nature, 444, pp. 752-755; Benson, A.J., Trites, A.W., Ecological effects of regime shifts in the Bering Sea and eastern North Pacific Ocean (2002) Fish and Fisheries, 3, pp. 95-113; Bond, N.A., Overland, J.E., Spillane, M., Stabeno, P., Recent shifts in the state of the North Pacific (2003) Geophysical Research Letters, 30, p. 2183; Brodeur, R.D., In situ observations of the associations of juvenile fishes and schyphomedusae in the eastern Bering Sea (1998) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 163, pp. 11-20; Brodeur, R.D., Mills, C.E., Overland, J.E., Walters, G.E., Schumacher, J.D., Substantial increase in gelatinous zooplankton in the Bering Sea, with possible links to climate change (1999) Fisheries Oceanography, 8, pp. 296-306; Brodeur, R.D., Sugisaki, H., Hunt Jr., G.L., Increases in jellyfish biomass in the Bering Sea: implications for the ecosystem (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 233, pp. 89-103; Ciannelli, L., Chan, K.-S., Bailey, K.M., Stenseth, N.C., Nonadditive effects of the environment on the survival of a large marine fish population (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 3418-3427; Connors, M.E., Hollowed, A.B., Brown, E., Retrospective analysis of Bering Sea bottom trawl surveys: regime shift and ecosystem reorganization (2002) Progress in Oceanography, 55, pp. 209-222; Coyle, K.O., Pinchuk, A.I., Eisner, L.B., Napp, J.M., in press.
