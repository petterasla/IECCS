Foundation, Adelaide, SA, Australia","The global hydrological and salt cycles are described, as are the ways in which human activities have led to their disturbance. One effect of this disturbance is the unnatural increase in the salinity of many inland waters (secondary salinization). The geographical extent of secondary salinization is outlined, together with its effects on various types of inland waters, such as salt lakes, freshwater lakes and wetlands, and rivers and streams. The likely impact on salinization of global climate change is summarized.","Global cycles; Inland waters; Salt; Secondary salinization","Climate change; Hydrology; Seawater; Salinization; Saline water; fresh water; inorganic salt; human activity; hydrological cycle; land degradation; salinization; water pollution; conference paper; ecology; geography; global climate; lake; meteorological phenomena; river; salinity; wetland; Fresh Water; Humans; Natural Disasters; Salts; Water Supply; World Health",,"Salts",,,,"Davies, B.R., Thoms, M.C., Walker, K.F., O'Keefe, J.H., Gore, J.A., Dryland rivers: Their ecology, conservation and management (1994) The Rivers Handbook, 2. , In: P.
