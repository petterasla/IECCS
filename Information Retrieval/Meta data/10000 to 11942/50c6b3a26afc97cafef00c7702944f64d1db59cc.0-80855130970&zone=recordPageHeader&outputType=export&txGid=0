We examine how the concept of a null hypothesis is being used implicitly and explicitly in the scientific and policy debate on climate change, in the context of scientific hypothesis testing, as a framework for 'burden of proof' arguments and policy deliberations, and metaphorically in the context of a polemic. It is argued that the statement of a null hypothesis is not particularly useful in the broader context of the scientific inferences surrounding the topic of the attribution of climate change and also policy decisions. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Trenberth, K.E., Communicating climate science and thoughts on climategate.
