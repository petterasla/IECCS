Climate models are useful tools for predicting how season length might change in the future. However, the accuracy of these models tends to be rather low at regional geographic scales. Here, I determined the ability of several atmosphere and ocean general circulating models (AOGCMs) to accurately simulate historical season lengths for a temperate ectotherm across the continental United States. I also evaluated the effectiveness of regional-scale correction factors to improve the accuracy of these models. I found that both the accuracy of simulated season lengths and the effectiveness of the correction factors to improve the model's accuracy varied geographically and across models. These results suggest that regional specific correction factors do not always adequately remove potential discrepancies between simulated and historically observed environmental parameters. As such, an explicit evaluation of the correction factors' effectiveness should be included in future studies of global climate change's impact on biological populations. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Allonemobius socius; AOGCM; Climate change; Model accuracy; Season length","accuracy assessment; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; correction; cricket; ectothermy; future prospect; growing season; oceanic general circulation model; article; climate change; computer simulation; season; theoretical model; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Models, Theoretical; Seasons; United States; Allonemobius socius",,,,,,"Allen, J.C., Modified sine wave method for calculating degree days (1976) Environmental Entomology, 5, pp. 388-396; Bonhomme, R., Bases and limits to using 'degree.day' units (2000) European Journal of Agronomy, 13 (1), pp. 1-10. , DOI 10.1016/S1161-0301(00)00058-7, PII S1161030100000587; Brown, J.H., Stevens, G.C., Kaufman, D.M., The geographic range: Size, shape, boundaries, and internal structure (1996) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 27, pp. 597-623; Christensen, J.H., Regional climate projections (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , S.
