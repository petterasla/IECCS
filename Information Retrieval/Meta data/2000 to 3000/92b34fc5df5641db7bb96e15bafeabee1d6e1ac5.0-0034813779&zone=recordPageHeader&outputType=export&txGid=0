Salmon remains have been found at 24 sites in Hokkaido from the Early Jomon Period to the Ainu Period (6000-100 years ago). Fish remains at three archeological sites in the Kushiro River basin indicated that Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) were distributed and utilized from 6000 years ago. The present Kushiro Wetland was formerly covered with seawater and called the Paleo Kushiro Bay 5000-6000 years ago. Based on the molluscan fossil fauna, seawater temperature at Paleo Kushiro Bay was about 5°C warmer than at present. Warmer conditions for salmon in Kushiro 5000-6000 years ago corresponded with the poor conditions for salmon in the Columbia River basin 6000-7000 years ago. If the future global warming is similar to the conditions that prevailed 5000-6000 years ago, the southern limit of salmon distribution will shift northwards and the salmon production will decrease. However, they will not disappear from either Hokkaido or southwestern North America. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
