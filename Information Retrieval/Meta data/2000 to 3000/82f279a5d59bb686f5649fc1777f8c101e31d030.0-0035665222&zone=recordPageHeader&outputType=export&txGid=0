The climatic change of doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide may produce dramatic water yield changes across the basin. Estimated changes in basin water yield from doubled CO2 climate were simulated using a Regional Climate Model (RegCM) and a physically based rainfall-runoff model. RegCM output from a five-year, equilibrium climate simulation at twice present CO2 levels was compared to a similar present-day climate run to extract monthly changes in meteorologic variables needed by the hydrologic model. These changes, simulated on a 50-km grid, were matched at a commensurate scale to the 310 subbasins in the rainfall-runoff model climate change impact analysis. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) rainfall-runoff model was used in this study. The climate changes were applied to the 1965 to 1989 historic period. Overall water yield at the mouth of the Basin decreased by 10 to 20 percent during spring and summer months, but increased during fall and winter. Yields generally decreased in the southern portions of the basin but increased in the northern reaches. Northern subbasin yields increased up to 80 percent: equivalent to 1.3 cm of runoff on an annual basis.","Global climate change; Meteorology/climatology; Missouri River Basin; Regional circulation model; Reservoir modeling; Surface water hydrology; Water resources","Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Rain; River basin projects; Runoff; Yields; Climate change; climate change; environmental impact; rainfall-runoff modeling; water budget; United States",,,,,,"Arnold, J.G., Srinivasan, R., Muttiah, R.S., Allen, P.M., Continental scale simulation of the hydrologic balance (1999) Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 35, pp. 1037-1051; Arnold, J.G., Srinivasan, R., Muttiah, R.S., Williams, J.R., Large area hydrologic modeling and assessment - Part 1: Model development (1998) Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 34, pp. 73-89; Arnold, J.G., Williams, J.R., Srinivasan, R., King, K.W., (1995) Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) Users Manual, , USDA-ARS, Temple, Texas; Beven, K., Changing ideas in hydrology - The case of physically-based models (1989) Journal of Hydrology, 105 (1), pp. 157-172; Brown, R.A., Rosenberg, N.J., Easterling, W.E., Hays, C., Mearns, L.O., Potential production and environmental effects of switchgrass and traditional crops under current and gGreenhouse-altered climate in the MINK region of the Central United States (1999) Ecology and Agricultural Environment; Giorgi, F., Mearns, L.O., Shields, C., McDaniel, L., Regional nested model simulations of present day and 2xCO2 climate over the central plains of the United States (1998) Climatic Change, 40, pp. 457-493; Hotchkiss, R.H., Jorgensen, S.F., Stone, M.C., Fontaine, T.A., Regulated river modeling for climate change impact assessment: The Missouri River (2000) Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 36 (2), pp. 375-386; Hubbard Carter, M., (1998) Hydrologic Modeling of the Missouri River Basin in a Climate Change Model, , M.S.
