These may in turn provide feedbacks on climate through a modification of surface-atmosphere fluxes of energy and moisture. This paper uses asynchronously coupled models of global vegetation and climate to examine the responses of potential vegetation to different aspects of a doubled-CO2 environmental change, and compares the feedbacks on near-surface temperature arising from physiological and structural components of the vegetation response. Stomatal conductance reduces in response to the higher CO2 concentration, but rising temperatures and a redistribution of precipitation also exert significant impacts on this property as well as leading to major changes in potential vegetation structure. Overall, physiological responses act to enhance the warming near the surface, but in many areas this is offset by increases in leaf area resulting from greater precipitation and higher temperatures. Interactions with seasonal snow cover result in a positive feedback on winter warming in the boreal forest regions.","Climate change; Doubled-CO2; Earth system modelling; General circulation model; Global warming; Plant physiology; Potential vegetation; Vegetation feedbacks; Vegetation model; Vegetation structure","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; global warming; vegetation structure",,,,,,"Beljaars, A.C.M., Viterbo, P., Miller, M.J., Betts, A.K., The anomolous rainfall over the United States during July 1993: Sensitivity to land surface parameterization and soil moisture anomalies (1996) Monthly Weather Review, 124, pp. 362-383; Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Lee, S.E., Woodward, F.I., Contrasting physiological and structural vegetation feedbacks in climate change simulations (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 796-799; Bonan, G.B., Pollard, D., Thompson, S.L., Effects of boreal forest vegetation on global climate (1992) Nature, 359, pp. 716-718; Chen, T.H., Henderson-Sellers, A., Milly, P.C.D., Pitman, A.J., Beljaars, A.C.M., Polcher, J., Abramapoulos, F., Zeng, Q., Cabauw experimental results from the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameterization Schemes (PILPS) (1997) Journal of Climate, 10, pp. 1194-1215; Cox, P.M., Betts, R.A., Bunton, C.B., Essery, R.L.H., Rowntree, P.R., Smith, J., The impact of new land surface physics on the GCM simulation of climate and climate sensitivity (1999) Climate Dynamics, 15, pp. 183-203; Dolman, A.J., Gregory, D., The parametrization of rainfall interception in GCMs (1992) Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 118, pp. 455-469; Foley, J.A., Kutzbach, J.E., Coe, M.T., Levis, S., Feedbacks between climate and boreal forests during the Holocene epoch (1994) Nature, 371, pp. 52-54; Foley, J.A., Levis, S., Prentice, I.C., Pollard, D., Thompson, S.L., Coupling dynamic models of climate and vegetation (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 561-579; Gallimore, R.G., Kutzbach, J.E., Role of orbitally induced changes in tundra area in the onset of glaciation (1996) Nature, 381, pp. 503-505; Johns, T.C., Carnell, R.E., Crossley, H., Gregory, J.M., Mitchell, J.F.B., Senior, C.A., Tett, S.F.B., Wood, R.A., The second Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM: Model description, spinup and validation (1997) Climate Dynamics, 13, pp. 103-134; Jones, C., Betts, R., Cox, P., A coupled climate carbon cycle project (1999) Research Activities in Atmospheric and Oceanic Modelling.
