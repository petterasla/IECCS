The presence of extensive soil carbon reserves in the Arctic suggests that substantial feedbacks to CO2-induced climate change could occur if warming alters carbon cycling belowground. Characterization of the controls on regional patterns of belowground CO2 release through the annual cycle is an important step towards evaluating potential feedbacks from arctic ecosystems to climate change. In this study, we assess seasonal control over the influences by climate and vegetation-type on CO2 efflux from belowground in the Alaskan tundra. Our results indicate that climate had strong effects on belowground CO2 release in both seasons. By contrast, vegetation-type had little impact on CO2 efflux from belowground in whiter but was the principal control in summer. Together, these results demonstrate that seasonality is a critical factor regulating climate and vegetation-type effects on belowground CO2 release, which should be included in regional models of net carbon balance in arctic ecosystems.","Arctic; Carbon dioxide; Climate; Soda lime; Soil respiration; Vegetation",,,,,,,"Billings, W.D., Petersen, K.M., Shaver, G.R., Trent, A.W., Root growth, respiration and carbon dioxide evolution in an arctic tundra soil (1977) Arctic Alpine Res, 9 (2), pp. 129-137; Bliss, L.C., Matveyeva, N.V., Circumpolar arctic vegetation (1992) Arctic Ecosystems in a Changing Climate, pp. 11-34. , Chapin III FS, Jefferies RL, Reynolds JL, Shaver GR, Svoboda J, editors San Diego: Academic Press; Boike, J., Thermal, hydrological and geochemical dynamics of the active layer at a continuous permafrost site, Taymyr Peninsula, Siberia (1997) Berichte Zur Polarforschung, 242, pp. 1-104; Brubaker, L.B., Anderson, P.M., Hu, F.S., Arctic tundra biodiversity: A temporal perspective from late quaternary pollen records (1995) Arctic and Alpine Biodiversity: Patterns, Causes and Ecosystem Consequences, pp. 111-126. , Chapin III FS, Körner C, editors Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Chapin F.S.
