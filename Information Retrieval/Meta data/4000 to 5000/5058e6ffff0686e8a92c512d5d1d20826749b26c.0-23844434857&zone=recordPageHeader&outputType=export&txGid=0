Even though the majority of short-term climate policies propose trading between gases on a global warming potential (GWP) basis, discussions of whether CO 2 concentrations should be 450, 550, 650 or perhaps as much as 750 ppm leave unstated whether there should be no additional forcing from other GHGs beyond current levels or whether separate concentration targets should be established for each GHG. Here, we use an integrated modeling framework to examine multi-gas stabilization in terms of temperature, economic costs, carbon uptake and other important consequences. We show that there are significant differences in both costs and climate impacts between different ""GWP equivalent"" policies and demonstrate the importance of non-CO 2 GHG reduction on timescales of up to several centuries. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
