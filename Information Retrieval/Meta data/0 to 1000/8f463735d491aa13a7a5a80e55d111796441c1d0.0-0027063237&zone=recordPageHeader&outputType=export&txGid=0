Box 300, N-4001 Stanvanger, Norway; Judd, A.G., School of Environment, University of Sunderland, United Kingdom","Since methane, per mole, has a global warming potential 3.7 times that of carbon dioxide (Lashof and Ahuja, 1990, Nature, 344, 529-531) it is one the most important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is therefore crucial to acquire a basic understanding of the natural global methane emission variability and inventory. Methane contained and seeping from shallow marine sediments represents a vast, but largely uncharted source of ocean and atmospheric methane. A rough global estimates is made here on the amount of methane annually venting through the seabed from shallow marine sediments in water depths less than 250 m. The globally extrapolated estimate is based on observations of methane point sources in the North Sea. These estimates show that marine sediments probably represent an important but variable source of methane to the atmosphere. However, much more survey work and detailed measurements are needed before a more exact figure on total source strength and variability can be provided. © 1992.",,"gas; geophysical mapping; global production; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; sea; seabed; seep: gas; seepage; water column; North Sea",,,,,,"Addy, Worzel, Gas seeps and sub-structure off Panama City, Florida (1979) American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 636, pp. 668-675; Anonymous, Kattegat “koraller” påhavbunnen (1988) Report of the Danish Ministry for Forest and Nature Conservations, p. 32; Barker, Calculated volume and pressure changes during the thermal cracking of oil to gas in reservoirs (1990) American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 74, pp. 1254-1261; Brooks, Sackett, Sources, sinks and concentration of light hydrocarbons in the Gulf of Mexico (1973) Journal of Geophysical Research, 78, pp. 5248-5258; Bryant, Roemer, Structure of the continental shelf and slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico and its geohazards and engineering constraints (1983) CRC handbook of geophysical exploration at sea, pp. 123-184. , R.A.
