The 1997/1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was the most severe on record and affected coral reefs worldwide. The present study examined the response of fish assemblages in plots of transplanted coral before and after the 1998 bleaching. Multidimensional scaling ordinations (MDS) demonstrate significant changes in assemblage composition related to habitat alteration. Within-site variability increased with disturbance, the increase being most apparent following substrate erosion. The differences in long-term responses as opposed to short-term responses were striking. Six mo after coral death, total abundance as well as taxonomic richness had increased at one of the sites, but not the other, whereas 6 yr later, both measures had decreased significantly at both sites. Functional groups, with documented affiliations with coral, were significantly influenced by the habitat alteration. Herbivore abundance increased as an immediate response to bleaching, but was subsequently decimated in eroded habitat. The loss of structural complexity had major detrimental effects on the entire fish community. In conclusion, we present evidence of severe and long-lasting secondary impacts of a catastrophic bleaching event, with no apparent recovery. The discrepancies between short-term and long-term responses underline the importance of long-term monitoring of fish assemblages following habitat alteration. © Inter-Research 2006.","Community ecology; Coral degradation; Corallivores; Disturbance; Global warming; Habitat structure; Herbivores; Multivariate analyses","coral bleaching; coral reef; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental degradation; environmental disturbance; fish; transplantation; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Adjeroud, M., Augustin, D., Galzin, R., Salvat, B., Natural disturbances and interannual variability of coral reef communities on the outer slope of Tiahura (Moorea, French Polynesia): 1991 to 1997 (2002) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 237, pp. 121-131; Allen, G.R., (1991) Damselfishes of the World, , Mergus Publishers, Melle; Almany, G.R., Does increased habitat complexity reduce predation and competition in coral reef fish assemblages?
