The variations in the dirty ratio displayed a decrease trend over the past 200 years, which implies that dust events became less frequent during the study period. The decrease trend in the variations in dust event frequency might be caused mostly by the natural processes, including increasing precipitation and weakening westerly which might be related with global wanning. Furthermore, significant negative correlation was found between the dirty ratio and δ18O in the Malan ice core. This is highly important for studying the effect of atmospheric dust on climate change.","Climate change; Dust event; Malan ice core; Tibetan plateau",,,,,,,"Prospero, J.M., Long-range transport of mineral dust in the global atmosphere: Impact of African dust on the environment of the southeastern United States (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 96 (7), pp. 3396-3403;
