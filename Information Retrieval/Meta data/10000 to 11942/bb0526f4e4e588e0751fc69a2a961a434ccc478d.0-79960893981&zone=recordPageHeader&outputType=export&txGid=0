Although a number of studies have been dedicated to understand the phenomenon of climate change, more attention is required to understand the potential effects of global warming on the ecosystems as well as on human life. The present study was designed to survey the trends of minimum, maximum and mean temperatures, relative humidity, and the time series of annual precipitation and 10-year moving average low-pass filter in the 13 synoptic weather stations of Iran's arid and semi-arid regions during the last 55 years by using τ Kendall test. The analyses indicate a significantly increasing trend for the minimum and mean temperatures while a decreasing trend for the mean relative humidity in the arid and semi-arid regions, especially during the last few years up to the year 2000. Any clear increasing or decreasing trend was not found for the maximum temperature, while the precipitation did not show any increasing/decreasing trend for most of the surveyed stations. Further studies, with long-term programming, are recommended to be carried out to evaluate the climate change and its effects on such regions. © 2010 Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Annual; Global warming; Humidity; Precipitation; Temperature","arid region; global warming; relative humidity; semiarid region; temperature effect; time series; weather station; Iran",,,,,,"Abahussain, A.A., Abdu, A.S., Al-Zubari, W.K., El-Deen, N.A., Raheen, M.A., Desertification in the Arab region: analysis of current status and trends (2002) J Arid Environ, 51, pp. 521-545; Brutsaert, W., Parlange, M.B., Hydrologic cycle explains the evaporation paradox (1998) Nature, 30, pp. 396-403; Elagib, N.A., Abdu, S.A., Climate variability and aridity in Bahrain (1997) J Arid Environ, 36, pp. 405-419; Evans, J., Geerken, R., Discrimination between climate and human-induced dryland degradation (2004) J Arid Environ, 57, pp. 535-554; Georgios, A.F., Christodoulides, P., (2008) Global warming and carbon dioxide through sciences, 35, pp. 390-401. , Environment International; Kendall, M.G., Stuart, A., (1973) The Advanced Theory by Statistics, , Griffin, London; Kiely, G., Climate change in Ireland from precipitation and stream flow observations (1999) Adv Water Resour, 23, pp. 141-151; Modarres, R., Silva, V., Rainfall trends in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran (2007) J Arid Environ, 70, pp. 344-355; Ngongondo, C.S., (2006) An analysis of long-term rainfall variability, trends and groundwater availability in the Mulunguzi river catchment area, Zomba mountain, Southern Malawi, 148, pp. 45-50. , Quaternary International; Oliver, H.R., Oliver, S.A., The role of water and the hydrological cycle in global change.
