Fish of lower condition exhibited disproportionately higher mortality during the spawning run, elucidating a critical link between energetic condition and a fish's ability to reach the spawning grounds. We simulated spawning migrations by accounting for energetic demands for an average individual in the population from the time of entry into the Fraser River estuary to arrival on the spawning grounds (about 1,200 km upstream) and estimated energy expenditures for the average migrant during 1950-2001. The model output indicates relatively high interannual variability in migration energy use and a marked increase in energy demands in recent years related to unusually high discharges (e.g., 1997) and warmer than average water temperature (e.g., 1998). We examined how global climate change might effect discharge, water temperature, and the energy used by sockeye salmon during their spawning migration. Expected future reductions in peak flows during freshets markedly reduced transit time to the spawning ground, representing a substantial energy savings that compensated for the effect of the increased metabolic rate resulting from exposure to warmer river temperatures. We suggest that such watershed-scale compensatory mechanisms may be critical to the long-term sustainability of Pacific salmon, given expected changes in climate. However, such compensation will probably only be applicable to some stocks and may be limited under extremely high temperatures where nonenergetic factors such as disease and stress may play a more dominant role in defining mortality. Our results further indicate that a long-term decline in the mean mass of adult sockeye salmon completing their marine residency could erode their migratory fitness during the river migration and hence jeopardize the sustainability of sockeye salmon and the fishery that targets them. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2006.",,"annual variation; bioenergetics; body condition; body mass; climate change; compensation; fishery economics; fishery management; global climate; metabolism; migratory population; mortality; river discharge; salmonid; spawning ground; sustainability; temperature effect; water temperature; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser River; North America; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus nerka",,,,,,"Beamish, R.J., Bouillon, D.R., Pacific salmon trends in relation to climate (1993) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 50, pp. 1002-1016; Beamish, R.J., Neville, C.M., Thomson, B.L., Harrison, P.J., St. John, M., A relationship between Fraser River discharge and interannual production of Pacific Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) in the Strait of Georgia (1994) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 51, pp. 2843-2855; Beamish, R.J., Noakes, D.J., McFarlane, G.A., Klyashtorin, L., Ivanov, V.V., Kurashov, V., The regime concept and natural trends in the production of Pacific salmon (1999) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 56, pp. 516-526; Beauchamp, D.A., Stewart, D.J., Thomas, G.L., Corroboration of a bioenergetics model for sockeye salmon (1989) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 118, pp. 597-607; Bigler, B.S., Welch, D.W., Helle, J.H., A review of size trends among North Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) (1996) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 53, pp. 455-465; Brett, R.J., Energetics (1995) Physiological Ecology of Pacific Salmon, pp. 1-68. , C.
