The result shows that the increase of ground albedo and the change of the surface heat flux as well as the decrease of the surface roughness length may induce the decrease of precipitation and the increase of temperature in the northern China, similar to the numerical simulation. Considering advection, this conclusion is also true except the amounts of the decrease of precipitation and the increase of temperature are changed. The decrease of precipitation and the increase of temperature will be more serious in case of global warming.","Albedo; Climate change; Landuse",,,,,,,"Bosilovich, K.G., Sun, W.Y., Monthly simulation of surface fluxes and soil properties during FIFE (1998) J.
