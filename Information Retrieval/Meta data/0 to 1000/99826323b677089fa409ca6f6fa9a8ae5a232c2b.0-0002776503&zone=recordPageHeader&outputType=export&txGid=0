Recent experiments have shown that consumption of dissolved DMS by microbial metabolism may be more important than atmospheric exchange in controlling its concentration in surface waters and hence its ventilation to the atmosphere. In this paper we investigate the effect of the marine food web on cycling of dissolved DMS in surface waters during a phytoplankton bloom episode. A nitrogen-based flow network simulation model has been used to analyze the relative importance of the various biological and chemical processes involved. The model predictions suggest that the concentration of DMS in marine surface waters is indeed governed by bacterial metabolism. Comparison of the model predictions has been made with tank algal bloom experiments. -from Authors",,"algal bloom; algal blooms; cycling; dimethylsulphide; dimethylsulphide production; global warming; modelling; phytoplankton bloom; tank experiment; trophodynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002776503
