If this is the case, then increases in temperature resulting from global climate change might drastically affect regeneration of arctic species. We examined whether recruitment of Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum and Vaccinium uliginosum (hereafter E. nigrum and V. uliginosum) was affected by temperature during three reproductive stages: seed development, dormancy breakage and germination. Seeds were collected from an arctic, an alpine (only E. nigrum) and a boreal site with different climates; stored at different winter temperatures and incubated for germination at different temperatures. Seeds of V. uliginosum developed in the boreal region had a higher percentage germination than did seeds developed in the Arctic. In contrast, seeds of E. nigrum from the arctic site had a higher or similar percentage germination than did seeds from the alpine and boreal sites. Increased winter temperatures had no significant effect on resulting germination percentage of E. nigrum. However, V. uliginosum seeds from the arctic site suffered increased fungal attack (and thus decreased germination) when they were stratified under high winter temperatures. Seeds of both species increased germination with increased incubation temperatures. Our results suggest that both species would increase their germination in response to warmer summers. Longer summers might also favour the slow-germinating E. nigrum. However, increased winter temperatures might increase mortality due to fungal attack in V. uliginosum ecotypes that are not adapted to mild winters. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Dormancy; Empetrum hermaphroditum; Reproduction; Seed production; Vaccinium uliginosum","adaptation; alpine environment; arctic environment; climate change; dormancy; ecotype; fungus; germination; mortality; recruitment (population dynamics); regeneration; seed production; sexual reproduction; shrub; temperature effect; Empetrum hermaphroditum; Empetrum nigrum; Vaccinium; Vaccinium uliginosum",,,,,,"Alsos, I.G., Spjelkavik, S., Engleskjon, T., Seed bank size and composition of Betula nana, Vaccinium uliginosum, and Campanula rotundifolia habitats in Svalbard and northern Norway (2003) Can J Bot, 81, pp. 220-231; Alsos, I.G., Engelskjon, T., Gielly, L., Taberlet, P., Brochmann, C., Impact of ice ages on circumpolar molecular diversity: Insights from an ecological key species (2005) Mol Ecol, 14, pp. 2739-2753; Alsos, I.G., Eidesen, P.B., Ehrich, D., Skrede, I., Westergaard, K., Jacobsen, G.H., Landvik, J.Y., Brochmann, C., Frequent long-distance colonization in the changing Arctic (2007) Science, 316, pp. 1606-1609; (2002) S-PLUS 6.1 for Windows.
