H3C 3J7, Canada","A climate change resulting from recent increases in the atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) is supposed to occur sometime in the middle of the next century. This climate change induced by GHGs would be caused by radiative forcing through the greenhouse effect and would lead to global warming and eventually to sea-level rise. This paper presents a climate change scenario for the greater Caribbean as simulated by the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) general circulation model (GCM). The CCC GCM projects a GHG induced temperature increase of about 2°C and more extreme rainfall conditions for the greater Caribbean. The climate records of temperature, rainfall and cloudiness for several stations on the island of Trinidad are then examined in an attempt to detect GHG climate change signals. The temperature change to date, close to 1°C, and the fluctuations in rainfall patterns, over the last five decades, seem to be indicative of early greenhouse signals. © 1997 by the Royal Meteorological Society.","Caribbean; Climate change; Cloudiness; GCM data; Global warming; Rainfall; Temperature","climate change; global warming; Caribbean",,,,,,"Balling Jr., R.C., (1992) The Heated Debate: Greenhouse Predictions Versus Climate Reality, 195p. , Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, San Francisco, CA; Barnett, T.P., Global sea level change (1988) NCPO, Climate Variations over the Past Century and the Greenhouse Effect, , A report based on the First Climate Trends Workshop, 7-9 September 1988, Washington, DC, National Climate Program Office/NOAA, Rockville, MD; Boer, G.J., McFarlane, N.A., Lazare, M., Greenhouse gas-induced climate change simulated with the CCC second-generation General Circulation Model (1992) J Climate, 5 (10), pp. 1045-1077; Charlson, R.J., Schwartz, S.E., Hales, J.M., Cess, R.D., Coakley Jr., J.A., Hansen, J.E., Huffman, P.J., Climate forcing by anthropogenic aerosols (1992) Science, 255, pp. 423-430; Emanuel, K.A., On the maximum intensity of hurricanes (1987) J.
