Annual average precipitation would raise slightly, but the increment could be 4% in northeastern China. The increment of annual mean runoff could rise over 6% in the northeastern area, and decrease in the other regions 1.4 to 10.5%. The increased water shortage due to climate change could achieve 160 to 5090 million m3 in some areas of China. Financial loss due to the lack of water could reach 1300 million yuan, and up to 4400 million yuan in serious drought years in the Beijing-Tianjin- Tangshan area.","Adaptation; China; Climate change; Water resources","Financial loss; Impact assessment techniques; Water shortage; Atmospheric temperature; Computer simulation; Developing countries; Drought; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Runoff; Water resources; Climate change; climate change; temperature; water management; water supply; adaptation; article; China; environmental impact assessment; global climate; water management; water supply; China",,,,,,"Ying, A., (1995) Modelling Climate Change Impact on Water Resources in the middle and Upstream Regions of Yellow River, , International Symposium on Environment and Biometeorology, Beijing; Jiansheng, W., Impact of climate change on water resources of Jing-Jin-Tang Region (1996) Advances in Water Science, 7 (1). , March; Guo, S., Impact of climate change on hydrological balance and water resources systems in the Dongjiang Basin, China (1995) Modelling and Management of Sustainable Basin-scale Water Resource Systems, pp. 141-150. , (ed. by S.P.
