Such analyses have often emphasized the importance of anthropogenic factors and, in particular, changing land use of management practices over limescales beyond the scope of direct process monitoring. This paper examines several U.K. sediment yield chronologies within the context of mesoscale atmospheric circulation patterns. Changes in the frequency of the winter cyclonic Lamb weather type since 1861 were found to account for a significant proportion of the variation in sediment yields. The results also have implications for future sediment accumulation rates given the potential geomorphological consequences of global climate change. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Climate change; Lake sediments; Lamb weather types; Sediment yields",,,,,,,"Apleby, P.G., Oldfield, F., The calculation of lead-210 dates assuming a constant rate of supply or unsupported 210Pb to the sediment (1978) Catena, 5, pp. 1-8; Arnell, N.W., Jenkms, A., George, D.G., (1994) The Implications of Climate Change for the National Rivers Authority, , National Rivers Authority R & D Report 12, HMSO, London; Auzet, A.V., Boiffin, J., Papy, F., Ludwig, B., Maucorps, J., Rill erosion as a function of the characteristics of cultivated catchments in the north of France (1993) Catena, 20, pp. 41-62; Beven, K., Riverine flooding in a warmer Britain (1993) Geographical Journal, 159, pp. 157-161; Boardman, J., The sensitivity of Downland arable land to erosion by water (1993) Landscape Sensitivity, pp. 211-228. , Thomas, D.
