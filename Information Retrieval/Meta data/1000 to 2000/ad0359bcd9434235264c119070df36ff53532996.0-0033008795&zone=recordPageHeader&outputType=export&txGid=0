To reduce some of the uncertainties in predicting the responses of this key ecosystem, the climate change experiment (CLIMEX) exposed an entire undisturbed catchment of boreal vegetation to CO2 enrichment (560 ppmv) and climate change (+ 5 °C in winter, + 3 °C in summer) for three years (1994-96). This paper describes the leaf metabolic responses of the vegetation to the experimental treatment and model simulations of possible future changes in the hydrological and carbon balance of the site. Randomized intervention analysis of the leaf gas exchange measurements for the dominant species indicated Pinus sylvestris had significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher photosynthetic rates and Betula pubescens and Vaccinium myrtillus had significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower stomatal conductances after three years treatment compared to the controls. These responses led to sustained increases in leaf water-use efficiency of all species of trees and ground shrubs, as determined from carbon isotope analyses. Photosynthesis (A) vs. intercellular CO2 (c(i)) response curves (A/c(i) responses), RuBisCo analysis and leaf nitrogen data together suggested none of the species investigated exhibited down-regulation in photosynthetic capacity. At the whole ecosystem level, the improved water economy of the plants did not translate into increased catchment runoff. Modelling simulations for the site indicate this was most likely brought about by a compensatory increase in evapotranspiration. In terms of the carbon budget of the site, the ecosystem model indicates that increased CO2 and temperature would lead to boreal ecosystems of the type used in CLIMEX, and typical of much of southern Norway, acting as moderate net sinks for CO2.","Acclimation; CO2; Ecosystem modelling; Global warming; Leaf gas exchange","carbon dioxide; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem response; gas exchange; global warming; leaf; Betula pubescens; Pinus sylvestris; Vaccinium myrtillus",,,,,,"Beerling, D.J., Carbon isotope discrimination and stomatal responses of mature Pinus sylvestris L. trees exposed in situ for three years to elevated CO2 and temperature (1997) Acta Ocologica, 18, pp. 697-712; Beerling, D.J., Woodward, F.I., The climate change experiment (CLIMEX): Phenology and gas exchange responses of boreal vegetation to global change (1994) Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters, 4, pp. 17-26; Beerling, D.J., Woodward, F.I., Ecophysiological responses of plants (1995) The CLIMEX Project Whole Catchment Manipulation of CO2 and Temperature, pp. 96-112. , eds Dise NB, Jenkins A Commission of the European Communities, Brussels; Beerling, D.J., Woodward, F.I., Leaf stable carbon isotope composition records increased water-use efficiency of C3 plants in response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment (1995) Functional Ecology, 9, pp. 394-401; Beerling, D.J., Woodward, F.I., In situ responses of boreal vegetation to elevated CO2 and temperature· first season results (1996) Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters, 5, pp. 117-127; Beerling, D.J., Woodward, F.I., Lomas, M., Jenkins, A., Testing the responses of a dynamic global vegetation model to environmental change: A comparison of observations and predictions (1997) Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters, 6, pp. 439-450; Bender, M.E., Taylor, E., Tans, P., Francey, R., Lowe, D., Variability in the O2/N2 ratio of southern hemisphere air, 1991-94 implications for the carbon cycle (1996) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 10, pp. 9-21; Black, T.A., Hartog, G.D., Neuman, H.H., Annual cycles of water vapour and carbon dioxide fluxes in and above a boreal aspen forest (1996) Global Change Biology, 2, pp. 219-229; Callaway, R.M., DeLucia, E.H., Thomas, E.M., Schlesinger, W.H., Compensatory responses of CO2 exchange and biomass allocation and their effects on the relative growth rate of ponderosa pine in different CO2 and temperature regimes (1994) Oecologia, 98, pp. 159-166; Carpenter, S.R., Chisholm, S.W., Krebs, C.J., Schindler, D.W., Wright, R.F., Ecosystem experiments (1995) Science, 269, pp. 324-327; Carpenter, S.R., Frost, T.M., Heisley, D., Kratz, T.K., Randomized intervention analysis and the interpretation of whole-ecosystem experiments (1989) Ecology, 70, pp. 1142-1152; Ciais, P., Tans, P., Trolier, M., White, J., Francey, R., A large northern hemisphere terrestrial CO2 sink indicated by 13C/ 12C ratio of atmospheric CO2 (1995) Science, 269, pp. 1098-1102; Dickinson, R.E., Meleshko, V., Randall, D., Sarachik, E., Silva-Dias, P., Slingo, A., Climate processes (1996) Climate Change 1995 the Science of Climate Change, pp. 193-227. , eds Houghton JT, Meira Filho LG, Callander BA, Harris N, Kettenberg A, Maskell K.
