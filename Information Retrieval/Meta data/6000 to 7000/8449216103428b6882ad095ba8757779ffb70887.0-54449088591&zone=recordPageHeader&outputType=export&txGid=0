Here, using counts of waders (Charadrii) collected from ca. 3500 sites over 30 years and covering a major portion of western Europe, we present the largest-scale study to show that faunal abundance is influenced by climate in winter. We demonstrate that the 'weighted centroids' of populations of seven species of wader occurring in internationally important numbers have undergone substantial shifts of up to 115km, generally in a northeasterly direction. To our knowledge, this shift is greater than that recorded in any other study, but closer to what would be expected as a result of the spatial distribution of ecological zones. We establish that year-to-year changes in site abundance have been positively correlated with concurrent changes in temperature, but that this relationship is most marked towards the colder extremities of the birds' range, suggesting that shifts have occurred as a result of range expansion and that responses to climate change are temperature dependent. Many attempts to model the future impacts of climate change on the distribution of organisms, assume uniform responses or shifts throughout a species' range or with temperature, but our results suggest that this may not be a valid approach. We propose that, with warming temperatures, hitherto unsuitable sites in northeastern Europe will host increasingly important wader numbers, but that this may not be matched by declines elsewhere within the study area. The need to establish that such changes are occurring is accentuated by the statutory importance of this taxon in the designation of protected areas. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Conservation; Global change; Global warming; Range expansion; Range shift; Re-distribution; Shore bird; Special protection area","abundance; climate change; climate effect; fauna; geographical distribution; global change; protected area; range expansion; spatial distribution; species conservation; wader; winter; Eurasia; Europe; Western Europe; Aves; Charadrii; Scolopacidae",,,,,,"Atkinson, P.W., Clark, N.A., Bell, M.C., Dare, P.J., Clark, J.A., Ireland, P.L., Changes in commercially fished shellfish stocks and shorebird populations in the Wash, England (2003) Biological Conservation, 114, pp. 127-141; Austin, G.E., Rehfisch, M.M., Shifting nonbreeding distributions of migratory fauna in relation to climate change (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 31-38; Banks, A.N., Collier, M., Austin, G.E., Hearn, R., Musgrove, A., (2006) Waterbirds in the UK 2004-05: The Wetland Bird Survey, , BTO/WWT/RSPB/JNCC Thetford; Begon, M., Townsend, C., Harper, J., (2005) Ecology: From Individuals to Ecosystems, , Blackwell Oxford; Berrevoets, C.M., Strucker, R.C.W., Arts, F.A., Meininger, P.L., Watervogels in de Zoute Delta 2001/2002 (2002) RIKZ Report 2003.001, , Rijksinstitu ut voor Kust en Zee, Middelburg; Berry, P.M., Dawson, T.P., Harrison, P.A., Pearson, R.G., Modelling potential impacts of climate change on the bioclimatic envelope of species in Britain and Ireland (2002) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 11, pp. 453-462; (2004) Birds in Europe: Population Estimate, Trends and Conservation Status, , BirdLife International BirdLife Conservation Series No. 12, BirdLife International, Cambridge; Blew, J., Günther, K., Südbeck, P., Bestandsentwicklun der im deutschen Wattenmeer rastenden Wat-und Wasservögel von 1987/1988 bis 2001/2002 (2005) Vogelwelt, 125, pp. 99-125; Both, C., Visser, M.E., Adjustment to climate change is constrained by arrival date in a long-distance migrant bird (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 296-298; Brown, J.L., The buffer effect and productivity in tit populations (1969) The American Naturalist, 103, pp. 347-354; Burton, N.H.K., Fuller, R.A., Eaton, M.A., Between-year changes in the wintering sites of Ruddy Turnstones Arenaria interpres: A response to diminished food resources (2005) Wader Study Group Bulletin, 107, pp. 36-39; Burton, N.H.K., Rehfisch, M.M., Clark, N.A., Dodd, S.G., Impacts of sudden winter habitat loss on the body condition and survival of redshank Tringa totanus (2006) Journal of Applied Ecology, 43, pp. 464-473; Camphuysen, C.J., Ens, B.J., Heg, D., Hulsita, J.B., van der Meer, J., Smit, C.J., Oystercatcher winter mortality in The Netherlands: The effects of severe weather and food supply (1996) Ardea, 84 A, pp. 469-492; Colhoun, K., (2001) I-WeBS Report 1998-99: Results of the Fifth Winter of the Irish Wetland Bird Survey, , BirdWatch Ireland Dublin; Connell, J.H., The influence of interspecific competition and other factors on the distribution of the Barnacle Chthamalus stellatus (1961) Ecology, 42, pp. 710-723; Connell, J.H., On the prevalence and relative importance of interspecific competition: Evidence from field experiments (1983) The American Naturalist, 122, pp. 661-696; Deceuninck, B., Waterbirds censused in mid-January in France: Importance of protected areas for wintering birds and trends over 1983-2002 (2005) Proceedings of the 28th French Conference for Ornithology, , November 28-30, 2003, Namur; Delany, S., Scott, D., (2006) Waterbird Population Estimates: Fourth Edition, , Wetlands International, Wageningen, the Netherlands; Devos, K., Numbers and population trends of waders along the Belgian North Sea coast (2008) International Wader Studies, 18, pp. 55-61; Fretwell, S.D., Lucas, H.L., On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds: I.
