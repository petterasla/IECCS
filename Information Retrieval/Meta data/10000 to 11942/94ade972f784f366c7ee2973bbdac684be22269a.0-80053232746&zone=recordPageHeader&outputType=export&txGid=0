The investigated Lysina and Pluhův Bor catchments are situated in the Slavkov Forest in western Czech Republic. To forecast hydrological patterns for the period 2071-2100, outputs from 2 general circulation models, HadAM3H and ECHAM4/OPYC3, were downscaled using 3 regional climate models (RCM; RCAO, CHRM, HIRHAM) under the A2 and B2 emission scenarios (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios). Corrected RCM daily outputs were used in combination with the hydrological model Brook90. Annual runoff is projected to decline by 10 to 30%, and impacts on the distribution of monthly flow are projected to be significant, with summer- autumn decreases of 30 to 95%, and winter increases of up to ∼40% compared to mean discharge for the period 1967-1990. Mean daily flows are estimated to decrease by ∼70% from August to November. These changes would have serious ecological consequences since streams could regularly dry up for short periods. © Inter-Research 2011.","Brook90; Climate change impact; Flow pattern; Headwater catchments; Hydrological modelling; Regional climate scenarios","Brook90; Climate change impact; Headwater catchment; Hydrological modelling; Regional climate; Catchments; Climate models; Ecology; Flow patterns; Runoff; Water supply; Climate change; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate effect; climate prediction; downscaling; evapotranspiration; flow pattern; forested catchment; global climate; headwater; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; rainfall-runoff modeling; runoff; seasonality; weather forecasting; Czech Republic",,,,,,"Christensen, J.H., Christensen, O.B., A summary of the PRUDENCE model projections of changes in European climate by the end of this century (2007) Climatic Change, 81 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 7-30. , DOI 10.1007/s10584-006-9210-7, Prediction of Regional Scenarios and Uncertainties for Defining European Climate Change Risks and Effects: The PRUDENCE Project; Christensen, J.H., Boberg, F., Christensen, O.B., Lucas-Picher, P., On the need for bias correction of regional climate change projections of temperature and precipitation (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35, pp. L20709. , doi:10.1029/2008GL035694; Clapp, R.B., Hornberger, G.M., Empirical equations for some soil hydraulic properties (1978) Water Resour Res, 14, pp. 601-604; Crawley, M.J., (2002) Statistical Computing.
