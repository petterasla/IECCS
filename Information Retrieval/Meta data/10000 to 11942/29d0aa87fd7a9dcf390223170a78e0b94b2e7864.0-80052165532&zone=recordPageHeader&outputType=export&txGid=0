The former is one of the major contributors to build-up the greenhouse effect implicated in global climate change and the latter produces acid rain. Oxy-fuel combustion is a technology, which consists in burning the fuel with a mix of pure O2 and recirculated CO2. With this technology the CO2 concentration in the flue gas may be enriched up to 95%, becoming possible an easy CO2 recovery. In addition, oxy-fuel combustion in fluidized beds allows in situ desulfurization of combustion gases by supplying calcium based sorbent.In this work, the effect of the principal operation variables affecting the sulfation reaction rate in fluidized bed reactors (temperature, CO2 partial pressure, SO2 concentration and particle size) under typical oxy-fuel combustion conditions have been analyzed in a batch fluidized bed reactor using a limestone as sorbent. It has been observed that sulfur retention can be carried out by direct sulfation of the CaCO3 or by sulfation of the CaO (indirect sulfation) formed by CaCO3 calcination. Direct sulfation and indirect sulfation operating conditions depended on the temperature and CO2 partial pressure. The rate of direct sulfation rose with temperature and the rate of indirect sulfation for long reaction times decreased with temperature. An increase in the CO2 partial pressure had a negative influence on the sulfation conversion reached by the limestone due to a higher temperature was needed to work in conditions of indirect sulfation. Thus, it is expected that the optimum temperature for sulfur retention in oxy-fuel combustion in fluidized bed reactors be about 925-950°C. Sulfation reaction rate rose with decreasing sorbent particle size and increasing SO2 concentration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Calcium based sorbents; Fluidized beds; Oxy-fuel combustion; SO2 retention; Sulfation","Calcium based sorbent; Combustion gas; Combustion pro-cess; Energy productions; Fluidized bed reactors; Global climate changes; Higher temperatures; In-situ; Negative influence; Operating condition; Operation variables; Optimum temperature; Oxy-fuels; Oxyfuel combustion; Polluting gas; SO<sub>2</sub> retention; Sorbent particles; Sulfation; Sulfation reaction; Sulfur retention; Acid rain; Atmospheric composition; Batch reactors; Calcination; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Desulfurization; Flue gases; Fluid catalytic cracking; Fluidization; Fluidized bed furnaces; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; In situ combustion; Limestone; Partial pressure; Pressure effects; Reaction rates; Sorption; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Fluidized bed combustion; carbon dioxide; climate change; combustion; fossil fuel; global climate; greenhouse effect; limestone; partial pressure; sulfur dioxide; temperature",,,,,,"Abanades, J.C., de Diego, L.F., García-Labiano, F., Adánez, J., Residual activity of sorben particles with a long residence time in a CFBC (2000) AIChE J., 46, pp. 1888-1893; Abanades, J.C., Anthony, E.J., García-Labiano, F., Jia, L., Progress of sulfation in highly sulfated particles of lime (2003) Ind.
