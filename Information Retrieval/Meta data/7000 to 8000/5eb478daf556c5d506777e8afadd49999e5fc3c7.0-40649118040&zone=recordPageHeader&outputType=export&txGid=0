There is a lack of understanding how these detritus C stocks may respond to climate change. This study used a nation-wide inventory of CWD and FWD in the United States to examine how these C stocks vary by latitude. Results indicate that the highest CWD and FWD C stocks are found in forests with the highest latitude, while conversely the lowest C stocks are found in the most southerly forests. CWD and FWD respond differently to changes in latitude with CWD C stocks decreasing more rapidly as latitude decreased. If latitude can be broadly assumed to indicate temperature and potential rate of detrital decay, it may be postulated that CWD C stocks may be at the highest risk of becoming a net C source if temperatures increase. The latitude at which CWD and FWD C stocks roughly equal each other (equilibrium point) may serve as an indicator of changes in C stock equilibrium under a global warming scenario. Given the complex relationships between detrital C stocks, biomass production/decay, and climatic variables, further research is suggested to refine this study's indicator.","Carbon; Climate change; Coarse woody debris; Fine woody debris; Latitude","Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Risk assessment; Coarse woody debris; Latitudinal gradients; Wood wastes; biomass allocation; carbon sequestration; climate change; coarse woody debris; forest ecosystem; forest resource; global warming; indicator mineral; longitudinal gradient; temperature gradient; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forests; Risk Assessment; Wood Waste; North America; United States",,,,,,"Baker, T.R., Honorio Coronado, E.N., Phillips, O.L., Martin, J., van der Heijden, G.M.F., Garcia, M., Espejo, J.S., Low stocks of coarse woody debris in a southwest Amazonian forest (2007) Oecologia, 152, pp. 495-504; Bechtold, W.A., Patterson, P.L.
