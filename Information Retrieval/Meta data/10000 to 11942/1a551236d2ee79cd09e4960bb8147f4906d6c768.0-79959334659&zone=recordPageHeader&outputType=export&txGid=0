A forty-sector global economic input-output table is constructed through an integration and extension of existing statistics which covers thirty-four countries accounting for about 80% of the world economy. Global inventories for ecological endowments of six categories, i.e., greenhouse gas emissions, energy sources, water resources, exergy resources, solar emergy resources, and cosmic emergy resources, are accounted in detail. As a result of the modeling, embodied intensities of different ecological endowments are obtained for all forty sectors, based on which the sectoral embodiments for consumptive and productive uses are presented separately. Results of this study provide a sound scientific database for policy making on global climate change mitigation as well as on global resources management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Emergy; Greenhouse gas; Input-output modeling; Natural resources; World economy","Emergy; Energy source; Exergy resources; Global climate changes; Global economics; Global inventories; Global resources; Input-output modeling; Input-Output table; Policy making; Scientific database; World economy; Associated gas; Ecology; Exergy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources management; Solar energy; Water resources; Gas emissions; biophysics; climate change; database; ecological economics; ecological modeling; emission inventory; energy efficiency; exergy; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; integrated approach; natural resource; numerical model; policy making; resource management; water resource",,,,,,"(2008) ACPI Almanac of China's Paper Industry 2007, , China Petrochemical Press, Beijing, China, (in Chinese); (1983) AEM Agricultural Economic Manual, , Agriculture Press, Beijing, (in Chinese); Ahmad, N., Wyckoff, A.W., (2003), Carbon dioxide emissions embodied in international trade of goods.
