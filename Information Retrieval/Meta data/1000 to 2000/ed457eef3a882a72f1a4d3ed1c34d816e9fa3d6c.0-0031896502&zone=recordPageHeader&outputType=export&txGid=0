However, on the basis of information available in the literature, it is possible to make predictions about the physiological responses of plants under situations of anticipated increases in CO2 concentrations, temperature and UV-B fluxes and point out how differences in the responses of major marine plant groups might lead to changes in performance and distribution of these organisms. For instance we may predict that macrophytes such as seagrasses will show enhanced photosynthetic rates and growth as atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise whilst many intertidal macroalgae are already at CO2 saturation and may not show any enhanced performance as CO2 increases. Decreasing ozone concentrations in the stratosphere will lead to enhanced UV-B fluxes and could consequently favour those species with UV tolerance or repair mechanisms. It has been suggested that interactions between temperature range and photoperiod can be responsible for excluding species from particular regions of the world's oceans. Other species might be affected in this way as temperatures at a given latitude change. Temperature will also influence the relationship between atmospheric and dissolved CO2 and the proportions of the various components of dissolved inorganic carbon available for growth. Climate change may well have other effects on the efficiency with which marine plants use other resources such as N, Fe or Zn and these will also be discussed.",,"biodiversity; carbon dioixde; carbon dioxide; climatic change; ultraviolet-B",,,,,,"Anderson, J.G., Toohey, D.W., Brune, W.H., Free radicals within the Antarctic vortex: The role of CFCs in Antarctic ozone loss (1991) Science, 251, pp. 39-46; Arthur, M.A., Hinga, K.R., Pilson, M.E.Q., Whitaker, E., Allard, D., Estimates of pCO2 for the last 120 My based on δ13C of marine phytoplankton organic matter (1991) EOS Trans AGU, 72, p. 166; Barry, J.P., Baxter, C.H., Sagarin, R.D., Gilman, S.E., Climate-related, long term faunal changes in a California rocky intertidal community (1995) Science, 267, pp. 672-675; Bazzaz, F.A., The response of natural ecosystems to the rising global CO2 levels (1990) Ann.
