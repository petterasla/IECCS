Due to a superlinear scaling of the computational burden dictated by stability criterion, the solution of the equations of motion dominate the calculation at ultra-high resolutions. From this extrapolation, it is estimated that a credible kilometer scale atmospheric model would require at least a sustained ten petaflop computer to provide scientifically useful climate simulations. Our design study portends an alternate strategy for practical power-efficient implementations of petaflop scale systems. Embedded processor technology could be exploited to tailor a custom machine designed to ultra-high climate model specifications at relatively affordable cost and power considerations. The major conceptual changes required by a kilometer scale climate model are certain to be difficult to implement. Although the hardware, software, and algorithms are all equally critical in conducting ultra-high climate resolution studies, it is likely that the necessary petaflop computing technology will be available in advance of a credible kilometer scale climate model. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Atmospheric general circulation model; Climate model; Embedded processor; Finite volume model; Global warming; Petascale simulation; Power efficient computing","Atmospheric movements; Equations of motion; Extrapolation; Finite volume method; Atmospheric general circulation model; Petascale simulation; Power efficient computing; Global warming",,,,,,"Adcroft, A., Campin, J.-M., Hill, C., Marshall, J., Implementation of an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model on the expanded spherical cube (2004) Mon.
