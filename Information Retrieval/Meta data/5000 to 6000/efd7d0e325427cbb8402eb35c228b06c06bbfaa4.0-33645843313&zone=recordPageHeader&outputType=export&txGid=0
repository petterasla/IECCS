The investigations are focussed on the major part of the German Rhine catchment with a drainage area of approx. 110,000 km2. This area is subdivided into 23 subcatchments. In a first step, the hydrological model HBV-D serves to simulate runoff conditions under present climate for the individual subbasins. Simulated, large scale atmospheric fields, provided by two different Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and driven by the emission scenario IS95a (""business as usual"") are then used as input to the method of expanded downscaling (EDS). EDS delivers local time series of scenario climate as input to HBV-D. In a final step, the investigations are focussed on the assessment of possible future runoff conditions under the impact of climate change. The study indicates a potential increase in precipitation, mean runoff and flood discharge for small return intervals. However, the uncertainty range that originates from the application of the whole model chain and two different GCMs is high. This leads to high cumulative uncertainties, which do not allow conclusions to be drawn on the development of future extreme floods. © Springer 2006.","Climate change; Floods; Regional hydrology; Uncertainty","catchment; climate change; discharge; flood; hydrology; runoff; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Rhine Basin; Hepatitis B virus",,,,,,"Bendix, J., Natural and human impacts on the flood discharge of the Rhine (1997) Erdkunde, 51, pp. 292-307; Bergström, S., The HBV model, Computer Models of Watershed Hydrology (1995) Computer Models of Watershed Hydrology, pp. 443-476. , V.
