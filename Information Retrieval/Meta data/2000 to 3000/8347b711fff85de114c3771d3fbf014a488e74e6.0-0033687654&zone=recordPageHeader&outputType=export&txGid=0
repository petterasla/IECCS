The reduction of α-Fe2O3 (hematite) by ball-milling with hydrogen gas flow was studied by XRD, SEM, TEM and Moessbauer spectroscopy. Iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) powder was charged into a container for ball-milling with stainless steel balls. The container was designed to flow gas during ball-milling process. It has two holes, one of which is for inducing hydrogen gas into container, other one is for exhausting a producing gas out of the container. Milling was interrupted to take samples for estimating the deoxidization process. Charging and removal of the samples were done in a high purity argon atmosphere. A vibrating ball-mill machine was used. The results of X-ray diffraction measurement show that the reduction of iron-oxide starts at 18.0 ks of ball-milling. The intensity of Bragg peaks corresponding to the Fe2O3 decreased with milling time. Conversely to this, the intensity of Bragg peaks of α-Fe increased. At 216.0 ks of milling, almost the Bragg peaks of Fe2O3 disappeared and the only Bragg peaks of α-Fe remained. During this reducing process, Fe3O4 and FeO appeared as intermediate states between α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe. Nano-crystalline Fe was obtained by the reduction of iron-oxide by ball-milling with hydrogen gas flow.",,"Ball milling; Exhaust gases; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen; Nanostructured materials; Reduction; Scanning electron microscopy; Stainless steel; Transmission electron microscopy; Water; Bragg peaks; Deoxidization; Hydrogen gas flow; Iron oxides",,,,,,"Tokumitsu, K., Nasu, T., Suzuki, K., Greer, A.L., (1998) Mater.Sci.Forum, 269-272, p. 181; Nasu, T., Tokumitsu, K., Miyazawa, K., Greer, A.L., Suzuki, K., Mater.Sci.Forum, , in press","Nasu, T.; Yamagata Univ, Yamagata, Japan",,"DFG;IFW;SMWK;Fritsch GmbH","Trans Tech Publ, Uetikon-Zuerich, Switzerland","ISMANAM-99: The International Symposium on Metastable, Mechanically Alloyed and Nanocrystalline Materials","30 August 1999 through 3 September 1999","Dresden, Ger",57068,02555476,,MSFOE,,"English","Mater Sci Forum",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033687654
