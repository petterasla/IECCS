Whilst recent observations of decreasing Arctic sea ice extent are consistent with this scenario, the possibility that such a trend is attributable to local effects at the ice margins rather than to atmospheric warming cannot be dismissed. In the absence of direct air temperature measurements, warming over Arctic sea ice may be inferred from an increasing duration of the summer melt season. Analysis presented here of the dates of spring melt and autumn freeze-up observed over a large fraction of perennial Arctic sea ice using passive microwave data from the SMMR and SSM/I from 1979 to 1996 reveals an increase of 5.3 days (8%) per decade in the number of melt days per summer.",,"Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Sea ice; Temperature measurement; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Numerical analysis; Air temperature measurement; Albedo feedbacks; Arctic sea ice; Atmospheric warming; Freeze-up; General circulation model; Local effects; Passive microwave data; Ice; Sea ice; Melt season; Perennial Arctic sea ice; global warming; sea ice; Arctic Ocean",,,,,,"Aagaard, K., Carmack, E.C., The role of sea ice and other fresh water in the Arctic circulation (1989) J.
