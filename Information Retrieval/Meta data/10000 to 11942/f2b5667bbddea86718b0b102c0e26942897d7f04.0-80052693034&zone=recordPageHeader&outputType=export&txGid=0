Materials and methods: Data have been gathered for the manufacture and application of the two different powder coatings. The case study is a cradle-to-gate study, using retrospective data. The data were entered into the SimaPro 7.2.4 LCA software and environmental impacts calculated using IPPC 2007, CML-IA and USEtox™ classification and characterisation methods. The USEtox methods were used both with and without interim factors, and this distinction was very important for the ranking of the alternatives. The study was performed using the functional unit: Surface treatment of the ""foot-cross"" of one H05 5300 office chair for 15 years (the lifetime of the chair), where the reference flow was 172 g of powder coating to fulfil this function. Literature about the known health effects associated with chemicals in the two solutions was also consulted in order to assess whether the main concerns driving the desire to replace the epoxy-based powder coating have been addressed and improved through using the polyester-based alternative. Results and discussion: The life cycle environmental impacts evaluated show improvements in the potential environmental impacts analysed due to the substitute polyester-based coating. The results for human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity potentials are dependent on the inclusion of interim characterisation factors. Literature sources provide evidence of irritation and sensitisation effects associated with epoxy resin, but not for the polyester resin alternative. Conclusions: Substitution of the epoxy-based coating by a polyester-based alternative reduces the occupational health risk for workers coming into contact with the powder coating. The results show that this substitution has also led to reduced potential environmental impacts: global warming, ozone depletion, photochemical oxidant creation, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity, when the interim factors for some metals and organics are included in the USEtox calculations. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Case study; Furniture; Life cycle assessment; Powder coatings; USEtox","epoxy resin; polyester; acidification; article; data analysis software; ecotoxicity; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; health hazard; life cycle assessment method; limnology; material coating; mathematical parameters; molecular weight; ozone depletion; photochemistry; powder; priority journal; product development; USEtox method",,,,,,"Baumann, H., Tillman, A.M., (2004) The Hitch Hiker's Guide to LCA: An Orientation in Life Cycle Assessment Methodology and Application, , Studentlitteratur Lund; (2010) CML-IA Characterisation Factors, , http://cml.leiden.edu/software/data-cmlia.html, CML Accessed27May2010; (2007) Off J Eur Union L, 136. , Commission of the European Communities Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC and 2000/21/EC 29.5.2007; Crepy, M.N., Jonathan, A.M., Pera, R., Choudat, D., The florist: An unusual occupational exposure to epoxy resins (2006) Archives des Maladies Professionnelles et de l'Environnement, 67 (4), pp. 639-642; Diamond, M.L., Gandhi, N., Adams, W.J., Atherton, J., Bhavsar, S.P., Bulle, C., Campbell, P.G.C., Vijver, M.G., The clearwater consensus: The estimation of metal hazard in fresh water (2010) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 15 (2), pp. 143-147. , 10.1007/s11367-009-0140-2 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXhslWntro%3D; (2011), http://www.ecoinvent.org/, Accessed14Mar2011Ekvall, T., Tillman, A.-M., Molander, S., Normative ethics and methodology for life cycle assessment (2005) Journal of Cleaner Production, 13 (13-14), pp. 1225-1234. , DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2005.05.010, PII S0959652605001149, Life Cycle Assessment; (2010), http://www.sciencedirect.com/, AccessedMay2010(2010) Handbook-general Guide for Life Cycle Assessment-detailed Guidance, , European Commission International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) First edition March 2010.
