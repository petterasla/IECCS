Fire burns large areas annually, much of it in low-severity surface fires - but data on fire area and impacts or extent of varying fire severity are poor. Changes in land use, cover, and disturbance patterns such as those predicted by global climate change models, have the potential to greatly alter current fire regimes in boreal forests and to significantly impact global carbon budgets. The extent and global importance of fires in the boreal zone have often been greatly underestimated. For the 1998 fire season we estimate from remote sensing data that about 13.3 million ha burned in Siberia. This is about 5 times higher than estimates from the Russian Aerial Forest Protection Service (Avialesookhrana) for the same period. We estimate that fires in the Russian boreal forest in 1998 constituted some 14-20% of average annual global carbon emissions from forest fires. Average annual emissions from boreal zone forests may be equivalent to 23-39% of regional fossil fuel emissions in Canada and Russia, respectively. But the lack of accurate data and models introduces large potential errors into these estimates. Improved monitoring and understanding of the landscape extent and severity of fires and effects of fire on carbon storage, air chemistry, vegetation dynamics and structure, and forest health and productivity are essential to provide inputs into global and regional models of carbon cycling and atmospheric chemistry.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Environmental protection; Fires; Land use; Particulate emissions; Remote sensing; Soils; Vegetation; Forest fires; Forestry; carbon cycle; emission; forest fire; Russian Federation",,,,,,"Fire management programs fire statistics (2001) Fire Statistics for the State of Alaska, Division of Forestry, , www.dnr.state.ak.us/forestry/firestats.htm#98, 1998 Season Statistics; Alexeyev, V.A., Birdsey, R.A., (1994) Carbon in Ecosystems of Forests and Peatlands of Russia (in Russian), , Sukachev Institute of Forest Research, Krasnoyarsk, Russia, 170 pp. + appendix; Alexeyev, V., Birdsey, R.A., Stakanov, V., Korotkov, I., Carbon in vegetation of Russian forests: Methods to estimate storage and geographical distribution (1995) Water Air Soil Pollut., 82, pp. 271-282; Amiro, B.D., Todd, J.B., Wotton, B.M., Logan, K.A., Flannigan, M.D., Stocks, B.J., Mason, J.A., Hirsch, K.G., Direct carbon emissions from Canadian fires, 1959-1999 (2001) Can.
