Although product-specific criteria for the label are developed by taking into account potential energy savings, more robust criteria need to be developed to minimize energy consumption (and consequential global warming potential (GWP)). The objectives of this study are: (i) to measure what we refer to as the technical and cost efficiencies of products with respect to the relative Energy Star criteria achievement rate and GWP, respectively; and (ii) to analyze the relationship between these efficiencies and product design features, using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). As an example, these analyses are applied to data for desktop computers. The results indicate that desktop computer manufacturers currently achieve energy savings that exceed those required by the Energy Star label. The principal product design features affecting the efficiencies are primarily the efficiency and power capacity of the power supply and the number of cores in the central processing unit. This study can help the program develop more robust criteria that ultimately reduce GWP and can provide guidance to manufacturers to strategically improve energy efficiency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Energy Star program; Product design","Cost efficiency; Design features; Desktop computer; Energy star; Energy Star labels; Energy Star program; Global warming potential; Measurement and analysis; Power capacity; Power supply; Relative energies; Robust criteria; Stochastic frontier analysis; Data envelopment analysis; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Manufacture; Personal computers; Product design; Program processors; Stars; Energy efficiency; ecolabeling; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; sustainable development",,,,,,"Agrell, P.J., Bogetoft, P., Economic and environmental efficiencey of district heating plants (2005) Energy Policy, 33, pp. 1351-1362; (2009), Banxia Software Ltd., An Introduction to Frontier Analyst 4Bian, Y., Yang, F., Resource and environment efficiency analysis of provinces in China: a DEA approach based on Shannon's entropy (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 1909-1917; Bishop, P., Brand, S., The efficiency of museums: a stochastic frontier production function approach (2003) Applied Economics, 35, pp. 1853-1858; Coelli, T.J., A Guide to FRONTIER Version 4.1: A Computer Program for Stochastic Frontier Production and Cost Function Estimation.
