Emissions of greenhouse gases have been evaluated for the agronomic and industrial production processes and product uses involved. Calculations of changes in the energy balance from 1985 to 1996 indicate that increasing fossil fuel consumption resulting from agricultural mechanisation is largely being offset by technological advances in transportation and overall efficiency gains. Output/input energy ratios have grown to an average of 9.2 and net reductions in CO2 emissions, due to ethanol use and substitution of bagasse for fossil fuels, are in the order of 46.7m tonnes p.a. (equivalent to nearly 20% of all CO2 emissions from fuels in Brazil). Ethanol use alone is responsible for 64% of the net avoided emissions.",,,,,,,,"Macedo, (1992) Biomass and Bioenergy, 3, pp. 77-80; Macedo, Nogueira, (1985) Boletim Tecnico Copersucar, 31, pp. 22-27; (1997) Pagamento de Cana Pelo Teor de Sacarose: Relatorio Final, 96-97. , Centro de Tecnologia Copersucar, Piracicaba, S.
