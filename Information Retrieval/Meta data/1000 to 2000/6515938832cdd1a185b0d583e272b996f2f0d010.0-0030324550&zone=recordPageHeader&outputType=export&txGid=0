N2L 3G1, Canada","Preliminary data are examined from a project in which the variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation across northern Canada and the implications for paleoclimatic reconstruction are examined. The data set shows a geographic variability of about 6‰ in isotopic composition of precipitation across the Canadian Arctic, roughly double the temporal variability seen in the ice core records from the last 10,000 years. The seasonal variability in average monthly δ18 values from the arctic stations in 1991 was as much as 26‰. A snow and firn core collected on Bylot Island had a range of 14.8‰, compared to the range in average monthly precipitation of 25.6‰ covering the same time period. This difference in the observed seasonal range of values is the result of processes operating in the snow pack, such as vapor movement and molecular diffusion, and the strategy used in sampling the core. The results indicate that a much better understanding of the geographic and seasonal variation in the δ18O values of precipitation is required before a direct linkage between the isotope records in ice cores and global climate change can be determined. Using recently developed radiocarbon dating techniques, buried glacier ice that has been preserved in permafrost may be able to provide the greater spatial and temporal detail required.",,"atmospheric chemistry; climate indicator; isotope; precipitation chemistry; Canada, Canadian Arctic",,,,,,"Ahlmann, H.W., Glacier Variations and Climatic Fluctuations (1953) Bowman Memorial Lectures, 51p. , Series 3: American Geographical Society, New York; Alt, B.T., Synoptic climate controls of mass balance variations on Devon Island Ice Cap (1978) Arctic and Alpine Research, 10, pp. 61-80; Alt, B.T., Investigation of summer synoptic climate controls on the mass balance of Meighen Ice cap (1979) Atmosphere-Ocean, 17, pp. 181-199; Andrews, J.T., Barry, R.G., Draper, L., An inventory of the present and past glacierisation of Home Bay and Okoa Bay, east Baffin Island, N.W.T., Canada, and some climatic and paleoclimatic considerations (1970) Journal of Glaciology, 9, pp. 337-362; Andrews, J.T., Barnett, D.M., Holocene (Neoglacial) moraine and proglacial lake chronology, Barnes Ice Cap, Canada (1979) Boreas, 8, pp. 341-358; Hydrology of the Lewis Glacier, north-central Baffin Island, N.W.T., and discussion of reliability of the measurements (1967) Geographical Bulletin, 9, pp. 232-261; Baird, P.D., Ward, W.H., Orvig, S., The glaciological studies of the Baffin Island Expedition, 1950: Parts 1 & 2 (1952) Journal of Glaciology, 2 (11), pp. 2-23; Benson, C.S., Stratigraphic studies in the snow and firn of the Greenland Ice Sheet (1961) Folia Geographica Danica, 9, pp. 13-37; Berger, A.R., Lams, W.J., Geoindicators (1996) Assessing Rapid Environmental Changes in Earth Systems, , A.A.
