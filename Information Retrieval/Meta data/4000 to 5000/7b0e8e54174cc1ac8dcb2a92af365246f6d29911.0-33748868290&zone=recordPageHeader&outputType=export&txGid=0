Box 2871, Beijing 100085, China","Testing the effects of iron fertilization in booming metabolism of microbes in North Pacific Ocean has become an important hot topic in current global climate change study. The first supportive evidence with natural iron inputs to ocean was obtained by Bishop and his colleagues at the PAPA region in North Pacific Ocean. They found a rapid increase of marine phytoplankton over North Pacific Ocean after a strong dust storm in April 2001. We demonstrate that the dust deposition flux during this dust storm period decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the dust source regions along the dust transport pathway, through integration of synoptic dynamics, changes of TOMS-Al (aerosol index) and surface PM10 values along the dust pathway and changes of particulate organic carbon and chlorophyll in surface oceans. This strong dust storm may result in deposition of about 3.1-5.8 μg/m3 eolian iron into the PAPA region in North Pacific Ocean, thus causing a rapid increase of marine phytoplankton productivity observed by Bishop and his colleagues. This work supplies more direct and detailed evidence, from continental dust process, to support the iron hypothesis with natural iron inputs to the surface oceans through dust storms. © Science in China Press 2006.","Bio-environmental effects; Dust fluxes; Hypothesis of iron fertilization; Long-distance dust transport; North Pacific Ocean",,,,,,,"Martin, J.H., Glacial-interglacial CO2 change: The iron hypothesis (1990) Paleoceanography, 5, pp. 1-13; Coale, K.H., Johnson, K.S., Fitzwater, S.E., A massive phytoplankton bloom induced by an ecosystem-scale iron fertilization experiment in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (1996) Nature, 383, pp. 495-501; Watson, A.J., Bakker, D.C.E., Ridgwell, A.J., Al, E., Effect of iron supply on Southern Ocean CO2 uptake and implications for glacial atmospheric CO2 (2000) Nature, 407, pp. 730-733; Duce, R.A., Unni, C.K., Ray, B.J., Long-range atmospheric transport of soil dust from Asia to the tropical North Pacific: Temporal variability (1980) Science, 209, pp. 1522-1524; Petit, J.R., Jouzel, J., Raynaud, D., Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica (1999) Nature, 339, pp. 429-436; Ridgwell, A.J., Feedback in the earth system: The biogeochemical linking of land, air and sea (2002) IGBP 'Global Change' Newsletter, 360, pp. 2905-2924; Ridgwell, A.J., Implications of the global CO2 ""Iron hypothesis"" for Quaternary climate change (2003) Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geo-systems, 4 (9), p. 1076. , doi:10.1029/2003GC000563; Bishop, J.K.B., Davis, R.E., Sherman, J.T., Robotic Observations of Dust Storm enhancement of Carbon Biomass in the North Pacific (2002) Science, 298, pp. 817-821; Jaffe, D., Snow, J., Cooper, O., The 2001 Asian dust events: Transport and impact on surface aerosol concentrations in the U.S (2003) EOS, 84 (46), pp. 501-516; Merrill, J.T., Uematsu, M., Bleck, R., Meteorological analysis of long range transport of mineral aerosol over the North Pacific (1989) J.
