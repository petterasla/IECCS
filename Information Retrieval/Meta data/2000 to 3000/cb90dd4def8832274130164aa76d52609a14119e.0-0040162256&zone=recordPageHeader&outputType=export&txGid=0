Bioethanol is clean burning, has high octane numbers, is renewable and does not contribute to global warming. However, in the absence of tax credits, the production of bioethanol is less attractive. A determination of return-on-investment was carried out based on tests to optimise the co-production of bioethanol and a high-value product, glycerol. Using corn or milo (grain sorghum) as the raw material, the return-on-investment increases from 12.3% (bioethanol) to 19.7% (bioethanol plus glycerol). When blackstrap molasses is the raw material, the return-on-investment increases from 12.8% (bioethanol) to 22.3% (bioethanol plus glycerol). Therefore, value-added products such as glycerol are the key to making fuel ethanol plants profitable now and in the future.",,,,,,,,"Agarwal, G.P., Glycerol.
