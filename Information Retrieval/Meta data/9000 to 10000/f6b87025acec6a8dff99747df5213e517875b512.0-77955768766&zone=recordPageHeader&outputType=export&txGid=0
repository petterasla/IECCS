Timing requires both the ability to accurately interpret the appropriate environmental cues, and the flexibility to respond to inter-annual variation in these cues. Determining which cues are linked to reproductive timing, what these cues are predicting and understanding the fitness consequences of variation in timing, is therefore of paramount interest to evolutionary and applied ecologists, especially in the face of global climate change. We investigated inter-annual relationships between climatic variation and the timing of reproduction in Canada's largest breeding population of Arctic common eiders (Somateria mollissima) in East Bay, Nunavut. Warmer spring temperatures predicted both earlier mean annual laying dates and the earlier ice-free conditions required by ducklings for post-natal growth. Warmer springs had higher variation in this temperature cue, and the population laying distribution became increasingly positively-skewed in warmer summers, potentially indicating that more low quality females had the opportunity to commence laying in warmer years. Females that timed laying to match duckling hatching just prior to fully ice-free conditions obtained the highest duckling survival probability. Inter-annual data on repeated breeding attempts revealed that the individuals examined show a similar degree of laying flexibility in response to climatic variation; however, there was significant individual variation in the absolute timing of laying within an average year. This work sheds light on how reproductive timing is related to and influenced by variation in local climate and provides vital information on how climate-related variation in reproductive timing influence a fitness measure in an Arctic species. Results are especially relevant to future work in polar environments given that global climatic changes are predicted to be most intense at high latitudes. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Climatic variability; Common eider (Somateria mollissima); Offspring survival; Temperature cue; Timing of breeding","altitude; annual variation; arctic environment; breeding population; breeding season; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; environmental cue; female; fitness; global climate; growth rate; hatching; ice cover; ice free corridor; individual variation; laying date; seabird; selection; survival; animal; Arctic; article; Canada; cold climate; ducks and geese; female; ice cover; nesting; oviparity; physiology; population migration; temperature; Animal Migration; Animals; Anseriformes; Arctic Regions; Cold Climate; Female; Ice Cover; Nesting Behavior; Nunavut; Oviparity; Temperature; Canada; East Bay; Nunavut; Southampton Island; Aves; Somateria mollissima",,,,,,"Allard, K.A., Breton, A.R., Gilchrist, H.G., Diamond, A.W., Adult survival of herring gulls breeding in the Canadian Arctic (2006) Waterbirds, 29, pp. 163-168; Arnold, T.W., Rohwer, F.C., Do egg formation costs limit clutch size in waterfowl? a sceptical view (1991) Condor, 93, pp. 1032-1038; Bêty, J., Gauthier, G., Giroux, J.-F., Body condition, migration, and timing of reproduction in snow geese: A test of the condition-dependent model of optimal clutch-size (2003) Am Nat, 162, pp. 110-121; Both, C., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.E., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Bottita, G., Nol, E., Gilchrist, H.G., Effects of experimental manipulation on body condition and incubation behaviour among common eiders: Consequences for reproductive success (2003) Waterbirds, 26, pp. 100-107; Brommer, J.E., Pietiäinen, H., Kolunen, H., Natural selection on individual clutch size-laying date trends in the Ural owl (2003) Evol Ecol Res, 5, pp. 229-237; Brommer, J.E., Rattiste, K., Wilson, A.J., Exploring plasticity in the wild: Laying date-temperature reaction norms in the common gull Larus canus (2008) Proc R Soc Lond B, 275, pp. 687-693; Bustnes, J.O., Erikstad, K.E., The role of failed nesters and brood abandoning females in the creching system of the common eider Somateria mollissima (1991) Ornis Scand, 22, pp. 335-339; Charmantier, A., McCleery, R.H., Cole, L.R., Perrins, C., Kruuk, L.E.B., Sheldon, B.C., Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to climate change in a wild bird population (2008) Science, 320, pp. 800-803; Christensen, T.K., Effects of cohort and individual variation in duckling body condition on survival and recruitment in the common eider Somateria mollissima (1999) J Avian Biol, 30, pp. 302-308; D'Alba, L., Monaghan, P., Nager, R.G., Advances in laying date and increasing population size suggest positive responses to climate change in common eiders Somateria mollissima in Iceland (2010) Ibis, 152, pp. 19-28; Descamps, S., Gilchrist, H.G., Bêty, J., Buttler, E.I., Forbes, M.R., Costs of reproduction in a long-lived bird: Large clutch size is associated with low survival in the presence of a highly virulent disease (2009) Biol Lett, 5, pp. 278-281; Dickey, M.H., Gauthier, G., Cadieux, M.-C., Climatic effects on the breeding phenology and reproductive success of an Arctic-nesting goose species (2008) Glob Chang Biol, 14, pp. 1973-1985; Erikstad, K.E., Bustnes, J.O., Moum, T., Clutch-size determination in precocial birds: A study of the common eider (1993) Auk, 110, pp. 623-628; Findlay, C.S., Cooke, F., Synchrony in the lesser snow goose (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) II: The adaptive value of reproductive synchrony (1982) Evolution, 36, pp. 786-799; Garant, D., Kruuk, L.E.B., McCleery, R.H., Sheldon, B.C., The effects of environmental heterogeneity on multivariate selection on reproductive traits in female great tits (2007) Evolution, 61, pp. 1546-1559; Gaston, A.J., Gilchrist, H.G., Hipfner, J.M., Climate change, ice conditions and reproduction in an Arctic nesting marine bird, Brunnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia) (2005) J Anim Ecol, 74, pp. 832-841; Gaston, A.J., Gilchrist, H.G., Mallory, M.L., Variation in ice conditions has strong effects on the breeding of marine birds at Prince Leopold Island, Nunavut (2005) Ecography, 28, pp. 331-344; Gaston, A.J., Gilchrist, H.G., Mallory, M., Smith, P.A., Changes in seasonal events, peak food availability, and consequent breeding adjustment in a marine bird: A case of progressive mismatching (2009) Condor, 111, pp. 111-119; Gauthier, G., Bêty, J., Hobson, K., Are greater snow geese capital breeders? new evidence from a stable isotope model (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 3250-3264; Goudie, I.R., Robertson, G.J., Reed, A., Common eider (Somateria mollissima) (2000) The Birds of North America, 546. , A.
