Simulated carbon budgets indicated a hemispheric release of 1.4 Pg C during burning and 4.1 Pg C gross from CO2 fluxes postfire. The total release (5.5 Pg C) was 43% of the biospheric CO2 release to the atmosphere, 1977-1990. Over the next century (1991-2090), continuing emissions from wood and soil decomposition will release an additional 6.9 Pg C gross. A simulation experiment indicated that the CO2 pulse from direct emissions per unit area was 10-fold larger in tropical deforestation than in northern forest wildfires on average; postfire release in the northern systems, however, was about 10 times longer in duration and only slighlty less overall than in tropical deforestation fires. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide source; deforestation; forest; northern latitudes; wildfire",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027844514
