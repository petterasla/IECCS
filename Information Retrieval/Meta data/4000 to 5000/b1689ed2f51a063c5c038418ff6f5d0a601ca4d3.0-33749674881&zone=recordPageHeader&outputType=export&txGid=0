The paleoclimate modeling has to be evaluated by regionally geological data in order to determine if it is able to reproduce a reality of climate states. Geological evidence shows that there was a warm-wet interstadial at 35000±3000 a BP in China, which provides an important climate period to be historical analogue for the future climate changes induced by greenhouse gas emissions. Integrated geological records of later phase of the MSI3 from China also provide basements for evaluation of 35 ka BP climate modeling. This paper reports the paleoclimate experiments applied by various forces, and validates the outputs by geological data, consequently improving the boundary conditions in the experiments and making the palcoclimates more approach the reality. The simulations show an increased temperature in the mid-low latitudes and an extended rain-belt northwards in East Asia, while a decreased temperature in high latitudes and a strong exchange of the N-S atmospheric circulation. As there is only ca. 10-15 ka from 35 ka BP to the LGM (21 ka BP) during which climate rapidly changed from a warm-wet interstadial to a typical ice age, this simulation provides scientific basis to recognize the criteria of global warming and trends of natural climate development.","East Asia; Geological data validation; Low-latitude temperature increase; Paleoclimate simulation; Precipitation belt expending northwards",,,,,,,"Shi, Y.F., Shen, Y.P., Hu, R.J., Signal of climats change into warm-wet conditions, impacts and predictions for the northwestern China (2002) Glaciology and Geocryology (In Chinese), 24 (3), pp. 219-226; Shi, Y.F., Kong, Z.C., Wang, S.M., Mid-Holocene climates and environments in China (1993) Global and Planetary Change, 7, pp. 219-233; Shi, Y.F., Yu, G., Liu, X.D., Reconstruction for 30-40 ka BP enhanced Indian monsoon based on geological records from the Tibetan Plateau (2001) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 169, pp. 69-83; Li, B.Y., The last greatest lakes on the Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau (2000) Acta Geographica Sinica (In Chinese), 35 (2), pp. 174-182; Zhao, X.T., Zhu, D.G., Wu, Z.H., Lake evolution of Namucuo Lake since the Late Pleistocene (2002) Acta Geosciencia Sinica (In Chinese), 23 (4), pp. 329-334; Zheng, M.P., Liu, J.Y., Qi, W., Palaeoclimatic evolution of the Ti-betan Plateau since 40 ka BP - Evidences from saline lake deposits (1996) Saline Lake Resources and Environments with Its Relative Global Change, pp. 6-20. , (ed.
