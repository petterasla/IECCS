The approach is based on a semi-empirical downscaling of simulated daily atmospheric Circulation Patterns (CP) of General Circulation Models (GCM). Historical data and a 10-year outputs of the Max Planck Institute GCM for the 1 × CO2 and 2 × CO2 cases are used. Nine CP types for the winter and summer half years are obtained to characterize large-scale climatic forcing in Greece, Local temperature and precipitation appear to be highly dependent on CP types. The space-time response of daily temperature to global climate change is slightly variable in Greece. In general, a warmer climate will imply nearly 3°C increase in fall and in winter. The variability within the month will not change considerably. A slight but statistically significant increase of precipitation is obtained at one location and an insignificant increase is found at the other three locations. © 1995.",,,,,,,,"Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, Climate Change, the IPCC Scientific Assessment (1990) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Tegart, Sheldon, Sheldon, (1993) The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Impacts Assessments, , Australian Gov.
