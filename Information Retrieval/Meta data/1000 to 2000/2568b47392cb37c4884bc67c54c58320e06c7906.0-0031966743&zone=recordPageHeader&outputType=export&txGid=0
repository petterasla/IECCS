We compare foliar carbon isotope discrimination (Δ), instantaneous water use efficiency, total foliar nitrogen concentration, and specific leaf area (for a subset of sites) between Larix spp. and co-occurring evergreen conifers at 20 sites throughout the natural range of larches. Except for Larix occidentalis in the xeric Intermountain West, USA, Δ is significantly (P < 0.05) greater for larches than co-occurring evergreen conifers at 77% of the sites, suggesting that larches use water less efficiently. At elevations greater than 3000 m, the Δ of Larix spp. and co-occurring conifers converge, suggesting that water is not the limiting resource. Foliar nitrogen concentration and specific leaf area are two ecophysiological characteristics that are positively correlated with high photosynthetic capacity. Foliar nitrogen concentration is significantly greater for latches than evergreen conifers at 88% of the sites and specific leaf area is approximately three times greater for latches than co-occurring conifers. Future studies should examine the potential effect that global warming may have on the distribution of larch forests because the water use efficiency of larches is commonly less than co-occurring evergreen conifers and the boreal and high-latitude environments are likely to experience the greatest climate warming.","δ13 Carbon; Foliar nitrogen; Needle age; Specific leaf area; Water use efficiency","carbon isotope; coniferous tree; leaf area; leaf nutrient; nitrogen; water use efficiency; Larix; Larix occidentalis",,,,,,"Arno, S.F., Habeck, J.R., Ecology of alpine larch (Larix lyalli Parl.) in the Pacific Northwest (1972) Ecol Monogr, 42, pp. 417-450; Axelrod, D.I., Origin of deciduous and evergreen habits in temperate forests (1966) Evolution, 20, pp. 1-15; Bloom, A.J., Chapin, F.S., Mooney, H.A., Resource limitation in plants - An economic analogy (1985) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 16, pp. 363-392; Boutton, T.W., Stable carbon isotope ratios of natural materials.
