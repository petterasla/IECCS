Yearly population responses of the three insect species on a per-tree basis for up to 10 years at two orange groves were analyzed by general linear models, with a backward stepwise procedure, to select among abiotic (summer/winter temperature and rainfall) and biotic (densities of the three insect species and orange bearing in the previous years) independent variables. Temperature positively affected the arrowhead scale and the two parasitoids. A negative correlation of rainfall was detected for all three insect species. Mandarin fruiting showed negative delayed density dependence, thereby supporting the observed alternate bearing phenomenon in mandarins, presumably due to physiological imbalance triggered by climatic factors. The arrowhead scale was negatively correlated with fruit production in the preceding years, possibly due to reduced resistance in subsequent years of mast fruiting. We found a negative correlation of the arrowhead scale with Coccobius only in a single grove and none with Aphytis. Thus, it appears that bottom-up forces may be more important than top-down control by the parasitoids in the post-transient phase of this system. © The Society of Population Ecology and Springer-Verlag 2005.","Diaspididae; Endogenous versus exogenous factors; Global warming; Host-density dependence in parasitism; Spatial heterogeneity; Time series data","biological control; climate variation; host-parasitoid interaction; population dynamics; trophic interaction; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Alismataceae; Aphytis; Aphytis yanonensis; Citrus reticulata; Citrus unshiu; Coccobius; Coccobius fulvus; Diaspididae; Insecta; Unaspis yanonensis",,,,,,"Andrewartha, H.G., Birch, L.C., Measurement of environmental resistance in the Australian plague grasshopper (1948) Nature, 161, pp. 447-448; Bale, J.S., Harrington, R.L., Clough, M.S., Low temperature mortality of the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae (1988) Ecol Entomol, 13, pp. 121-129; Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Awmack, C., Herbivory in global climate change research: Direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Glob Change Biol, 8, pp. 1-16; Davis, A.J., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Jenkinson, L.S., Individualistic species responses invalidate simple physiological models of community dynamics under global environmental change (1998) J Anim Ecol, 67, pp. 600-612; DeBach, P., The role of weather and entomophagous species in the natural control of insect populations (1958) J Econ Entomol, 51, pp. 474-484; Fox, J.W., Morin, P.J., Effects of intra- and interspecific interactions on species responses to environmental change (2001) J Anim Ecol, 70, pp. 80-90; Furuhashi, K., Nishino, M., Biological control of arrowhead scale, Unaspis yanonensis, by parasitic wasps introduced from the Peoples Republic of China (1983) Entomophaga, 28, pp. 277-286; Furuhashi, K., Ohkubo, N., Use of parasitic wasps to control the arrowhead scale (Hom., Diaspidae), in Japan (1990) FFTC Book Series, 40, pp. 71-81; Hashimoto, S., Miyaji, K., Gyoutoku, Y., Watanabe, Y., Kai, I., Tamura, I., Ujiye, T., Kashio, T., Dispersion of Aphytis yanonensis and Coccobius fulvus, introduced parasitoids of arrowhead scale, Unaspis yanonensis in Kyushu in 1987.
