Location: Ascension Island, tropical south Atlantic. Main conclusions: The cloud forest on Green Mountain is a man-made system that has produced a tropical forest without any coevolution between its constituent species. This has implications for the way we think about ecosystems and provides a striking example of Janzen's idea of 'ecological fitting'. This system provides ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, and illustrates the possible role of man-made ecosystems in the mitigation of global warming.","Ascension Island; Darwin; Ecological fitting; Ecosystem; Global change; Greenhouse effect; Hooker; Terraforming","cloud forest; global change; greenhouse effect; human activity; Ascension Island; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Green Mountain",,,,,,"Ashmole, N.P., Ashmole, M.J., The land fauna of Ascension Island: New data from cave and lava flows, and a reconstruction of the prehistoric ecosystem (1997) Journal of Biogeography, 24, pp. 549-589; Ashmole, P., Ashmole, M., (2000) St Helena and Ascension Island: A Natural History, , Anthony Nelson, Oswestry; Beerling, D.J., Lomax, B.H., Upchurch, G.R., Nichols, D.J., Pillmore, C.L., Handley, L.L., Scrimgeour, C.M., Evidence for the recovery of terrestrial ecosystem ahead of marine primary production following a biotic crisis at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (2001) Journal of the Geological Society, 158, pp. 737-740; Betts, R.A., Self-beneficial effects of vegetation on climate in an Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model (1999) Geophysical Research Letters, 26, pp. 1457-1460; Bush, M.B., Colinvaux, P.A., Tropical forest disturbance: Paleoecological records from Darien, Panama (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 1761-1768; Cronk, Q.C.B., Extinction and survival in the endemic vascular flora of Ascension Island (1980) Biological Conservation, 17, pp. 207-219; Darwin, C., (1839) Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the Various Countries Visited by H.M.S.
