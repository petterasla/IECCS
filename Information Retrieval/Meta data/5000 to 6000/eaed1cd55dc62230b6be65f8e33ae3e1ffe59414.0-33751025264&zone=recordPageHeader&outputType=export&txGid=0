We discuss the factors controlling soil respiration, while focusing on research conducted at the Takayama Experimental Site. Soil respiration was affected by soil temperature, soil moisture, rainfall events, typhoons, and root respiration. We consider the temporal and spatial variability of soil respiration at the Takayama Experimental Site and review the variability of annual soil respiration in Japanese forests. In the 26 compiled studies, the values of annual soil respiration ranged from 203 to 1,290 g C m-2 year-1, with a mean value of 669 g C m-2 year-1 (SD=264, CV=40). We note the need for more studies and data synthesis for the accurate prediction of soil respiration and soil carbon dynamics in Japanese forests. Finally, several methods for measuring soil respiration rates are compared and the implications of soil respiration rates for global climate change are discussed. © 2006 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Annual soil respiration; Rainfall event; Soil moisture; Soil temperature; Takayama Experimental Site; Typhoon","carbon flux; forest ecosystem; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; spatial variation; temporal variation; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan",,,,,,"Baldocchi, D., Environmental science: The carbon cycle under stress (2005) Nature, 437 (7058), pp. 483-484; Baldocchi, D., Black, T.A., Curtis, P.S., Falge, E., Fuentes, J.D., Granier, A., Gu, L., Yamamoto, S., Predicting the onset of net carbon uptake by deciduous forests with soil temperature and climate data: A synthesis of FLUXNET data (2005) Int J Biometeorol, 49 (6), pp. 377-387; Bowden, R.D., Boone, R.D., Melillo, J.M., Garrison, J.B., Contributions of aboveground litter, belowground litter, and root respiration to total soil respiration in a temperate mixed hardwood forest (1993) Can J For Res, 23 (7), pp. 1402-1407; Chiba, K., Tsutsumi, T., A study on the soil respiration of forests. 1.
