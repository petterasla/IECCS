During both events, fatalities occurred high on the mountain during deteriorating weather conditions. Although there have been dramatic improvements in knowledge of the mountain and in the technology used on it, it is shown that an unappreciated change that has also occurred, as a result of warming in the region, is an increase in barometric pressure. Arare and unique set of meteorological data collected at various elevations on the mountain during the 1924 British Everest expedition as well as modern datasets are used to compare and contrast conditions during the two storms and the two climbing seasons. It is shown that both storms were associated with weather systems known locally as western disturbances that resulted in summit barometric pressure drops sufficient to have exacerbated altitudeinduced hypoxia. It is further shown that the Mallory and Irvine attempt occurred later in the season than typically is the case nowand that this was most likely the result of a concurrentEl Niño event. Despite the trend of increasing barometric pressure, the pressure drop associated with storms in the region should remain a concern for those who venture to extreme altitudes. The authors therefore argue that success and failure on Everest and other Himalayan peaks requires knowledge of the variability and trends in both the weather and climate. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; ENSO; History; Monsoons; Mountain meteorology; Storm environments","Barometric pressure; Data sets; ENSO; Historical trends; Meteorological data; Monsoons; Mount Everest; Thin air; Twentieth century; Weather conditions; Weather systems; Atmospheric pressure; Barometers; Climate change; Global warming; History; Landforms; Nickel compounds; Pressure drop; Storms; barometry; climate change; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; historical perspective; hypoxia; meteorology; monsoon; mountain environment; pressure drop; storm; twentieth century; Himalayas; Khumbu Himal; Mount Everest",,,,,,"Anker, C., Roberts, D., (1999) The Lost Explorer: Finding Mallory on Mount Everest, p. 191. , Simon and Schuster; Ashok, K., Yamagata, T., Climate change: The El Niño with a difference (2009) Nature, 461, pp. 481-484; Bengtsson, L., Hodges, K.I., On the evaluation of temperature trends in the tropical troposphere (2011) Climate Dyn., 36, pp. 419-430; Bengtsson, L., Hagemann, S., Hodges, K.I., Can climate trends be calculated from reanalysis data?
