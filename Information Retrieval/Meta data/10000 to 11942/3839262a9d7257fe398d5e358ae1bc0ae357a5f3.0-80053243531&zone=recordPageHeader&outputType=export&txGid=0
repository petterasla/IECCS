As air temperature increases with global climate change, the character of the generally established seasonal snowcover will be affected. To study the specific response to variable climate, a carefully collected and processed meteorological data set for the 1984-2008 water years (WYs) was assembled for a snow-dominated headwater mountain catchment. The data were used to force a physically based, distributed energy balance snow model to simulate patterns of snow deposition and melt over the catchment for the 25-year period. This period covers both the highest (1984) and lowest (1992) snow seasons on record and exhibits extreme inter-annual variability. This unique forcing data set captured meteorological conditions that resulted in the range of variability in snowcover accumulation, timing of ablation, and the timing and amount of surface water input (SWI), and discharge during the 25-year study period. SWI is the amount of liquid water delivered to the soil surface from melting snow or from rain that passes through the snowcover or falls directly on the soil. Warm winters, characterized by early- and mid-winter rain, triggered earlier inputs from SWI and response in discharge than cool winters. Cool conditions prolonged the generation of SWI and streamflow out of the basin. Very wet conditions that were warm passed 50% of the SWI 27 days earlier and passed 50% of the discharge 15 days earlier, when compared to very wet conditions that were cool. Warmer conditions produced less snow water equivalent, shortened the melt season, and would be expected to extend the summer drought. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Climate change; Energy balance model; Snowmelt","Air temperature; Data sets; Distributed energies; Energy balance model; Global climate changes; Head waters; Interannual variability; Liquid water; Meteorological condition; Meteorological data; Mountain basins; Physically based; Snow covers; Snow models; Snow water equivalent; Snowmelt; Soil surfaces; Summer droughts; Warmer conditions; Water year; Wet conditions; Catchments; Energy balance; Meteorology; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Snow; Snow melting systems; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; drought; energetics; energy balance; headwater; mountain environment; snow cover; snow water equivalent; snowmelt; streamflow; North America",,,,,,"Bewley, D., Pomeroy, J., Essery, R., Solar radiation transfer through a sub-arctic shrub canopy (2007) Arctic, Antarctic and Alpine Research, 39 (3), pp. 365-374; Cayan, D., Kammerdiener, S., Dettinger, M., Caprio, J., Peterson, D., Changes in the onset of spring in the Western United States (2001) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 82 (3), pp. 399-415; Essery, R., Bunting, P., Hardy, J., Link, T., Marks, D., Melloh, R., Pomeroy, J., Rutter, N., Radiative transfer modeling of a coniferous canopy characterized by airborne remote sensing (2008) Journal of Hydrometeorology, 9 (2), pp. 228-241; Flerchinger, G., Marks, D., Seyfried, M., Pierson, F.P., Nayak, A., Hardegree, S.P., Winstral, A.H., Clark, P.E., 45 Years of climate and hydrologic research conducted at Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (2007) Environmental and Water Resources: Milestones in Engineering History, pp. 135-143. , ASCE Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) National History & Heritage Committee, Rogers JR (eds); American Society of Civil Engineers: Reston, VA, USA; -; Garen, D., Marks, D., Spatially distributed energy balance snowmelt modelling in a mountainous river basin: estimation of meteorological inputs and verification of model results (2005) Journal of Hydrology, 315, pp. 126-153; Green, I.R.A., Stephenson, D., Criteria for comparison of single event models (1986) Hydrological Sciences Journal, 31 (3), pp. 395-411; Hanson, C., Long-term precipitation database, Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho, USA (2001) Water Resources Research, 37 (11), pp. 2831-2834; Hardy, J.P., Melloh, R., Koenig, G., Marks, D., Winstral, A., Pomeroy, J., Link, T., Solar radiation transmission through conifer canopies (2004) Journal of Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 126, pp. 257-270; Contributions of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, p. 989. , IPCC..
