Amateurs may lack a complete understanding of recommended strategies for handling heat and humidity, making heat-related illnesses increasingly possible. This is compounded by global climate change and increasing average surface and air temperatures, especially in urban areas of industrialized nations in Europe and North America that have hosted most events to date. We conducted an on-line, secure survey at the 2nd Annual ING Georgia Marathon and Half-Marathon in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2008. We included previously validated questions on participant socio-demographics, training locations, and knowledge and awareness of heat-related illnesses. Participants were aware of heat illnesses, and of heat stroke as a serious form of heat stress. However, the majority, across age and gender, did not understand the potential severity of heat stroke. Furthermore, 1-in-5 participants did not understand the concept of heat stress as a form of heat-related illness, and how heat stress may result from buildup of muscle-generated heat in the body. Adult recreational endurance athletes are another susceptible, vulnerable population sub-group for applied research and public health educational interventions, especially in urban areas of industrialized nations in Europe and North America. © 2010 ISB.","Endurance sports; Heat stress; Heat stroke; Recreational athletes; Urban health","adolescent; adult; aged; article; athlete; attitude to health; endurance; female; health; heat; heat injury; human; male; middle aged; psychological aspect; questionnaire; sport; United States; athlete; Georgia; heat; Heat Stress Disorders; psychology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Athletes; Female; Georgia; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Heat Stress Disorders; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Endurance; Questionnaires; Sports; Urban Health; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Athletes; Female; Georgia; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Heat Stress Disorders; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Endurance; Questionnaires; Sports; Urban Health; Young Adult",,,,,,"Davis, R.E., Knappenberger, P.C., Michaels, P.J., Novicoff, W.M., Changing heat-related mortality in the United States (2003) Environ Health Perspect, 111 (14), pp. 1712-1718; Donaldson, G.C., Keatinge, W.R., Näyhä, S., Changes in summer temperature and heat-related mortality since 1971 in North Carolina, South Finland, and Southeast England (2003) Environ Res, 91 (1), pp. 1-7; Ebi, K.L., Exuzides, K.A., Lau, E., Kelsh, M., Barnston, A., Weather changes associated with hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases and stroke in California, 1983-1998 (2004) Int J Biometeorol, 49 (1), pp. 48-58; Ebi, K.L., Mills, D.M., Smith, J.B., Grambsch, A., Climate change and human health impacts in the United States: An update on the results of the U.S. national assessment (2006) Environ Health Perspect, 114 (9), pp. 1318-1324; Ellis, F.P., Heat illness.
