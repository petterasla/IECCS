Methods: Mortality rates and emergency ambulance interventions rates were compared with records from the previous years. We considered the whole population, aged 65 and over, as well as 75 and over. Results: The 2003 mortality in the population was not significantly different from the previous years. The number of deaths among the elderly showed a small but significant deviation from the expected values during the first heat wave in June 2003, with no significant impact on the seasonal results. The number of ambulance service interventions was larger than during the previous years. Conclusion: These results are consistent with findings in other studies. The heat waves (especially in June), were correlated with a higher number of ambulance callouts. In addition to some geographic, climatic, and social factors that had a protective impact, the response of the emergency services is likely to have contributed to a certain reduction in mortality. © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel 2006.","Ambulance services; Elderly people; Heat; Mortality; Switzerland; Ticino","aged; ambulance; article; correlation analysis; demography; elderly care; emergency care; emergency health service; environmental change; health care need; heat intolerance; heat stroke; human; mortality; Poisson distribution; population research; risk reduction; seasonal variation; social aspect; summer; Switzerland; temperature measurement; temperature related phenomena; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulances; Cause of Death; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Humans; Infrared Rays; Male; Mortality; Population Surveillance; Reference Values; Seasons; Switzerland; Temperature; Utilization Review",,,,,,"Alderson, M.R., Season and mortality (1985) Health Trends, 17, pp. 87-96; Basu, R., Samet, J.M., Relation between Elevated Temperature and Mortality: A Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence (2002) Epidemiol Rev, 24, pp. 190-202; Besancenot, J.P., Vagues de chaleur et mortalit dans les grandes agglomrations urbaines (2002) Environnement Risques Et Santé, 1, pp. 229-240; Impact of heat waves on Mortality - Rome, Italy, June-August 2003 (2004) JAMA, 291, pp. 2537-2538. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Conn, J.W., Johnston, M.W., Louis, L.H., Acclimatization to humid heat (a function of adrenal cortical activity) (1946) J Clin Invest, 25, pp. 912-913; Conti, S., Masocco, M., Meli, P., Minelli, G., Solimini, R., Toccaceli, V., Vichi, M., (2004) Indagine Epidemiologica Rapida Sulla Mortalità Estiva 2004: Rapporto Fi Nale, Riguardante Il Trimestre Dell'Estate Metereologica 2004 (giugno, Luglio Ed Agosto), , Roma: Uffi cio di Statistica dell'Istituto Superiore della Sanità; Curriero, F.C., Heiner, K.S., Samet, J.M., Zeger, S.L., Strug, L., Patz, J.A., Temperature and Mortality in 11 cities of the Eastern United States (2002) Am J Epidemiol, 155, pp. 80-87; Grize, L., Anke, H., Thommen, O., Schindler, C., Braun-Fahrländer C Heat wave 2003 and mortality in Switzerland (2005) Swiss Med Wkly, 135, pp. 200-205; Hamming, R.W., (1973) Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers, , (2nd ed.).
