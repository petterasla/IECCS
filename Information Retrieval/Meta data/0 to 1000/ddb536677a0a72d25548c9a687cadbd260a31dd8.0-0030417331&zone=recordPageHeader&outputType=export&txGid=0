We established a study to monitor the density and reproductive effort of six such species in tundra of Glacier National Park, Montana to help project the fate of these species in the center of their range. For many species, detecting long-term population trends is confounded by short-term variation. Our study design employs temporal resampling of permanent plots on multiple sites and a repeated-measures model that accommodates the effects of high frequency variation and allows assessment of the significance of long-term trends. Statistical analysis compares site-specific estimates of annual mean density between two time periods and uses betweenplot, within-site, within-year variation to estimate error. Power calculations using data from the 3-yr baseline period indicate that measurements of fecundity will be less sensitive for detecting long-term trends than measurements of plant density. Furthermore, our results suggest that perennial species of closed-turf communities may be better bioassays of long-term change than annuals or species of open, ephemeral microsites.","Alpine tundra; Climate change; Glacier National Park; Plant monitoring; Rare plants; Repeated measures; Statistical power","climatic change; monitoring; population trend; rare plant; USA, Montana, Glacier National Park",,,,,,"Agren, G.I., McMurtrie, R.E., Parton, W.J., Pastor, J., Shugart, H.H., State-of-the-art models of production-decomposition linkages in conifer and grassland ecosystems (1991) Ecological Applications, 1, pp. 118-138; Alt, D., Hyndman, D.W., (1986) Roadside Geology of Montana, , Mountain Press, Missoula, Montana, USA; Anderson, J.M., The effects of climate change on decomposition processes in grassland and coniferous forests (1991) Ecological Applications, 1, pp. 326-347; (1992) GAUSS, , Maple Valley, Washington, USA; Bazzaz, F.A., The response of natural ecosystems to the rising global CO2 levels (1990) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 21, pp. 167-196; Billings, W.D., Mooney, H.A., The ecology of arctic and alpine plants (1968) Biological Reviews, 43, pp. 481-529; Bowles, M.L., Hess, W.J., DeMauro, M.M., Hiebert, R.D., Endangered plant inventory and monitoring strategies at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (1986) Natural Areas Journal, 6, pp. 18-26; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., (1976) Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA; Brillinger, D.R., Trend analysis: Time series and point process problems (1994) Environmetrics, 5, pp. 1-19; Cain, S.A., (1944) Foundations of Plant Geography, , Harper & Row, New York, New York, USA; Carpenter, S.R., Frost, T.M., Kitchell, J.F., Kratz, T.K., Species dynamics and global environmental change: A perspective from ecosystem experiments (1993) Biotic Interactions and Global Change, pp. 267-279. , P.
