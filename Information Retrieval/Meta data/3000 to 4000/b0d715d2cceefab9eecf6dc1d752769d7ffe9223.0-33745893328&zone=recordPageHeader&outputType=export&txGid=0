Natural climate fluctuations, global warming, and the growing needs of water consumers demand intelligent management of this water resource. This requires a comprehensive monitoring system across and within the Sierra Nevada. Unfortunately, because of severe terrain and limited access, few measurements exist. Thus, meteorological and hydrologic processes are not well understood at high altitudes. However, new sensor and wireless communication technologies are beginning to provide sensor packages designed for low maintenance operation, low power consumption and unobtrusive footprints. A prototype network of meteorological and hydrological sensors has been deployed in Yosemite National Park, traversing elevation zones from 1,200 to 3,700 m. Communication techniques must be tailored to suit each location, resulting in a hybrid network of radio, cell-phone, land-line, and satellite transmissions. Results are showing how, in some years, snowmelt may occur quite uniformly over the Sierra, while in others it varies with elevation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,"Global warming; Mobile phones; Radio transmission; Sensor networks; Snow melting systems; Water resources; Water supply; Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication techniques; Comprehensive monitoring; Intelligent management; Low-power consumption; Satellite transmission; Sensor network applications; Wireless communication technology; Yosemite National Park; Forestry",,,,,,"Cayan, D.R., Kammerdiener, S.A., Dettinger, M.D., Caprio, J.M., Peterson, D.H., Changes in the onset of spring in the Western United States (2001) Bull.
