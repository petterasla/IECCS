D., STA Suyoshi, Nagaoka 940, Japan","Reduced amounts of snow in the eight winters from 1986-87 to 1993-94 at Nagaoka, Japan, seem to be due to a winter air-temperature rise. The winter air temperature has shown a cyclic variation with a gradual increase in the past 100 years. The linear rate of the temperature rise in the past century was calculated as 1.35 °C per 100 years. Both the maximum snow depth and winter precipitation showed an inversely positive correlation with winter mean air temperature. The square of the statistical correlation coefficient r2 was calculated as 0.321 and 0.107, respectively. Statistically smoothed curves of the maximum snow depth and winter precipitation showed maximum values in 1940. Fluctuations in deviation of the maximum snow depth showed smaller values than in precipitation. The minimum winter mean air temperature obtained from a 10 year moving average curve was found in 1942, and the deviation from the climatic mean changed from negative to positive in 1949. The change in sign of the temperature deviation and the increase of the deviation may be attributable to global warming.",,"global warning; snowfall reduction; winter air temperature; winter precipitation; Japan, Honshu, Hokuriki, Nagaoka",,,,,,"Barry, R.G., Goodison, B.E., LeDrew, E.F., Snow Watch '92.
