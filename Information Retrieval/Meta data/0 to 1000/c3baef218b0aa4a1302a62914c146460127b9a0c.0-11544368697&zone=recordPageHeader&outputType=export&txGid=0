An intensity distribution is defined as the cumulative sum of the function along the abscissa. These functions are examined first for a normal distribution, and then for the expected deviations shown by a sample assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. The theoretical maximum of the intensity is found at one standard deviation for the normal distribution and at √2 s.d. (standard deviation) for a sample drawn from a normal distribution. The cumulative sum of the intensity is more biased towards outlying values of larger magnitude for the sample than for the normal distribution. 10% of the cumulative sum of the intensities is generated at s.d. greater than 3 for the sample compared to only 1% for the normal distribution itself. These statistics are compared with similar ones computed for the Jones-Parker (1991) series of mean global surface temperature anomaly interannual differences. The agreement between theory and the data series is good. The data series appears to possess those properties which would be expected of it if the series was a sample drawn from a normal distribution. It is concluded that the work intensity and its cumulative sum are useful tools in diagnosing the behaviour of a population of anomaly values. These statistics do not clarify the problem of identifying a greenhouse gas induced global warming but they do suggest that its identification continues to be as difficult as ever, due to the effect of occasional outlying values. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,"Anya, M., Contemporary erosion rate by landsliding in Amahata River Basin, Japan (1985) Zeitschrift für Geomorphologie, 29, pp. 310-314; Bardsley, W.E., Khatep, M.M., Estimating workmagnitude associations in earth surface processes (1991) Mathematical Geology, 23, pp. 591-608; Feller, W., (1960) An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications, Vol. 1, , John Wiley, New York; Galambos, J., (1978) The Asymptotic Theory of Extreme Order Statistics, , John Wiley, New York; Gordon, A.H., The normal distribution and the interannual variability of the global surface temperature record (1991) Meteor.
