For fuels to be useful in the transportation sector, they must have specific physical properties that allow for efficient distribution, storage and combustion; these properties are currently fulfilled by non-renewable petroleum-derived liquid fuels. Ethanol, the only renewable liquid fuel currently produced in large quantities, suffers from several limitations, including low energy density, high volatility, and contamination by the absorption of water from the atmosphere. Here we present a catalytic strategy for the production of 2,5-dimethylfuran from fructose (a carbohydrate obtained directly from biomass or by the isomerization of glucose) for use as a liquid transportation fuel. Compared to ethanol, 2,5-dimethylfuran has a higher energy density (by 40 per cent), a higher boiling point (by 20 K), and is not soluble in water. This catalytic strategy creates a route for transforming abundant renewable biomass resources into a liquid fuel suitable for the transportation sector, and may diminish our reliance on petroleum. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"2,5 dimethylfuran; alcohol; biofuel; carbohydrate; fructose; furan derivative; unclassified drug; biofuel; biomass; carbohydrate; catalysis; ethanol; fuel; renewable resource; article; biofuel production; biomass; chemical analysis; combustion; greenhouse effect; materials testing; petrochemical industry; priority journal",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; fructose, 30237-26-4, 57-48-7, 7660-25-5, 77907-44-9",,,,"Parikka, M., Global biomass fuel resources (2004) Biomass Bioenergy, 27, pp. 613-620; Ragauskas, A.J., The path forward for biofuels and biomaterials (2006) Science, 311, pp. 484-489; Barlow, M.T., Smith, D.J., Steward, D.G., Fuel composition (1983), European patent EP0082689Román-Leshkov, Y., Chheda, J.N., Dumesic, J.A., Phase modifiers promote efficient production of hydroxymethylfurfural from fructose (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1933-1937; Brown, D.W., Floyd, A.J., Kinsman, R.G., Roshan-Ali, Y., Dehydration reactions of fructose in non-aqueous media (1982) J.
