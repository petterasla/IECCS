The endemic shelf fauna of Antarctica is especially vulnerable to climate-mediated biological invasions because cold temperatures currently exclude the durophagous (shell-breaking) predators that structure shallow-benthic communities elsewhere. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used the Eocene fossil record from Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula, to project specifically how global warming will reorganize the nearshore benthos of Antarctica. A long-term cooling trend, which began with a sharp temperature drop ∼41 Ma (million years ago), eliminated durophagous predators - teleosts (modern bony fish), decapod crustaceans (crabs and lobsters) and almost all neoselachian elasmobranchs (modern sharks and rays) - from Antarctic nearshore waters after the Eocene. Even prior to those extinctions, durophagous predators became less active as coastal sea temperatures declined from 41 Ma to the end of the Eocene, ∼33.5 Ma. In response, dense populations of suspension-feeding ophiuroids and crinoids abruptly appeared. Dense aggregations of brachiopods transcended the cooling event with no apparent change in predation pressure, nor were there changes in the frequency of shell-drilling predation on venerid bivalves. Conclusions/Significance: Rapid warming in the Southern Ocean is now removing the physiological barriers to shell-breaking predators, and crabs are returning to the Antarctic Peninsula. Over the coming decades to centuries, we predict a rapid reversal of the Eocene trends. Increasing predation will reduce or eliminate extant dense populations of suspension-feeding echinoderms from nearshore habitats along the Peninsula while brachiopods will continue to form large populations, and the intensity of shell-drilling predation on infaunal bivalves will not change appreciably. In time the ecological effects of global warming could spread to other portions of the Antarctic coast. The differential responses of faunal components will reduce the endemic character of Antarctic subtidal communities, homogenizing them with nearshore communities at lower latitudes. © 2009 Aronson et al.",,"Antarctica; article; benthic fauna; climate change; controlled study; cooling; Crustacea; echinoderm; ecological specialization; Elasmobranchii; Eocene; extinct species; fossil; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; species habitat; teleost; temperature measurement; trend study; Bivalvia; Brachiopoda; Chondrichthyes; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Echinodermata; Elasmobranchii; lobster; Ophiuroidea; Osteichthyes; Pelmatozoa; Teleostei; Veneroida",,,,,,"Barnes, D.K.A., Peck, L.S., Vulnerability of Antarctic shelf biodiversity to predicted regional warming (2008) Clim Res, 37, pp. 149-163; Aronson, R.B., Thatje, S., Clarke, A., Peck, L.S., Blake, D.B., Climate change and invasibility of the Antarctic benthos (2007) Ann Rev Ecol Evol Syst, 38, pp. 129-154; Vermeij, G.J., Roopnarine, P.D., The coming Arctic invasion (2008) Science, 321, pp. 780-781; Thatje, S., Anger, K., Calcagno, J.A., Lovrich, G.A., Pörtner, H.-O., Challenging the cold: Crabs reconquer the Antarctic (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 619-625; Dayton, P.K., Robilliard, G.A., Paine, R.T., Dayton, L.B., Biological accommodation in the benthic community at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica (1974) Ecol Monogr, 44, pp. 105-128; Clarke, A., Aronson, R.B., Crame, J.A., Gili, J.-M., Blake, D.B., Evolution and diversity of the benthic fauna of the Southern Ocean continental shelf (2004) Antarct Sci, 16, pp. 559-568; Gili, J.-M., Arntz, W.E., Palanques, A., Orejas, C., Clarke, A., A unique assemblage of epibenthic sessile suspension feeders with archaic features in the high-Antarctic (2006) Deep-Sea Res II, 53, pp. 1029-1052; Zachos, J., Pagani, M., Sloan, L., Thomas, E., Billups, K., Trends, rhythms, and aberrations in global climate 65 Ma to present (2001) Science, 292, pp. 686-693; Lear, C.H., Bailey, T.R., Pearson, P.N., Coxall, H.K., Rosenthal, Y., Cooling and ice growth across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (2008) Geology, 36, pp. 251-254; Ivany, L.C., Lohmann, K.C., Hasiuk, F., Blake, D.B., Glass, A., Eocene climate record of a high southern latitude continental shelf: Seymour Island, Antarctica (2008) Geol Soc Am Bull, 120, pp. 659-678; Aronson, R.B., Blake, D.B., Oji, T., Retrograde community structure in the late Eocene of Antarctica (1997) Geology, 25, pp. 903-906; Vermeij, G.J., The Mesozoic marine revolution: Evidence from snails, predators and grazers (1977) Paleobiology, 3, pp. 245-258; Harper, E.M., The Mesozoic marine revolution (2003) Predator-prey interactions in the fossil record, pp. 433-455. , Kelley PH, Kowalewski M, Hanson TA, eds, New York: Kluwer/Plenum. pp; Sadler, P.M., Geometry and stratification of uppermost Cretaceous and Paleogene units on Seymour Island, northern Antarctic Penunsula (1988) Geology and paleontology of Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula, 169, pp. 303-320. , Feldmann RM, Woodburne MO, eds, Boulder: Geological Society of America Memoir; Porebski, S.J., Facies architecture in a tectonically-controlled incised-valley estuary: La Meseta Formation (Eocene) of Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula (1995) Stud Geol Polon, 107, pp. 7-97; Marenssi, S.A., Santillana, S.N., Rinaldi, C.A., (1998) Stratigraphy of the La Meseta Formation (Eocene), Marambio (Seymour) Island, 5, pp. 137-146. , Antarctica, Casadío S, ed.
