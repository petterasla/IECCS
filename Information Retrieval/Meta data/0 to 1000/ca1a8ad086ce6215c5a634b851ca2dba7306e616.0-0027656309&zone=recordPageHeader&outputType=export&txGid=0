Thus, it is critical to understand the long-term factors affecting its level, especially the longer-range technological considerations. Most recent analyses of the problem focus on the next 20 to 100 years. While great uncertainties exist in longer-term projections of CO2, it is of concern that the longer-range buildup (over many centuries) may be of substantial magnitude and might be so despite major efforts to reduce use of fossil reserves for energy, save world forests, and/or collect and dispose of CO2. This paper summarizes some of the recent literature relating to the longer-term CO2 problem and discusses some of the technological considerations for known prevention and mitigation approaches in the context of this longer-term problem. These approaches include: renewables (solar photovoltaics, wind, and biomass), conservation, flue-gas and fuel CO2 sequestration via disposal on land or in the ocean, carbon recycling (chemical/biological utilization), and atmospheric CO2 fixation/utilization via terrestrial and marine approaches. These are discussed along with other strategies to identify those that 1) could be major factors in preventing long-term CO2 buildup, 2) would be environmentally sound but likely to have more limited long-range CO2 impact, 3) would be environmentally uncertain or uncertain for other reasons, and 4) would be environmentally questionable or unlikely solutions for other reasons. © 1993.","carbon; Carbon dioxide; global warming; mitigation; prevention; technology","Air pollution control; Atmospheric composition; Climatology; Combustion; Effluent treatment; Fossil fuels; Gaseous effluents; Greenhouse effect; Anthropogenic effects; Carbon dioxide disposal technologies; Climate change; Global carbon dioxide; Global climate; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Arekawa, Methods for recycling use of emitted carbon dioxide: catalytic hydrogenation (1992) Now & Future, 7, pp. 10-12; Borwardt, A technology for reduction of CO2 emissions from the transportation sector (1992) Energy Conversion and Management, 33, pp. 443-449; Brower, (1992) Cool energy: renewable solutions to environmental problems, , Revised Edition, MIT Press; DOE, (1991) National Energy Strategy, , Department of Energy; Emmel, Maibodi, (1990) Retrofit Costs for SO2 and NOx Control Options 200 Coal-Fired Plants, Vol. 1.Introduction and Methodology, EPA-600/7-90-021a (NTIS PB91-133322), , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC; Hangebrauck, Borgwardt, Geron, Carbon Dioxide Sequestration (1992) presented at EPA Symposium on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Mitigation Research, , Washington, D.C., 8/18–20/92; Hoffert, Wey, Callerari, Broecker, Atmospheric response to deep-sea injections of fossil-fuel carbon dioxide (1979) Climatic Change, 2, pp. 53-68; Houghton, Tropical deforestation and atmospheric carbon dioxide (1991) Climatic Change, , In press; ICF Resources, (1990) Preliminary technology cost estimates of measures available to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2010; IPCC, (1992) 1992 IPCC Supplement, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , UNEP/WMO; JCAE (Joint Committee on Atomic Energy), Understanding the national energy dilemma, 93rd Congress (1973) U.S. Government Printing Office stock number 5270-01947; Johnson, Vejtasa, Pelline, Biasca, Simbeck, Dicenson, Screening analysis of CO2 utilization and fixation: Final Report (1992) DOE/FE/61680-H2; Joos, Sarmiento, Siegenthaler, Estimates of the effect of southern ocean iron fertilization on atmospheric CO2 concentrations (1991) Nature, 349, pp. 772-775; Kasting, Walker, The geochemical carbon cycle and the uptake of fossil fuel CO2 (1992) AIP Conference Proceedings 247, Global Warming: Physics and Facts, pp. 175-200. , B.G.
