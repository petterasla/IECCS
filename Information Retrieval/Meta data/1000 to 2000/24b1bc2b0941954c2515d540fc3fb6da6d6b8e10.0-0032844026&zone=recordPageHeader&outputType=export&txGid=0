Plots in open-top chambers (4.5 m diameter) were exposed continuously (24 h) to ambient and elevated CO2 from early April to late October each year. Unchambered plots were monitored also. Aboveground peak biomass was determined by clipping each year in early August, and root growth was estimated by harvesting roots from root ingrowth bags. Plant community composition was censused each year in early June. In the last 2 years of the study, subplots were clipped on 1 June or 1 July, and regrowth was harvested on 1 October. Volumetric soil water content of the 0-100 cm soil layer was determined using neutron scattering, and was generally higher in elevated CO2 plots than ambient. Peak aboveground biomass was greater on elevated CO2 plots than ambient CO2 plots with or without chambers during years with significant plant water stress. Above-ground regrowth biomass was greater under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 in a year with late-season water stress, but did not differ in a wetter year. Root ingrowth biomass was also greater in elevated CO2 plots than ambient CO2 plots when water stress occurred during the growing season. The basal cover and relative amount of warm-season perennial grasses (C4) in the stand changed little during the 8-year period, but basal cover and relative amount of cool-season perennial grasses (C3) in the stand declined in the elevated CO2 plots and in ambient CO2 plots with chambers. Forbs (C3) and members of the Cyperaceae (C3) increased in basal cover and relative amount in the stand at elevated compared to ambient CO2. Greater biomass production under elevated CO2 in C4-dominated grasslands may lead to a greater carbon sequestration by those ecosystems and reduce peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the future.","Above-ground biomass; Botanical composition; Carbon dioxide; Elevated CO2; Global climate change; Root biomass; Tallgrass prairie; Water-use efficiency","biological production; biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; community composition; global change; prairie; Cyperaceae; Poaceae",,,,,,"Agren, C.I., McMurtrie, R.E., Parton, W.J., Pastor, J., Shugart, H.K., State-of-the-art of models of production-decomposition linkages in conifer and grassland ecosystems (1991) Ecological Applications, 1, pp. 118-138; Anderson, K.L., Time of burning as it affects soil moisture in an ordinary upland bluestem prairie in the Flint Hills (1965) Journal of Range Management, 18, pp. 311-316; Anderson, K.L., Smith, E.F., Owensby, C.E., Burning bluestem range (1970) Journal of Range Management, 23, pp. 81-92; Bazzaz, F.A., The response of natural ecosystems to the rising global CÜ2 levels (1990) Annual Review D/Ecological Systernatics, 21, pp. 167-196; Bazzaz, F.A., Garbutt, K., The response of annuals in competitive neighborhoods: Effects of Elevated CO2 (1988) Ecology, 69, pp. 937-946; Bremer, D.I., (1994) Transpiration from a Tallgrass Prairie Exposed to Ambient and Elevated Atmospheric CO2., , MSc thesis, Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS; Sremer, D.J., Ham, J.M., Owensby, C.E., Effect of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and open-top chambers on transpiration in a tallgrass prairie (1996) Journal of Environmental Quality, 25, pp. 691-701; Carter, D.R., Peterson, K.M., Effects of a CO2-enriched atmosphere on the growth and competitive interaction of a C3 and C4 grass (1983) Oecologia, 58, pp. 188-193; Field, C.F., Chapin, F.S., Maison, P.A., Mooney, H.A., Responses of terrestrial ecosystems to the changing atmosphere: A resource-based approach (1992) Annual Review of Ecological Systematics, 23, pp. 201-235; Garbutt, K., Williams, W.E., Bazzaz, F.A., Analysis of the differential response of five annuals to elevated CC2 during growth (1990) Ecology, 7, pp. 1185-1194; Ham, J.M., Owensby, C.E., Coync, P.I., Bremer, D., Fluxes of CO2 and water vapor from a prairie ecosystem exposed to ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 (1995) Agriculture and Forest Meteorology, 77, pp. 73-93; Hamerlynck, E.P., McAllister, C.A., Knapp, A.K., Ham, J.M., Owensby, C.E., Photosynthetic gas exchange and water relation responses of three tallgrass prairie species to elevated carbon dioxide and moderate drought (1997) International Journal of Plant Science, 156, pp. 608-616; Hirschel, G., Korner, C., Arnone, J.A., Will rising atmospheric CO2 affect leaf litter quality and in situ decomposition rates in native plant communities?
