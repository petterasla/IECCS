Dynamics of resources depends both on planned economic activities and on changes of a climate. In this work the climatic component of changes is discussed. Projecting results used in this paper are based on the data of the CMIP3 (coupled model intercomparison project) in the framework of Working Group on Coupled Modelling. This project includes the world's best climate models. Results of modelling and the data of meteorological observations expressed by probability distribution functions (or empirical orthogonal functions) were compared. It was shown that the modelling data were much more reliable over flat territories. In result 11 most successful models were selected. They can be used for the forecast within the framework of known IPCC scenario A2 at the 21st century. Estimations of changes of volumes of a river runoff and conditions of humidity of territory have been allowed to determine that the serious reduction of resources is expected in the southern part of the East European plain. Its central and northern parts practically will not demonstrate changes. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change; Climate models; Humidity; Natural resources; Runoff","Climate model; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Economic activities; Empirical Orthogonal Function; Humidity; Meteorological observation; Power resources; River runoffs; Working groups; Distribution functions; Economics; Electric load forecasting; Fourier analysis; Global warming; Moisture; Orthogonal functions; Runoff; Water resources; Weather forecasting; Climate models",,,,,,"(1974) Atlas of Global Water Balance (In Russian), , Moscow, Gidrometeoizdat; Evstigneev, V.M., The studying of annual river runoff variability based on water balance equation (in Russian) (1990) Moscow Univ J, 5 (5), pp. 43-49; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , IPCC Geneva; Kislov, A.V., (2001) Climate in the Past, Present and Future (in Russian), p. 352. , Nauka/Interperiodika Moscow; Kislov, A.V., Evstigneev, V., Malchazova, S.M., (2008) The Projecting of the Climatically Induced Natural Resources of the East European Plane during the Global Warming of the 21 Century (In Russian), p. 292. , MaxPress Moscow; Kitaev, L.M., Connection between seasonal changes of the temperature and snow cover over the Northern Europe (2006) Criosphera Earth, (3), pp. 76-82; (1987) State Water Cadastre (In Russian), , Leningrad, Gidrometeoizdat","Kislov, A.; Departments of Meteorology and Climatology and Land Hydrology, Faculty of Geography, Moscow State University, Moscow, Russian Federation; email: avkislov@mail.ru",,,,,,,,10069321,,SCETF,,"English","Sci China Ser E Technol Sci",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-75749108911
