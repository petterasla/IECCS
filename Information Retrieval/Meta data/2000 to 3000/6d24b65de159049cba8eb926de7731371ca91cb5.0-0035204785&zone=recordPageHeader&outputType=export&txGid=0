Eddy correlation measurements of water vapour and sensible heat fluxes above the three dominant vegetation types: Fen, willow snowbed, and heath were conducted for the entire growing season. This was supplemented by measurements of evaporation from snow covered areas and from a small pond. The evapotranspiration was found to be relatively high with the maximum from the fen (≈86 mm per season). For the two other vegetation types the evaporatranspiration was less, for heath 61 mm per season, while willow snowbed had evaporation rates on intermediate level. By use of the Penman-Monteith equation it was possible to estimate the altitude dependence of the evapotranspiration and calculate the annual evaporation for the whole area to 80 mm per year. By applying a bucket model the evaporation was found to be in accordance with changes in soil moisture as monitored with TDR. The observed surface water balance was compared to river discharge, which shows a glacio-nival regime with an early spring flow (June), determined by the snow melt in the main valley and an July-August maximum determined by melt on higher plateau areas. When balancing the individual hydrological components an annual deficit of 180 mm was observed, but it was found that this deficit could be reduced by correcting for aerodynamic and altitude effects on the precipitation. Finally some of the possible consequences of a global warming is discussed in relation to the water and energy balance in the high-arctic ecosystem.",,"arctic environment; evapotranspiration; sensible heat flux; surface energy; water budget; water vapor; Greenland",,,,,,"Allerup, P., Madsen, H., Vejen, F., (1998) Standard Values (1961-90) for Precipitation Corrections, , Danish Meteorological Institute, Technical Report 98-10; Baldocchi, D.B., Hicks, B.B., Meyers, T.P., Measuring biosphere-atmosphere exchange of biologically related gases with micrometeorological methods (1988) Ecology, 69, pp. 1331-1340; Benson, S., Reassessment of winter precipitation on Alaska's arctic slope and measurements on the flux of wind-blown snow (1982) Rep UAG R-288, , Geophysical Institute,; University of Alaska, Fairbanks; Bliss, L.C., Matveyeva, N.V., Circumpolar arctic vegetation (1992) Arctic Ecosystems in a Changing Climate: An Ecophysiological Perspective, pp. 59-89. , Chapin III F.S., Jefferies R.L., Reynolds J.F., Shaver G.R., Svoboda J.
