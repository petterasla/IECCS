A climate change experiment is presented which uses a General Circulation Model (GCM) in which both interactive carbon and sulphur cycles have been included for the first time, along with the natural climate forcings due to solar changes and volcanic aerosol. These extra climate forcing factors have a significant impact on both 20th century climate change and the contemporary land and ocean carbon sinks. The additional forcings act to delay by more than a decade the conversion of the land carbon sink to a source, but ultimately result in a more abrupt rate of CO2 increase with the land carbon source (which reaches 7 GtC yr-1 by 2100) exceeding the ocean carbon sink (which saturates at 5 GtC yr-1 by 2100) beyond about 2080.",,"Aerosols; Carbon; Climatology; Volcanoes; Carbon cycle; Geophysics; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon cycle; climate forcing; climate modeling; feedback mechanism; sulfur cycle; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,"Cox, P.M., (2001) Description of the TRIFFID Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, , Technical Note 24, Hadley Centre, Met Office; Cox, P.M., Huntingford, C., Harding, R.J., A canopy conductance and photosynthesis model for use in a GCM land surface scheme (1998) J.
