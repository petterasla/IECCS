This study was performed in a 19-yr-old experiment that was set up on a degraded Paleudult (220 g kg -1 clay) in southern Brazil to (i) evaluate the effect of seven no-till crop rotations (grass- and legume-based cover crop systems) and mineral N fertilization (0 and 145 kg ha-1 yr-1) on soil organic C (SOC) stocks (0-17.5-cm depth) and (ii) estimate rates of SOM dynamics in these systems under subtropical climate conditions. Annual C input (shoot + root) ranged from 2.61 to 7.84 Mg ha , with the highest values in legume-based and N-fertilized cropping systems. The SOC stocks were closely related to C input levels, and a minimum C input of 4.05 Mg ha yr was estimated to maintain the original SOC stock of 31.38 Mg ha . Based on the one-compartment model of SOM dynamics, the SOM decomposition rate was estimated to be 1.2% and the humification coefficient was estimated to be 9.6%. After 19 yr, the stock of the original SOC decreased to about 24.78 Mg ha , while accumulation of SOC derived from the crops ranged from 4.26 to 12.79 Mg ha . Our results highlighted the benefits of legume cover crop species in no-till systems for the stabilization of SOC in degraded agricultural soils. © Soil Science Society of America.","145 N, Mean of 145 kg N ha-1 yr-1; F/M, fallow/maize; L+M, lablab+maize; O+V/M+C, black oat+vetch/maize+cowpea; O+V/M, black oat+vetch/maize; O/M, black oat/maize; ON, 0 kg N ha-1 yr -1; P+M, pigeon pea+maize; SOC, soil organic carbon; SOM, soil organic matter","145 N, Mean of 145 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr-<sup>1</sup>; F/M, fallow/maize; L+M, lablab+maize; O+V/M+C, black oat+vetch/maize+cowpea; O+V/M, black oat+vetch/maize; O/M, black oat/maize; ON, 0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr <sup>-1</sup>; P+M, pigeon pea+maize; SOC, soil organic carbon; SOM, soil organic matter; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Clay minerals; Crops; Global warming; Nitrogen fertilizers; Organic carbon; Programmable logic controllers; Rotation; Soils; Stabilization; Strength of materials; Soil conservation; agricultural soil; conservation management; cover crop; crop rotation; fallow; fertilizer application; global warming; legume; soil organic matter; tillage; Avena strigosa; Cajanus cajan; Lablab; Zea mays",,,,,,"Balesdent, J., Balabane, M., Maize root-derived soil organic carbon estimated by natural 13C abundance (1992) Soil Biol.
