Sci. and Indust. Res. Org., Division of Atmospheric Research, Aspendale, Vic., Australia","A coarse-grid global ocean general circulation model (OGCM) is used to determine the role of sub-grid scale eddy parametrization schemes in the response to idealized changes in the surface heat flux, of the same order as expected under increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Two schemes are employed. The first (H) incorporates standard horizontal mixing, whereas the second (G) combines both enhanced isopycnal mixing and eddy-induced transport. Uniform surface heating anomalies of + 2Wm-2 and -2 W m-2 are applied for 50 years, and the results are compared with a control experiment in which no anomalous heating is imposed. A passive ""heat"" tracer is applied uniformly (at a rate of 2Wm-2 for 50 years) in a separate experiment. The sea-surface temperature response to global surface heating is generally larger in G, especially in the northern sub-tropical gyres, along the southern coast of Australia and off the Antarctic coast. A pronounced interhemispheric asymmetry (primarily arising from an anomalous response south of 35 °S) is evident in both H and G. The surface trapping of passive tracers in the Southern Hemisphere is generally greater in G than it is in H, and is particularly pronounced along the prime meridian (O °E). Dynamical changes (i.e., changes in horizontal and vertical currents, convection, and preferred mixing and eddy transport pathways) enhance surface warming in the tropics and subtropics in both G and H. They are dominated by an anomalous meridional overturning centred on the equator, which may also operate in greenhouse warming experiments using coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs. Over the Southern Ocean the passive tracer experiments and associated ventilation rates suggest that surface warming will be greater in G than in H. In fact, the contrast between the dynamical responses evident in G and H in the actual heating experiments leads to a situation in which the reverse is often true. Overall, dynamical changes enhance the interhemispheric assymetry, more so in G than in H.",,"climate change; eddies; eddy; global warming; oceanic GCM; oceanic response; OGCM; parametrization schemes",,,,,,"Böning, C.W., Holland, W.R., Bryan, F.O., Danabasoglu, G., McWilliams, J.C., An overlooked problem in model simulations of the thermohaline circulation and heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean (1995) J Clim, 8, pp. 515-523; Bryan, F., High-latitude salinity effects and interhemispheric thermohaline circulations (1986) Nature, 323, pp. 301-304; Bryan, K., A numerical method for the study of the circulation of the world ocean (1969) J Computat Phys, 4, pp. 347-376; Bryan, K., Accelerating the convergence to equilibrium of ocean-climate models (1984) J Phys Oceanogr, 14, pp. 666-673; Bryan, K., Manabe, S., A coupled ocean-atmosphere and the response to increasing atmospheric CO2 (1985) Coupled Ocean-atmosphere Models, pp. 1-6. , Nihoul JCJ (ed), Elsevier, Amsterdam; Bryan, K., Spelman, M.J., The ocean's response to a CO2-indiced warming (1985) J Geophys Res, 90, pp. 11679-11688; Bryan, K., Komro, F.G., Manabe, S., Spelman, M.J., Transient climate response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (1982) Science, 215, pp. 56-58; Bryan, K., Komro, F.G., Rooth, C., The ocean's transient response to global surface temperature anomalies (1984) Maurice Ewing, 5, pp. 29-38. , Hansen JE, Takahashi T (eds) American Geophysical Union, Washington DC, Geophysical Monograph 29; Bryan, K., Lewis, L.J., A water mass model of the world ocean (1979) J Geophys Res, 84, pp. 347-376; Cai, W., Surface thermohaline forcing conditions and the response of the present-day global ocean climate to global warming (1996) J Geophys Res, 101, pp. 1079-1093; Clement, A.C., Seager, R., Cane, M.A., Zebiak, S.E., An ocean dynamical thermostat (1996) J Clim, 9, pp. 2190-2196; Colman, R.A., Power, S.B., McAvaney, B.J., Dahni, R.R., A non-flux corrected transient CO2 experiment using the BMRC coupled atmosphere/ocean GCM (1995) Geophys Res Lett, 22, pp. 3047-3050; Cox, M., (1984) A Primitive Equation, Three-dimensional Model of the Ocean, , GFDL Ocean Group Tech Rep 1 GFDL/Princeton; Cox, M., Isopycnal diffusion in a z-coordinate ocean model (1987) Ocean Model, 74, pp. 1-5; Cubasch, U., Hasselmann, K., Maier-Reimer, E., Mikolajewicz, U., Santer, B.D., Sausen, R., Time-dependent greenhouse warming computations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model (1992) Clim Dyn, 8, pp. 55-70; Cummins, P.F., Holloway, G., Gargett, A.E., Sensitivity of the GFDL ocean model to parametrization of vertical diffusion (1990) J Phys Oceanogr, 20, pp. 817-830; Danabasoglu, G., McWilliams, J.C., Sensitivity of the global ocean circulation to parameterizations of mesoscale tracer transports (1995) J Clim, 8, pp. 2967-2987; Danabasoglu, G., McWilliams, J.C., Gent, P.R., The role of mesoscale tracer transports in the global ocean circulation (1994) Science, 264, pp. 1123-1126; Dixon, K.W., Bullister, J.L., Gammon, R.H., Stouffer, R.J., Examining a coupled climate model using CFC-111 as an ocean tracer (1996) Geophys Res Lett, 23, pp. 1957-1960; Duffy, P.B., Eliason, D., Bourgeois, A.J., Covey, C., Simulation of bomb radiocarbon in two OGCMs (1995) J Geophys Res, 100, pp. 22545-22565; England, M.H., On the formation of global-scale water masses in ocean general circulation models (1993) J Phys Oceanogr, 23, pp. 1523-1552; England, M.H., Using chlorofluorocarbons to assess ocean climate models (1995) Geophys Res Lett, 22, pp. 3051-3054; Gent, P.R., McWilliams, J.C., Isopycnal mixing in ocean circulation models (1990) J Phys Oceanogr, 20, pp. 150-155; Gent, P.R., Willebrand, J., McDougall, T.J., McWilliams, J.C., Parametrizing eddy-induced tracer transports in ocean circulation models (1995) J Phys Oceanogr, 25, pp. 463-474; Gordon, H., O'Farrell, S., Transient climate change in the CSIRO coupled model with dynamical sea ice (1996) Mon Weather Rev, , accepted; Gough, W.A., Welsh, W.J., Parameter space exploration of an ocean general circulation model using an isopycnal mixing parameterization (1994) J Mar Res, 52, pp. 773-796; Haney, R.L., Surface thermal boundary conditions for ocean circulation models (1971) J Phys Oceanogr, 4, pp. 241-248; Hansen, J.E., Lacis, A., Rind, D., Russell, G., Stone, P., Fung, I., Ruedy, R., Lerner, L., Climate sensitivity: Analysis of feedback mechanisms (1984) Climate Processes and Climate Sensitivity, pp. 130-163. , Geophys.
