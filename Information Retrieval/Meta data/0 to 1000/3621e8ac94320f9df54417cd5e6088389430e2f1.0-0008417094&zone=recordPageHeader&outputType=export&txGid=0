The boreal zone is circumscribed by the isotherms of 15°C and 45°C of Kira's Warmth Index (WI) and includes the territory of the Amur basin, the seashores of the Sea of Okhotsk, Kamchatka, Sakhalin and the Kuril islands. Boreal forests also occur on the mountains of Hokkaido, Honshu, Korea and NE China. The oceanic sectors of the boreal zone are composed mainly of birch forests, the marine sectors of spruce-fir forests and the continental sectors of larch and pine forests. The upper limit of the boreal forests ascends from the lowest level in the North to ca. 1500 m a.s.l. in the South of the zone, and reaches above 2500 m in the mountains of the temperate zone. In the boreal zone the secondary forests are common. They form after fires and cutting. Volcanism is an essential factor in the forest dynamics in the oceanic part of the region. It is suggested that as a result of global warming one may expect a strong alteration in vegetation pattern, especially in the northern and mountain areas. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Boreal forests; Forest vegetation pattern; Monsoon Asia; Vegetation dynamics; Zonation of vegetation",,,,,,,"Ageenko A.S.
