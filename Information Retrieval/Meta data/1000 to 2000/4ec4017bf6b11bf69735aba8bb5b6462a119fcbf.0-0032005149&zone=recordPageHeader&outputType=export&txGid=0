In spite of the uncertainties about the precise magnitude of climate change on regional scales, an assessment of the possible impacts of changes in key climatic elements on our agricultural resources is important for formulating response strategies. In this study, vulnerability of wheat and rice crops in northwest India to the projected climate change is examined. CERES wheat and rice models adopted for the study were validated for their ability to reproduce yields at the selected NW Indian stations. The sensitivity experiments with these models showed higher yields for both wheat and rice (28% and 15% respectively for a doubling of CO2) under elevated CO2 levels. A 3°C (2°C) rise in air temperature early cancels out the positive effect of elevated CO2 on the wheat (rice) yields. While the wheat crops are found to be sensitive to increase in maximum temperature, the rice crops are vulnerable to increase in minimum temperature. The combined effect of enhanced CO2 and imposed thermal stress on the wheat (rice) crop is 21% (4%) increase in yield for the irrigation schedule presently practised in the region. While the adverse impacts of likely water shortage on wheat crops would be minimised to a certain extent under elevated CO2 levels, they would largely be maintained for the rice crops resulting in about 20% net decline in rice yields. In general, acute water shortage conditions combined with the thermal stress should adversely affect both the wheat and more severely the rice productivity in NW India even under the positive effects of elevated CO2 in the future.","CERES wheat and rice models; Climate change; CO2 levels","agricultural impact; climate change; crop yield; global warming; rice; wheat; yield; India",,,,,,"Alocilja, E.C., Ritchie, R.T., Rice simulation and its use in multicriteria optimisation (1988) IBSNAT Research Report Series, 1; Butterfield, R.E., Morison, J.I.L., Modelling the impact of climate warming on winter cereal development (1992) Agric.
