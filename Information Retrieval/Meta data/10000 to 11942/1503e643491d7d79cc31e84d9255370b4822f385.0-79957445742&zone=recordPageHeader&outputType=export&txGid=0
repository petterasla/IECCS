This decade has seen increasing importance of chemically treated vegetable oil biodiesel fuels for various applications in heat engines. Post-Kyoto negotiations refer to high level talks attempting to address global warming by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. During Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen the potential topics discussed were carbon capture and storage, biofuels, adaptation financing, technology transfer, sustainable agriculture, emissions targets, tropical forests and rural and transport electrification. Our area of interest is biofuels under which nonedible Jatropha oil due to its properties which are very close to diesel fuel is being explored as an alternative fuel. A lot of research is underway in the use of different biodiesel fuels in Internal Combustion engines, but very limited work has been reported in its use in gas turbines. This paper describes the results of an ongoing development program aimed at determining the technical feasibility of utilizing biodiesel in IS/60 Rovers gas turbine. The test rig is equipped with a dynamometer for turbine loading and AVL exhaust gas analyzer has been used to record emissions. The test results of 2 blends have been reported in this paper. Analyzing the results compared with the base line performance using diesel fuel under normal conditions show encouraging outcomes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Emissions; Gas turbines; Jatropha","Alternative energy source; Area of interest; Base-line performance; Bio-diesel fuel; Carbon capture and storage; Copenhagen; Development programs; Emissions; Exhaust gas analyzers; Jatropha; Jatropha oil; Normal condition; Oil crisis; Sustainable agriculture; Technical feasibility; Test results; Test rigs; Tropical forest; Agriculture; Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Blending; Carbon dioxide; Diesel fuels; Electric utilities; Engineering research; Gas turbines; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Synthetic fuels; Technology transfer; Turbomachinery; Vegetable oils; Gas emissions; alternative energy; alternative fuel; biofuel; conference proceeding; emission control; emission inventory; ester; global warming; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; shrub; turbine; vegetable oil; Denmark; Hovedstaden; Kobenhavn [(RGG) Hovedstaden]; Emmelichthyidae; Jatropha",,,,,,"(2005), Urja Vikas Nigam (M.P).
