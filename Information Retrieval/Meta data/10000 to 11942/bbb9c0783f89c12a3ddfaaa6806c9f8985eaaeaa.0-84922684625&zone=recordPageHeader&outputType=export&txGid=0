This paper measures the variability of annual surface air temperature of five major cities of Pakistan (Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Hyderabad and Karachi) for the period from 1882 to 2003. We perform an exploratory analysis which shows that the annual landmass air temperature series of five relatively more important climate stations of Pakistan obey the normal distribution. A subsequent trend analysis shows that the temperature has been increasing in the twentieth century for the five (major) cities of Pakistan, the increase being 0.3°C to 1.0°C. We computations based on Bayesian analysis for two samples (e.g., for Lahore, we use data for the period from 1882 to 1960 and 1961-2000 for first sample and second sample, respectively) of temperature data of five cites shows that the average of annual mean temperature for the second period is higher than the average of first period. Thus, Bayesian inferencing shows that the general pattern of evolution of temperature over Pakistan is pretty similar to the current global warming configuration. © Saudi Society for Geosciences 2010.","Global warming; Temperature; Trend",,,,,,,"Angell, J.K., Variation in the cloudiness and sunshine duration between 1950 and the drought year of 1988 (1990) J Climate, 3, pp. 296-308; Arseni-Papadiomitriou, A., Maheras, P., Some statistical characteristics of air temperature variations (1991) Theor Appl Climated, 43, pp. 105-112; Colacino, M., Rovelli, A., The early averaged air temperature in rome from 1782 to 1975 (1983) Tellus, 35, pp. 389-397; Cooter, E.J., Le Duc, S.K., Recent frost date trends in the northeastern usa (1995) Int J Climatol, 15, pp. 65-75; Cruz, R.V., Harasawa, H., Lal, M., Wu, S., Anokhin, Y., Punsalmaa, B., Honda, Y., Huu Ninh, N., Asia.
