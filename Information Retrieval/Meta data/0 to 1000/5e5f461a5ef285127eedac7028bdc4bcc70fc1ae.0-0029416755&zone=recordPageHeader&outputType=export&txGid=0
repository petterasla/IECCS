Relevant quantitative cases of long-run technical change during the past 100 years are presented in computing, communications, transport, energy, and agriculture. A noteworthy technological trajectory is that of decarbonization, or decreasing carbon intensity of primary energy. If human societies have not yet reached the end of the history of technology, the cost structure for mitigation and adaptation changes could be cheap. © 1995.","Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Technical progress; Technological trajectories","carbon emission; climate change; climatic change; environmental economics; fossil fuel; global warming; technical change; technological change; Climate change; Decarbonization; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Societies and institutions; Technology; Greenhouse gases; Technical progress; Technological trajectories; Energy policy",,,,,,"Angelucci, Matricardi, (1977) Practical Guide to World Airplanes, 1-4. , Mondadori, Milan, (in Italian); Ausubel, Grübler, Nakićenović, Carbon dioxide emissions in a methane economy (1988) Climatic Change, 12, pp. 245-263; Cerf, Navasky, (1984) The Experts Speak: The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformation, , Pantheon, New York; Darmstaedter, (1908) Handbuch zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Technik, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin; Grey, Jane's All the World's Aircraft (1969) Reprint of 1919 Edition, , David and Charles, London; Grübler, (1990) The Rise and Fall of Infrastructures, , Physica, Heidelberg; IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Lloyd, A potentially realizable quantum computer (1993) Science, 261, pp. 1569-1571; Lotka, (1924) Elements of Physical Biology, , Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, reprinted 1956, Dover, New York; Marchetti, Energy systems: the broader context (1979) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 15, pp. 79-86; Marchetti, Society as a learning system (1980) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 18, pp. 267-282; Mensch, (1979) Stalemate in Technology, , Ballinger, Cambridge, MA; Nordhaus, An optimal transition path for controlling greenhouse gases (1992) Science, 258, pp. 1315-1319; Patel, Lasers in communications and information processing (1987) Lasers: Invention to Application, , JH Ausubel, WD Langford, National Academy, Washington, DC; Starr, Rudman, Parameters of technological growth (1973) Science, 182, pp. 358-364; Taylor, (1984) Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1984–1985, , Jane's, London; Tertullian De Anima (1993) Waszink, J H (ed) H J Paris, Amsterdam, chapter 30 sec 4, p 112Waggoner, (1994) How Much Land Can Ten Billion People Spare for Nature?, , Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, Ames, IA; Worlton, (1988) Some Patterns of Technological Change in High Performance Computers, , Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, New York, CH2617-9","Ausubel, J.H.; Program for the Human Environment, The Rockefeller University, NR 403, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021-6399, United States",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029416755
