At the interface between these two major signalling systems are the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and signalling factors including protein kinases and transcription factors. Scope This briefing reviews links between ABA, stress and sugar signalling, focusing on the roles of sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases (SnRKs), SnRK1-activating protein kinases (SnAKs), calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and ABA response element binding proteins (AREBPs, which are transcription factors). Links between stress and nitrogen / amino acid signalling are also described, including the roles of a protein kinase called general control non-derepressible (GCN)-2 in regulating protein synthesis through phosphorylation of the -subunit of translation initiation factor-2 (eIF2) in response not only to decreases in amino acid levels but also to a range of stresses. Evidence of a link between sugar and amino acid signalling is explored, with nitrate reductase being a target for regulation by both SnRK1 and GCN2 through different mechanisms; possible links between SnRK1 and GCN2 via a pathway including the protein kinase target of rapamycin (TOR)-1 are described. The significance of these interactions to the concept of signalling networks as opposed to simple cascades and pathways, and the importance of the subject in the context of the predicted increase in severity and range of stresses that plants will have to withstand as a result of global climate change are discussed.","ABA (abscisic acid); AREBP (ABA response element binding protein); CDPK (calcium-dependent protein kinase); Climate change; GCN2 (general control non-derepressible 2); Metabolic signalling; Protein kinase; Signalling networks","abscisic acid; basic leucine zipper transcription factor; vegetable protein; abscisic acid; amino acid; climate change; enzyme activity; metabolism; salinity; signal; article; biological model; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; signal transduction; Abscisic Acid; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Models, Biological; Plant Proteins; Signal Transduction; Stress, Physiological",,"abscisic acid, 21293-29-8; Abscisic Acid, 21293-29-8; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Plant Proteins",,,,"Avruch, J., Hara, K., Lin, Y., Insulin and amino-acid regulation of mTOR signaling and kinase activity through the Rheb GTPase (2006) Oncogene, 25, pp. 6361-6372; Baena-González, E., Rolland, F., Thevelein, J.M., Sheen, J., A central integrator of transcription networks in plant stress and energy signalling (2007) Nature, 448, pp. 938-942; Bilgin, D.D., Liu, Y., Schiff, M., Dinesh-Kumar, S.P., P58IPK, a plant ortholog of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR inhibitor, functions in viral pathogenesis and cell death (2003) Developmental Cell, 4, pp. 451-661; Crum, C.J., Hu, J., Hiddinga, H.J., Roth, D.A., Tobacco mosaic virus infection stimulates the phosphorylation of a plant protein associated with double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase activity (1988) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 263, pp. 13440-13443; Deprost, D., Yao, L., Sormani, R., The Arabidopsis TOR kinase links plant growth, yield, stress resistance and mRNA translation (2007) EMBO Reports, 8, pp. 864-870; Douglas, P., Moorhead, G., Hong, Y., Morrice, N., MacKintosh, C., Purification of a nitrate reductase kinase from Spinacea oleracea leaves, and its identification as a calmodulin-domain protein kinase (1998) Planta, 206, pp. 435-442; Francis, D., Halford, N.G., Nutrient sensing in plant meristems (2006) Plant Molecular Biology, 60, pp. 981-993; Furihata, T., Maruyama, K., Fujita, Y., Abscisic acid-dependent multisite phosphorylation regulates the activity of a transcription activator AREB1 (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 103, pp. 1988-1993; Gómez-Cadenas, A., Verhey, S.D., Holappa, L.D., Shen, Q., T-Hd, H., Walker-Simmons, M.K., An abscisic acid-induced protein kinase, PKABA1, mediates abscisic acid-suppressed gene expression in barley aleurone layers (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 96, pp. 1767-1772; Guo, Y., Xiong, L., Song, C.-P., Gong, D., Halfter, U., Zhu, J.-K., A calcium sensor and its interacting protein kinase are global regulators of abscisic acid signaling in Arabidopsis (2002) Developmental Cell, 3, pp. 233-244; Halford, N.G., Regulation of carbon and amino acid metabolism, roles of sucrose nonfermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 and general control nonderepressible-2-related protein kinase (2006) Advances in Botanical Research Including Advances in Plant Pathology, 43, pp. 93-142; Halford, N.G., Hey, S.J., SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRKs) act within an intricate network that links metabolic and stress signalling in plants (2009) Biochemical Journal, 419, pp. 247-259; Hey, S., Mayerhofer, H., Halford, N.G., Dickinson, J.R., DNA sequences from Arabidopsis which encode protein kinases and function as upstream regulators of Snf1 in yeast (2007) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 282, pp. 10472-10479; Hinnebusch, A.G., Translational regulation of GCN4 and the general amino acid control of yeast (2005) Annual Review of Microbiology, 59, pp. 407-450; Hrabak, E.M., Chan, C.W.M., Gribskov, M., The Arabidopsis CDPK-SnRK superfamily of protein kinases (2003) Plant Physiology, 132, pp. 666-680; Huang, J.-Z., Huber, S.C., Phosphorylation of synthetic peptides by a CDPK and SNF1-related protein kinase.
