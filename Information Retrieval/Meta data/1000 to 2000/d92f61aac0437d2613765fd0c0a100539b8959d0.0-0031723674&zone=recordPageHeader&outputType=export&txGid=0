Variability in entomological parameters, biting rates and entomological inoculation rates (EIR) have been strongly associated with attack rates in children. The goal of this study was to assess the weather's impact on weekly biting and EIR in the endemic area of Kisian, Kenya. Entomological data collected by the U.S. Army from March 1986 through June 1988 at Kisian, Kenya was analysed with concurrent weather data from nearby Kisumu airport. A soil moisture model of surface-water availability was used to combine multiple weather parameters with landcover and soil features to improve disease prediction. Modelling soil moisture substantially improved prediction of biting rates compared to rainfall; soil moisture lagged two weeks explained up to 45% of An. gambiae biting variability, compared to 8% for raw precipitatior. For An. funestus, soil moisture explained 32% variability, peaking after a 4-week lag. The interspecie difference in response to soil moisture was significant (P &lt; 0.00001). A satellite normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) of the study site yielded a similar correlation (r2 = 0.42 An. gambiae). Modelled soil moisture accounted for up to 56% variability of An. gambiae EIR, peaking at a lag of six weeks. The relationship between temperature and An. gambiae biting rates was less robust; maximum temperature r2 = -0.20, and minimum temperature r2 = 0.12 after lagging one week. Benefits of hydrological modelling are compared to raw weather parameters and to satellite NDVI. These findings can improve both current malaria risk assessments and those based on El Nino forecasts or global climate change model projection.","Anopheles; Climate; El Nino; Greenhouse effect; Malaria; Modelling; Weather","disease transmission; inoculation; malaria; modeling; risk assessment; soil moisture; anopheles; article; correlation function; disease transmission; greenhouse effect; human; insect bite; kenya; malaria; moisture; nonhuman; parasite incidence; risk assessment; seasonal variation; soil; weather; Animals; Anopheles; Humans; Insect Bites and Stings; Malaria; Models, Biological; Rain; Soil; Temperature; Weather; Kenya; Insecta; Protozoa",,"Soil",,,,"Alonso, P.L., Smith, T., Armstrong Schellenberg, J.R.M., Randomised trial of efficacy of SPf66 vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in southern Tanzania (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 1175-1181; Beck, L.R., Rodriguez, M.H., Dister, S.W., Assessment of a remote sensing-based model for predicting malaria transmission risk in villages of Chiapas, Mexico (1997) American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 56, pp. 99-106; Becker, R.A., Chambers, J.M., Wilks, A.R., (1988) The New S Language, , Wadsworth and Brooks, Cole; Beier, J.C., Oster, C.N., Onyango, F.N., Plasmodium falciparum incidence relative to entomologic inoculation rates at a site proposed for testing malaria vaccines in Western Kenya (1994) American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 50, pp. 529-536; Beier, J.C., Perkins, P.V., Onyango, F.K., Characterization of malaria transmission by Anopheles (diptera: Culicidae) in Western Kenya in press for malaria vaccine trials (1990) Journal of Medical Entomology, 27, pp. 570-577; Beier, J.C., Perkins, P.V., Wirtz, R.A., Field evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite detection in anopheline mosquitoes from Kenya (1987) American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 36, pp. 459-468; Bouma, M.J., Sondorp, H.E., Van Der Kaay, H.J., Climate Change and periodic epidemic malaria (1994) Lancet, 343, p. 1440; Bouma, M.J., Van Der Kaay, H.J., Epidemic malaria in India and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (1994) Lancet, 344, pp. 1638-1639; Bouma, M.J., Van Der Kaay, H.J., The El Nino southern oscillation and the historic malaria epidemics on the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka: An early warning system for future epidemics?
