Alexander Drive, RTP, NC 27711, United States","Methane (CH4) emission controls are found to be a powerful lever for reducing both global warming and air pollution via decreases in background tropospheric ozone (O3). Reducing anthropogenic CH4 emissions by 50% nearly halves the incidence of U.S. high-O3 events and lowers global radiative forcing by 0.37 W m-2 (0.30 W m-2 from CH4, 0.07 W m-2 from O3) in a 3-D model of tropospheric chemistry. A 2030 simulation based upon IPCC A1 emissions projections shows a longer and more intense U.S. O3 pollution season despite domestic emission reductions, indicating that intercontinental transport and a rising O3 background should be considered when setting air quality goals.",,"Computer simulation; Global warming; Methane; Ozone; Troposphere; Ozone pollution; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission control; methane; ozone; standard (regulation)",,,,,,"Bey, I., Global modeling of tropospheric chemistry with assimilated meteorology: Model description and evaluation (2001) J.
