The Southern California Bight has a particularly complex shelf configuration, of tectonic origin, which poses a challenge to predictions of wave driven, morphologic coastal change. Northward shifts in cyclonic activity in the central Pacific Ocean, which may arise due to global climate change, will significantly alter the heights, periods, and directions of waves approaching the California coasts. In this paper, we present the results of a series of numerical experiments that explore the sensitivity of longshore sediment transport patterns to changes in deep water wave direction, for several wave height and period scenarios. We outline a numerical modeling procedure, which links a spectral wave transformation model (SWAN) with a calculation of gradients in potential longshore sediment transport rate (CGEM), to project magnitudes of potential coastal erosion and accretion, under proscribed deep water wave conditions. The sediment transport model employs two significant assumptions: (1) quantity of sediment movement is calculated for the transport-limited case, as opposed to supply-limited case, and (2) nearshore wave conditions used to evaluate transport are calculated at the 5-meter isobath, as opposed to the wave break point. To illustrate the sensitivity of the sedimentary system to changes in deep-water wave direction, we apply this modeling procedure to two sites that represent two different coastal exposures and bathymetric configurations. The Santa Barbara site, oriented with a roughly west-to-east trending coastline, provides an example where the behavior of the coastal erosional/accretional character is exacerbated by deep-water wave climate intensification. Where sheltered, an increase in wave height enhances accretion, and where exposed, increases in wave height and period enhance erosion. In contrast, all simulations run for the Torrey Pines site, oriented with a north-to-south trending coastline, resulted in erosion, the magnitude of which was strongly influenced by wave height and less so by wave period. At both sites, the absolute value of coastal accretion or erosion strongly increases with a shift from northwesterly to westerly waves. These results provide some examples of the potential outcomes, which may result from increases in cyclonic activity, El Niño frequency, or other changes in ocean storminess that may accompany global climate change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Absolute values; California; Coastal accretions; Coastal change; Coastal erosion; Coastal exposure; Cyclonic activities; Deep-water waves; Global climate changes; Longshore sediment transport; Modeling procedure; Morphologic changes; Near-shore waves; Numerical experiments; Numerical modeling; Pacific ocean; Potential outcomes; Santa Barbara; Sediment movement; Sediment transport model; Sedimentary systems; Southern California; Southern California Bight; Transformation patterns; Wave break; Wave direction; Wave heights; Wave period; Wave transformations; Anoxic sediments; Bathymetry; Coastal engineering; Erosion; Nickel compounds; Ocean currents; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sedimentology; Water waves; Climate change; accretion; bathymetric survey; climate change; climate effect; coastal erosion; coastal morphology; El Nino; global climate; longshore transport; shoaling wave; storm surge; wave direction; wave height; California; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Central); United States; Pinus torreyana",,,,,,"Adams, P., Inman, D., Graham, N., Southern California deep-water wave climate: characterization and application to coastal processes (2008) J Coast Res, 24 (4), pp. 1022-1035; Arthur, R., The effect of islands on surface waves (1951) Bulletin of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, (1), p. 6; Ashton, A., Murray, A., High-angle wave instability and emergent shoreline shapes: 1. modeling of sand waves, flying spits, and capes (2006) J Geophys Res Earth Surf, 111 (F4). , F04,011; Ashton, A., Murray, A., Arnoult, O., Formation of coastline features by large-scale instabilities induced by high-angle waves (2001) Nature, 414 (6861), pp. 296-300; Aumann, H., Ruzmaikin, A., Teixeira, J., Frequency of severe storms and global warming (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35 (19), p. 1516; Bender, C., Dean, R., Wave field modification by bathymetric anomalies and resulting shoreline changes: a review with recent results (2003) Coast Eng, 49 (1-2), pp. 125-153; Booij, N., Ris, R., Holthuijsen, L., A third-generation wave model for coastal regions. 1.Model description and validation (1999) J Geophys Res, 104 (C4), pp. 7649-7666; Bromirski, P., Flick, R., Cayan, D., Storminess variability along the California coast: 1858-2000 (2003) J Clim, 16 (6), pp. 982-993; Bromirski, P., Cayan, D., Flick, R., Wave spectral energy variability in the northeast pacific (2005) J Geophys Res, 110. , C03,005; Christiansen, R.L., Yeats, R.S., Post-Laramide geology of the U.
