Three different 100-yr daily weather sequences were input to the model. The first was produced using statistics of current (1961–90) weather records. The second and third sequences were based on modifications of these historic statistics according to the monthly mean temperature and precipitation changes associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf>as predicted by two different general circulation models. For 2 × CO<inf>2</inf> conditions, mean annual water balances for all four watersheds indicated modest (1–9%) decreases in precipitation, but much larger (16–42%) decreases in streamflow due to increases in evapotranspiration. Winter flows generally increased, but flows in the remaining seasons often decreased. Monthly streamflow changes varied considerably among watersheds, and we could not attribute these changes to specific differences in land uses or soils. © ASCE.",,"Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Environmental impact; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Statistics; Watersheds; General circulation model (GCM); Stream flow; Global Warming; Modelling; Streams; carbon dioxide; evapotranspiration; GCM; global warming; precipitation; temperature; USA, New York State",,,,,,"Anderson, E.A., National Weather Service River Forecast System—Snow Accumulation and Ablation Model (1976) NOAA Tech.
