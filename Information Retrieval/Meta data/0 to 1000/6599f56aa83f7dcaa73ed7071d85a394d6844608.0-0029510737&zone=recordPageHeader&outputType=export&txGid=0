Species richness and cover did not respond to elevated CO2. After one month of treatment, CO2 exchange measured during the day did not differ between CO2 levels but the night respiration was two-fold higher under elevated CO2. Results suggest that despite some downward adjustment of photosynthesis, net canopy photosynthesis was stimulated by elevated CO2, but this stimulation was compensated for by an increased respiration. Results suggest that in low-productivity Mediterranean herbaceous systems, the greatest effect of CO2 is on the turnover of carbon in plants. -from Authors",,"biomass; carbon balance; carbon dioxide enrichment; community structure; mediterranean ecosystem; old-field grassland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13541013,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029510737
