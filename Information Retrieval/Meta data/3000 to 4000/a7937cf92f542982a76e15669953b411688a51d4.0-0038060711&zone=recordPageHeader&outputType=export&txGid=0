The final lowering of lake levels occurred at approximately 7600 14C yr BP, after which lake levels began to rise again to the Nipissing highstand at approximately 4700 14C yr BP. During this time of rising lake levels, black bands of iron sulfide were being formed in the sediments of all five of the Great Lakes. These bands signify suboxic to anoxic conditions, at least within the sediments and possibly at the sediment-water interface, during the middle Holocene warm interval. During this interval, the climate was warmer and drier than present, possibly resulting in the occasional absence of seasonal turnover in the lakes. We examined a series of piston cores from northern Lakes Michigan and Huron and found that the black bands are correlatable among cores taken from within the same basin. The observation that the banding can be correlated suggests a basin-wide cause, near-bottom or sub-bottom anoxia in the northern Michigan and northern Huron sediments during the mid-Holocene warm period. The sedimentary and geochemical processes in the Great Lakes during the middle Holocene warm interval are good indicators of possible future scenarios for the lakes as a result of global warming, as 21st-century temperatures are predicted to reach similar levels due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.","Great Lakes; Lake Huron; Lake Michigan; Mid-Holocene warm period; Paleolimnology","anoxic conditions; Holocene; paleolimnology; sediment core; stratigraphy; North America",,,,,,"Antevs, E., The Great Basin, with emphasis on glacial and postglacial times.
