The production of one Tonne of cement contributes about 1.1 Tonne of carbon dioxide gas to the atmosphere together with oxides of nitrogen and methane. These are the main pollutants of the atmosphere which leads to the global warming. The total carbon dioxide contribution by the world cement production industries accounts around 7 %. This paper discusses the issues of global warming and the need for the development of efficient blending material of concrete. Activated fly ash concrete at various replacement levels was found that it reduces the emission of CO2 gases and enhances the inhibition to corrosive atmosphere.","Carbon dioxide; Fly ash blended cement; Global warming",,,,,,,"Miller Jr., G.T., (2004) Environmental Science, pp. 280-304. , 10th edition Thomson Brooks/Cole International Students edition, Singapore, pp; Malhotra, V.M., (1999) Indian Concrete J, 73, p. 609; Ganesan, K., Rajagopal, K., Thangavel, K., Selvaraj, R., Saraswathy, V., (2004) Indian Concrete J, 78, p. 29; Malhotra, V.M., (2001) Concrete proceedings of the 7th ACI/CANMET International Conference Chennai, 1, p. 957. , sp 199; Sheshasayi, V.A., Sudhakar, M., (2004) Indian Concrete J, 78, p. 11; Poon, C.S., Kou, S.C., Lam, L., Lin, Z.S., (2001) Cement Concrete Res, 30, p. 873; M.
