The basis of the analysis is information taken from a climate change simulation performed with a state-of-the-art general circulation model (the Hadley Centre model). First, it is shown that the model is unable to reproduce accurately the statistics of daily maximum and minimum temperature at the site. Second, using a re-analysis data set, downscaling models are developed to predict site temperature from large-scale free atmosphere variables derived from the sea level pressure and 500 hPa geopotential height fields. In particular, the relative performances of linear models and non-linear artificial neural networks are compared using a set of rigorous validation techniques. It is shown that even a simple configuration of a 2-layer non-linear neural network significantly improves on the performance of a linear model. Finally, the non-linear neural network model is initialised with general circulation model output to construct scenarios of daily temperature at the present day (1970-79) and for a future decade (2090-99). These scenarios are analysed with special attention to the comparison of the frequencies of heat waves (days with maximum temperature greater than 35°C) and cold spells (days with minimum temperature below 5°C).","Artificial neural networks; Climate change scenarios; Downscaling; Portugal","artificial neural network; climate change; global warming; temperature; Portugal",,,,,,"Bishop, C.M., (1995) Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, , Clarendon Press, Oxford; Breiman, L., Bagging predictions (1997) Machine Learning, 24, pp. 123-140; Cavazos, T., Downscaling large-scale circulation to local winter rainfall in north-eastern Mexico (1997) Int J Climatol, 17, pp. 1069-1082; Corte-Real, J., Zhang, X., Wang, X., Downscaling GCM information to regional scales: A non-parametric multivariate approach (1995) Clim Dyn, 11, pp. 413-424; Corte-Real, J., Qian, B., Xu, H., Regional climate change in Portugal: Precipitation variability associated with large-scale atmospheric circulation (1998) Int J Climatol, 18, pp. 619-635; Corte-Real, J., Xu, H., Qian, B., A weather generator for obtaining daily precipitation scenarios based on circulation patterns (1999) Clim Res, 13, pp. 61-75; Crane, R.G., Hewitson, B.C., Doubled CO2 climate change scenarios for the Susquehanna Basin: Precipitation (1998) Int J Climatol, 18, pp. 65-76; Gardner, M.W., Dorling, S.R., Artificial Neural Networks (the multilayer perceptron) - A review of applications in the atmospheric sciences (1998) Atmos Environ, 32, pp. 2627-2636; Gardner, M.W., Dorling, S.R., Neural network modelling and prediction of hourly NOx and NO2 concentrations in urban air London (1999) Atmos Environ, 33, pp. 709-719; Giorgi, F., Simulation of regional climate using a limited area model in a general circulation model (1990) J Clim, 3, pp. 941-963; Goodess, C.M., Palutikof, J.P., Development of daily rainfall scenarios for Southeast Spain using a circulation type approach to downscaling (1998) Int J Climatol, 18, pp. 1051-1081; Hagan, M.T., Demuth, H.B., Beale, M.H., (1996) Neural Networks Design, , PWS Publishing Company, Boston; Haykin, S., (1994) Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation, , Macmillan College Publishing Company, New York; Hewitson, B.C., Crane, R.G., Large-scale atmospheric controls on local precipitation in tropical Mexico (1992) Geophys Res Lett, 19, pp. 1835-1838; Hewitson, B.C., Crane, R.G., Climate downscaling: Techniques and application (1996) Clim Res, 7, pp. 85-95; Hornik, K., Stinchcombe, M., White, H., Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators (1989) Neural Networks, 2, pp. 359-366; Johns, T.C., Carnell, R.E., Crossley, J.F., Gregory, J.M., Mitchell, J.F.B., Senior, C.A., Tett, S.F.B., Wood, R.A., The second Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM: Model description, spinup and validation (1997) Clim Dyn, 13, pp. 103-134; Jones, R.G., Murphy, J.M., Noguer, M., Simulation of climate change over Europe using a regional climate model.
