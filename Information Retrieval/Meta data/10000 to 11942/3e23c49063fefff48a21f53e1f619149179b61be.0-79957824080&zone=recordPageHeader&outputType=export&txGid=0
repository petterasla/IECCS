GHG emission factors of bioethanol derived from cassava, molasses, and sugar cane are analyzed using 12 scenarios covering the critical variables possibly affecting the GHG performance, i.e., (1) the possible direct land use change caused by expanding feedstock cultivation areas; (2) types of energy carriers used in ethanol plants; and (3) waste utilization, e.g., biogas recovery and dry distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) production. The assessment reveals that GHG performance of a Thai bioethanol system is inclined to decrease in the long run due to the effects from the expansion of plantation areas to satisfy the deficit of cassava and molasses. Therefore, bioethanol will contribute to the country's strategic plan on GHG mitigation in the transportation sector only if the production systems are sustainably managed, i.e., coal replaced by biomass in ethanol plants, biogas recovery, and adoption of improved agricultural practices to increase crop productivity without intensification of chemical fertilizers. Achieving the year 2022 government policy targets for bioethanol with recommended measures would help mitigate GHG emissions up to 4.6 Gg CO 2-eq per year. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Agricultural practices; Biogas recovery; Chemical fertilizers; Critical variables; Crop productivity; Energy carriers; Ethanol plants; GHG emission; GHG mitigation; Global warming impact; Government policy; Land-use change; Production system; Strategic plan; Thailand; Transportation sector; Bioethanol; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Coal transportation; Cultivation; Economics; Ethanol; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Global warming; Land use; Metal recovery; Sugar cane; Sugars; Greenhouse gases; alcohol; bioethanol; biogas; coal; fertilizer; molasses; unclassified drug; agricultural emission; agricultural practice; biofuel; biomass power; carbon dioxide; coal; crop plant; crop production; cultivation; emission inventory; ethanol; global warming; greenhouse gas; land use change; mitigation; plantation; policy approach; strategic approach; transportation system; agriculture; alcohol production; article; bioenergy; biomass; biomass production; carbon footprint; cassava; controlled study; crop production; distillation; dry distiller grain with soluble; energy conversion; energy transfer; environmental sustainability; grain; greenhouse effect; land use; life cycle assessment; livestock; nonhuman; plant; plantation; product recovery; recycling; strategic planning; sugarcane; Thailand; tillage; traffic and transport; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Biomass; Ethanol; Greenhouse Effect; Thailand; Thailand; Manihot esculenta; Saccharum",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; molasses, 68476-78-8; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Ethanol, 64-17-5",,,,"Escobar, J.C., Lora, E.S., Venturini, O.J., Yaez, E.E., Castillo, E.F., Almazan, O., Biofuels: Environment, technology and food security (2009) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev., 13, pp. 1275-1287; Zah, R., Ruddy, T.F., International trade in biofuels: An introduction to the special issue (2009) J.
