Through the use of a one-dimensional photochemical model, we investigate what effect such a program might have on global average stratospheric ozone. We find that while the warming produced by a single CO2 doubling (1 to 4°C) might be offset with ozone losses of less than 5%, any attempt to use carbonyl suflide as a permanent solution to global warming could result in depletion of global average ozone by 30% or more. We estimate that in order to achieve cooling of 4°C rainwater pH would fall to between 3.5 and 3.8. -Authors",,"carbonyl sulphide; global warming; photochemical model; stratospheric ozone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028869204
