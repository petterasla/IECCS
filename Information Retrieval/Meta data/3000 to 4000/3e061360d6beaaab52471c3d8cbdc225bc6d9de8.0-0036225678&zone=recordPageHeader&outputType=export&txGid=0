The majority of methane in nature is derived from acetate. Here we report the complete genome sequence of an acetate-utilizing methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A. Methanosarcineae are the most metabolically diverse methanogens, thrive in a broad range of environments, and are unique among the Archaea in forming complex multicellular structures. This diversity is reflected in the genome of M. acetivorans. At 5,751,492 base pairs it is by far the largest known archaeal genome. The 4524 open reading frames code for a strikingly wide and unanticipated variety of metabolic and cellular capabilities. The presence of novel methyltransferases indicates the likelihood of undiscovered natural energy sources for methanogenesis, whereas the presence of single-subunit carbon monoxide dehydrogenases raises the possibility of nonmethanogenic growth. Although motility has not been observed in any Methanosarcineae, a flagellin gene cluster and two complete chemotaxis gene clusters were identified. The availability of genetic methods, coupled with its physiological and metabolic diversity, makes M. acetivorans a powerful model organism for the study of archaeal biology.",,"ABC transporter; acetic acid; acetyl coenzyme A synthetase; acyltransferase; bacterial polysaccharide; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; catalase; corrinoid; cyanocobalamin; cytochrome c oxidase; cytochrome d; flagellin; flavoprotein; hydrogenase; membrane protein; methane; methyltransferase; nitrogenase; peptidase; permease; protein histidine kinase; protein subunit; superoxide dismutase; transposase; Archaebacterium; article; bacterial genome; bacterial growth; base pairing; chemotaxis; controlled study; energy resource; gene cluster; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic code; genetic procedures; genetic variability; methanogenesis; Methanosarcina; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; priority journal; unindexed sequence; Archaeal Proteins; Carbon Monoxide; Cell Movement; Euryarchaeota; Gene Expression Regulation, Archaeal; Genome, Archaeal; Hydrogen; Membrane Proteins; Methanosarcina; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Nitrogen Fixation; Oxygen; Polysaccharides; Protein Biosynthesis; Replication Origin; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic; Variation (Genetics); Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methanosarcina acetivorans; Prokaryota","GENBANK: AE010299; MA0144, MA0145, MA0146, MA0455, MA0456, MA0528, MA0529, MA0532, MA0533, MA0572, MA0779, MA0847, MA0859, MA0931, MA0932, MA0934, MA1011, MA1012, MA1013, MA1014, MA1015, MA1016, MA1309, MA1615, MA1616, MA1617, MA2163, MA2424, MA2425, MA2972, MA3282, MA3606, MA3607, MA3613, MA3791, MA3861, MA3862, MA3863, MA3864, MA3865, MA4164, MA4165, MA4355, MA4363, MA4379, MA4384, MA4391, MA4392, MA4399","Archaeal Proteins; Carbon Monoxide, 630-08-0; Hydrogen, 1333-74-0; Membrane Proteins; Oxygen, 7782-44-7; Polysaccharides",,,,"Baliga, N.S., Goo, Y.A., Ng, W.V., Hood, L., Daniels, C.J., DasSarma, S., Is gene expression in Halobacterium NRC-1 regulated by multiple TBP and TFB transcription factors?
