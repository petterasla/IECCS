However, biofuel production is subject to unpredictable external disturbances caused by demand variation, regional instability and extreme weather. It is highly desired to design a biofuel plant such that it has operational flexibility to survive through these disturbances. Gasification based thermo-chemical conversion is one of the promising approaches: the plant can produce a variety of products including electricity, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, and diesel while taking almost any kind of biomass as feedstock. In this paper, technical and economic performance of thermo-chemical biofuel plants is evaluated under external disturbances, including extreme weather, market fluctuation, and policy uncertainties. Four plant configurations with varying electricity generation capacity and different in-plant hydrogen production methods (methane autothermal reforming or water-gas shifting) are considered. It has been found that by providing additional electricity production capacity and producing hydrogen via methane reforming, the biofuel plant could have the best chance to maximize profit under external disturbances. Results from this research are expected to help relevant biofuel stakeholders, i.e. investors, plant managers, and government agencies, to make key decisions with regards to investment, plant operation, as well as policy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel production; Extreme weather; Market fluctuation; Operational flexibility; Subsidy policy","Autothermal reforming; Biofuel production; Demand variations; Economic performance; Electricity generation capacity; Electricity production; Energy security; External disturbances; Extreme weather; Government agencies; Hydrogen production method; Market fluctuations; Methane reforming; Operational flexibility; Plant managers; Plant operations; Product flexibility; Thermo-chemical; Thermochemical Conversion; Transportation sector; Water gas; Biofuels; Chemical analysis; Economic analysis; Electric generators; Electricity; Feedstocks; Global warming; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Investments; Liquefied petroleum gas; Methane; Profitability; Chemical plants; biofuel; biomass; diesel; economic analysis; electricity generation; global warming; hydrogen; methane; performance assessment; subsidy system; thermochemistry",,,,,,"(2009) Annual energy review, , 2010 ,US EIA; Stern, R.J., United States cost of military force projection in the Persian Gulf, 1976-2007 (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 2816-2825; Agrawal, R., Singh, N.R., Ribeiro, F.H., Delgass, W.N., Sustainable fuel for the transportation sector (2007) PNAS, 104, pp. 4828-4833; Curtis, B., (2010) 2008-2009 review: U.S. biofuels industry: mind the gap; Ajanovic, A., Biofuels versus food production: does biofuels production increase food prices?
