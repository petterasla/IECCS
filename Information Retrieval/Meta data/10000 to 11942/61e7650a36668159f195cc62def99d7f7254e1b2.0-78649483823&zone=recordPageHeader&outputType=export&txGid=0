The reduction of CO2 emission from coal-fired power plants is an important research issue in alleviating the global warming. The entire dynamics are decomposed in two main parts; fire-side dynamics and water-side dynamics. The fire-side dynamics consist of the mass and energy balance equations in the furnace (combustion process) and the flue gas dynamics represented by the mass balance equations of five gases (O2, CO2, SO2, H2O and NO2). The water-side dynamics include a drum pressure equation and a steam temperature equation. To validate the developed models, the real experimental data in Karakas, Koumanakos, et al. (2007) are used. To investigate the local behavior near an operating point, a linearization method at its steady-state condition is pursued. The time responses of the entire dynamics using step inputs (the oxygen mass flow rate, the coal mass flow rate, the primary air mass flow rate, etc.) are also discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Coal power plant; Mass and energy balance; Model validation; Modeling; Oxy-fuel combustion boiler; Simulation","Coal power plants; Mass and energy balance; Model validation; Modeling; Oxyfuel combustion; Simulation; Boilers; Coal; Coal industry; Coal research; Computer simulation; Dynamics; Energy balance; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Global warming; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Oxygen; Pipe flow; Coal combustion",,,,,,"Aström, K.J., Bell, R.D., Drum-boiler dynamics (2000) Automatica, 36 (3), pp. 363-378; Badzioch, S., Hawksley, G.W., Kinetics of thermal decomposition of pulverized coal particles (1970) Industrial Engineering and Chemical Process Design and Development, 9 (4), pp. 521-530; Buhre, B.J.P., Elliot, L.K., Sheng, C.D., Gupta, R.P., Wall, T.F., Oxy-fuel combustion technology for coal-fired power generation (2005) Journal of Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 31 (4), pp. 283-307; Chen, W., Smoot, L.D., Hill, S.C., Fletcher, T.H., Global rate expression for nitric oxide reburning.
