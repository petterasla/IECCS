The increase in CO 2 levels associated with global warming will increase the likelihood of carbonation-induced corrosion. Moreover, temperature rises will increase corrosion rates. Clearly, the impact of climate change on existing and new infrastructure is considerable, as corrosion damage is disruptive to society and costly to repair. The paper describes a probabilistic and reliability-based approach that predicts the probability of corrosion initiation and damage (severe cracking) for concrete infrastructure subjected to carbonation and chloride-induced corrosion resulting from elevated CO 2 levels and temperatures. The atmospheric CO 2 concentration and local temperature and relative humidity changes with time over the next 100 years in the Australian cities of Sydney and Darwin are projected based on nine General Circulation Models (GCMs) under (i) high CO 2 emission scenario, (ii) medium CO 2 emission scenario, and (iii) CO 2 emission reduction scenario based on policy intervention. The probabilistic analysis included the uncertainty of CO 2 concentration, deterioration processes, material properties, dimensions, and predictive models. It was found that carbonation-induced damage risks can increase by over 400% over a time period to 2100 for some regions in Australia. Damage risks for chloride-induced corrosion increase by no more than 15% over the same time period due to temperature increase, but without consideration of ocean acidity change in marine exposure. Corrosion loss of reinforcement is not significant. The results were most sensitive to increases in atmospheric CO 2. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Concrete; Corrosion; Risk; Structural reliability","Atmospheric CO; Australia; Chloride induced corrosion; Climate change impact; Corrosion damage; Corrosion initiation; Corrosion loss; Damage risks; Deterioration process; Elevated CO; Emission reduction; Emission scenario; General circulation model; Induced damage; Local temperature; Marine exposure; Material property; Policy intervention; Predictive models; Probabilistic analysis; Reinforcement corrosion; Structural reliability; Temperature increase; Temperature rise; Time-periods; United kingdom; Atmospheric humidity; Carbonation; Chlorine compounds; Deterioration; Global warming; Reinforcement; Reliability; Risks; Uncertainty analysis; Corrosion rate; carbon dioxide; climate change; concrete structure; corrosion; general circulation model; global warming; infrastructure; probability; risk assessment; Australia; Darwin; New South Wales; Northern Territory; Sydney [New South Wales]",,,,,,"Val, D., Stewart, M.G., Melchers, R.E., Effect of reinforcement corrosion on reliability of highway bridges (1998) Eng Struct, 20 (11), pp. 1010-1019; Stewart, M.G., Mullard, J.A., Spatial time-dependent reliability analysis of corrosion damage and the timing of first repair for RC structures (2007) Eng Struct, 29 (5), pp. 1457-1464; Akiyama, M., Frangopol, D.M., Yoshida, I., Time-dependent reliability analysis of existing RC structures in a marine environment using hazard associated with airborne chlorides (2010) Eng Struct, 32 (11), pp. 3768-3779; (2007) Fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel in climate change, , Cambridge University Press, UK, IPCC; Stewart, M.G., Rosowsky, D.V., Structural safety and serviceability of concrete bridges subject to corrosion (1998) J Struct Eng, ASCE, 4 (4), pp. 146-155; Sudret, B., Defaux, G., Pendola, M., Stochastic evaluation of the damage length in RC beams submitted to corrosion of reinforcing steel (2007) Civ Eng Environ Syst, 24 (2), pp. 165-178; (2006), Fib.
