Arid land and semi-arid land account for about one third of all land area and are characterized by extremely low productivity, which is mainly caused by low precipitation. In these areas, a considerable amount of rainwater is lost due to runoff and evaporation, but runoff water is available for tree growth when it is collected and allowed to penetrate into the deep root zone. Therefore, the selection of afforestation area suitable for effective use of rainfall/runoff water for tree growth is required for arid land afforestation. In this study, we constructed an original runoff model to represent water movement in a watershed area of several km by several km in an arid area of Western Australia. For numerical calculation with ten meter grids, the maximum required time difference value was determined to give negligibly small calculation errors. Suitable fitting parameters in our model were determined by comparing the numerical results with actual data of runoff behavior after rainfall. As a result, the water movement in the flow area could be expressed by our model calculation. © 2010 The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.","Afforestation; Arid land; Runoff; Simulation","Afforestation; Arid area; Arid lands; Atmospheric CO; Calculation error; Deep roots; Fitting parameters; Flow area; Land areas; Large-scale afforestation; Model calculations; Numerical calculation; Numerical results; Rainfall/runoff; Required time; Runoff model; Runoff water; Semi arid; Simulation; Tree growth; Water movements; Watershed areas; Western Australia; Arid regions; Global warming; Reforestation; Runoff",,,,,,"Chow, V.T., (1959) Open-channel Hydraulics, pp. 99-123. , McGraw-Hill, New York; Hamano, H., Takahashi, N., Yamada, K., Kojima, T., Law, J., The measurement of Runoff Ratio in the Middle Scale Watershed for Afforestation in the Arid Land (2010) Kagaku Kogaku Ronbunshu, , submitted; Horton, R.E., Analysis of Runoff-plat Experiment with Varying Infiltration-capacity, Trans (1939) American Geophsical Union, pp. 693-711; (2002) Terminological Dictionary of Soil Physics, 143, pp. 41-42. , Japanese Society of Soil Physics; Yoken-do, Tokyo; (1997) Hydrology and Water Resources Handbook, pp. 79-94. , Japan Society of Hydrology and Water Resources; Asakura Shoten, Tokyo; Jury, W.A., Horton, R., (2006), pp. 154-157. , (Translated and ed., N.
