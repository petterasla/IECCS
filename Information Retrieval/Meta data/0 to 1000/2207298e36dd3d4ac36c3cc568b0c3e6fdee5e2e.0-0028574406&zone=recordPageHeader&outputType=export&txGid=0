Signatures of CFC-11 are found to be grossly overestimated in regions of deep and bottom water formation, both in the surface mixed layer and at depth. In sensitivity experiments, we consider the effect of sea ice cover in limiting air-sea gas exchange in polar waters. It is found that bottom water in the Arctic Ocean and around the Antarctic continent is significantly reduced in CFC content once regions covered with sea ice are limited to fractional air-sea gas exchange. This more physically meaningful framework is found to further reduce the spurious uptake of CFC-11 and CFC-12 found under a ""saturated surface' assumption. The wind speed dependent gas forcing increases the surface CFC equilibration rate under the subpolar westerlies. Vertical convection of unstable waters acts as the efficient tracer ventilator of the ocean system. This has significant implications for numerical studies of the world's climate, since the meridional overturning has traditionally been considered the reason for the ocean's moderating influence during global warming scenarios. Our study suggests that the vertical convection would play a much greater role over the typical timescale for anthropogenic climate change. -from Authors",,"air-sea flux; air/sea gas exchange; CFC uptake; CFCs; gas exchange; gas forcing; sea ice cover; world ocean model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028574406
