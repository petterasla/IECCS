A high-latitude polar-night warming or a general night warming could be either benign or beneficial. A large number of plant species show both increased growth and greater water-use efficiency under enhanced carbon dioxide. Evidence now indicates that anthropogenerated sulfate emissions are mitigating some of the warming, and that increased cloudiness as a result of these emissions will further enhance night, rather than day, warming. The sulfate emissions, though, are not sufficient to explain all of the night warming. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide; global warming; threat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027072332
