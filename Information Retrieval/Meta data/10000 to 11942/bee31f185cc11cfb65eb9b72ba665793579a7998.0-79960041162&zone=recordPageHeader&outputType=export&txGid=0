The country has propelled itself to a position of leadership in clean energy and efficiency, for instance, with important consequences for public health. Objectives: We comment on China's challenges and recent accomplishments in addressing envi-ronmental problems from domestic pollution to global climate change. We compare China's commitment to clean energy technology with that of other leading nations and discuss key achievements in other areas, including vehicle efficiency standards and transportation policy. Discussion: We discuss policy directions that would secure much-needed improvements to environmental quality and health in China, along with actions that could motivate global action on issues of energy conservation and pollution reduction. Conclusions: A comprehensive regulatory and institutional framework for environmental policy is within reach in China but will require addressing major hurdles such as the lack of an independent monitoring mechanism and the need for greater transparency and enforcement in environmental matters. Meanwhile, China can continue to set important examples by investing in renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.","Climate change; Efficiency; Environmental policy; Pollution; Renewable energy; Transportation","article; China; climate change; energy conservation; energy resource; environmental health; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; pollution; priority journal; quality control; renewable energy; standardization; technology; China; Climate Change; Energy-Generating Resources; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution; Environmental Remediation",,,,,,"Alfsen, K., Hass, J., Tao, H., You, W., (2006) International Experiences with ""Green GDP"", , Oslo:Statistics Norway; Boden, T.A., Marland, G., Andres, R.J., (2010) Global, Regional, and National Fossil-Fuel CO2 Emissions, , Oak Ridge, TN:Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy; Campbell-Lendrum, D., Corvalan, C., Climate change and developing-country cities: Implications for environmental health and equity (2007) J Urban Health, 84 (3 SUPPL.), pp. i109-i117; Gleick, P., (2008) China and Water, pp. 79-100. , In: The World's Water 2008-2009: The Biennial Report on Freshwater Resources, Washington, DC:Island Press; (2004) Health Effects of Outdoor Air Pollution in Developing Countries of Asia: A Literature Review, , Health Effects Institute, Special Report 15, Boston, MA:Health Effects Institute; Hedley, A.J., Wong, C.M., Thach, T.Q., Ma, S., Lam, T.H., Anderson, H.R., Cardiorespiratory and all-cause mortality after restrictions on sulphur content of fuel in Hong Kong: An intervention study (2002) Lancet, 360 (9346), pp. 1646-1652; (2010) Datasheet of Global Passenger Vehicle Fuel Economy/GHG Regulations, , http://www.theicct.org/info/data/Global_PV_Std_Jan2011Update_datasheet.xlsx, International Council on Clean Transportation, Available, accessed 9 March 2011; (2010) Tracklaying Begins on Beijing-Shanghai HSL, , International Railway Journal, Falmouth, UK:Simmons-Boardman; Li, V., Lang, G., China's green GDP experiment and the struggle for ecological modernisation (2010) J Contemp Asia, 40 (1), pp. 44-62; Martinot, E., Li, J., China's latest leap: An update on renewables policy (2010) Renewable Energy World, 13 (4), pp. 51-57; Matthews, H.S., Lave, L.B., Applications of environmental valuation for determining externality costs (2000) Environ Sci Technol, 34 (8), pp. 1390-1395; (2009) Bulletin of China's Environmental Conditions, , Ministry of Environmental Protection, People's Republic of China, Beijing:Ministry of Environmental Protection; (2010) Science and Engineering Indicators, , National Science Board, Arlington, VA:National Science Foundation; Nordhaus, W., Kokkelenberg, E., (1999) Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment, , Washington, DC:National Academy Press; Norris, T., Shenai, N., Dynamic balances: American power in the age of innovation (2010) SAIS Rev Int Aff, 30 (2), pp. 149-164; (1989) Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, , http://english.mep.gov.cn/Policies_Regulations/laws/environmental_laws/200710/t20071009_109928.htm, NPC (National People's Congress), Available, accessed 17 May 2011; Oliver, H.H., Gallagher, K.S., Tian, D., Zhang, J., China's fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles: Rationale, policy process, and impacts (2009) Energy Policy, 37 (11), pp. 4720-4729; (2006) Environmental Compliance and Enforcement in China, , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, An Assessment of Current Practices and Ways Forward, Paris:OECD; Pacyna, E.G., Pacyna, J.M., Steenhuisen, F., Wilson, S., Global anthropogenic mercury emission inventory for 2000 (2006) Atmos Environ, 40 (22), pp. 4048-4063; (2010) Who's Winning the Clean Energy Race?
