A reduction in freezing temperature and an increase insoil moisture content caused a slight reduction in survival % for varietieswith excellent frost resistance and a great reduction for those with mediumor poor frost resistance. Predictions suggest that in Central Europe, as theresult of global climatic changes, there will be a reduction in the quantityof winter precipitation, a considerable rise in winter temperatures and anincrease in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Judging by the experimentalresults, these changes could improve the overwintering of winter cereals; atthe same time, however, a number of factors (mainly the reduction ofprecipitation) leading to yield losses must be expected during the vegetationperiod.","cereals; frost resistance; global warming; increased CO2; overwintering","Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Andrews, J.E., Controlled low temperature test of sprouted seeds as a measure of cold hardiness of winter wheat varieties (1958) Can J Plant Sci, 38, pp. 1-17; Andrews, C.J., Pomeroy, M.K., De La Roche, I.A., Changes in cold hardiness of overwintering winter wheat (1974) Can J Plant Sci, 54, pp. 9-15; Chen, C., Gusta, L.V., The role of water in cold hardiness of winter cereals (1978) Plant Cold Hardiness and Freezing Stress, pp. 165-174. , Academic Press; Czelnai, R., Harnos, Zs., Szász, G., Éghajlativáltozás és aszály (1994) MTA Aszálybizottság Jelentése, , in press; Gusta, L.V., Fowler, D.B., Effects of temperature on dehardening and rehardening of winter cereals (1976) Can J Plant Sci, 56, pp. 673-678; Houghton, R.A., Woodwell, G.M., Global climate change (1989) Sci Amer, 260, pp. 18-26; Kimball, B.A., Carbon dioxide and agricultural yield: An assemblage and analysis of 770 prior observations (1983) WCL Report 14, , Water Conservation Laboratory, Agricultural Research Service USDA, Phoenix, Arizona; Mitchell, R.C., Mitchell, V.J., Driscoll, S.P., Franklin, J., Lawlor, D.W., Effects of increased CO2 concentration and temperature on growth and yield of winter wheat at two levels of nitrogen application (1993) Plant, Cell & Environment, 16 (5), pp. 521-529; McKee, I.F., Woodward, F.I., The effect of growth at elevated CO2 concentrations on photosynthesis in wheat (1994) Plant, Cell & Environment, 17 (7), pp. 853-859; Nass, H.G., Relationship between plant water content and winter hardiness of winter wheat and fall rye grown in Atlantic Canada (1983) Can J Plant Sci, 63, pp. 67-71; Nicolas, M.E., Munns, R., Samarakoon, A.B., Gifford, R.M., Elevated CO2 improves the growth of wheat under salinity (1993) Australian J Plant Physiol, 20 (3), pp. 349-360; Olien, C.R., Freezing stresses and survival (1967) Ann Rev Plant Physiol, 18, pp. 387-408; Rajki, E., Winter hardiness.
