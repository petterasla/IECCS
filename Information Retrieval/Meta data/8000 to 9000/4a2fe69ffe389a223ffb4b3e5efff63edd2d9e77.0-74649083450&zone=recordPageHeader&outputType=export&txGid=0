In this study, detailed geochemical analysis has been carried out on Ganzisi loess-paleosol sequence in Ganzê County of western Sichuan Province. The results indicate that Ganzê loess and paleosol have experienced the incipient stage of chemical weathering in dust source regions, characterized by the decomposition of plagioclase which caused the depletion of mobile elements Na and Ca. The post-depositional chemical weathering is characterized by carbonate dissolution and oxidation of Fe2+. The variations of some geochemical indexes (such as CIA values, Na/K and Fe2+/ Fe3+ ratios) in Ganzisi loess-paleosol sequence indicate a gradually decreased chemical weathering intensity in the dust source regions and deposition areas since 1.15 Ma BP consistent with the general increase of global ice volume, reflecting that the arid trend since 1.15 Ma BP in the southeast Tibetan Plateau is a regional response to the global climate change. The geochemical indexes in this section also reveal an obvious drying step occurred at about 250 ka BP in this region. We interpret this drying step as a result of decreased influence of the Indian southwest summer monsoon. This decrease in monsoon moisture is probably attributable to the uplift of the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau at about 250 ka BP. © Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2009.","Chemical weathering; Garzê; Loess-paleosol sequence; Paleoclimate",,,,,,,"Jiang, F.C., Wu, X.H., Xiao, H.G., The Ganzi loess stratigraphy in the West Sichuan Plateau (in Chinese) (1997) Acta Geos Sin, 18, pp. 413-420; Pan, B.T., Wang, J.M., Loess record of Qinghai-Xizang Plateau Monsoon variations in the eastern part of the plateau since the last interglacial (in Chinese) (1999) Quat Sci, 4, pp. 330-335; Chen, S.Y., Fang, X.M., Wang, S.M., Relation between the loess stratigraphy on the eastern Tibetan Plateau and Indian monsoon (in Chinese) (2002) Mar Geol Quat Geol, 22, pp. 41-46; Chen, F.B., Gao, S.H., Chen, J.L., A preliminary study on Ganzi loess magnetostratigraphy (in Chinese) (1990) Chinese Sci Bull, 35, p. 1600; Fang, X.M., Chen, F.B., Shi, Y.F., Ganzi loess and maximum glaciation on the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau (in Chinese) (1996) Chinese Sci Bull, 41, pp. 1865-1867; Qiao, Y.S., Zhao, Z.Z., Wang, Y., Magnetostratigraphy and its paleoclimatic significance of a loess-soil sequence from Ganzi area, west Sichuan plateau (in Chinese) (2006) Quat Sci, 26, pp. 250-256; Qiao, Y.S., Liu, D.Y., Li, C.Z., Magnetostratigraphy of a loess-soil sequence in the garze area, western Sichuan (in Chinese) (2007) J Geomechan, 13, pp. 289-295; Fang, X.M., The origin and provenance of Malan loess along eastern margin of Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Pleteau and its adjacent area (in Chinese) (1995) Sci China Ser B, 38, pp. 876-887; Yan, M.D., Fang, X.M., Chen, S.Y., Pleistocene magnetic susceptibility and paleomagnetism of the Tibetan loess and its implication on large climatic change events (2001) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 44 (SUPPL.), pp. 227-232; Liu, T.S., (1985) Loess and the Environment (in Chinese), pp. 238-255. , Beijing: Science Press; Wen, Q.Z., (1989) Geochemistry of the Chinese Loess (in Chinese), pp. 23-63. , Beijing: Science Press; Chen, J., An, Z.S., Liu, L.W., Variations in chemical compositions of the eolian dust in Chinese Loess Plateau over past 2.5 Ma and chemical weathering in the Asian inland (2001) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 31, pp. 136-145; Gu, Z.Y., Lal, D., Liu, T.S., Five million year 10Be record in Chinese loess and red-clay: Climate and weathering relationships (1996) Earth Planet Sci Lett, 12, pp. 701-709; Guo, Z.T., Liu, T.S., Fedoroff, N., Climate extremes in loess of China coupled with the strength of deep-water formation in the North Atlantic (1998) Glob Planet Chang, 18, pp. 113-128; Gallet, S., Jahn, B.M., Torii, M., Geochemical characterization of the Luochuan loess-paleosol sequence, China, and paleoclimatic implications (1996) Chem Geol, 133, pp. 67-88; Gu, Z.Y., Ding, Z.L., Xiong, S.F., A seven million geochemical record from Chinese red-clay and loess-paleosol sequence: Weathering and erosion in northwestern China (in Chinese) (1999) Quat Sci, 4, pp. 357-363; Han, J.T., Fyfe, W.S., Longstaffe, F.T., Climatic implications of S5 paleosol complex on the southermost Chinese Loess Plateau (1998) Quat Res, 50, pp. 21-33; Chen, J., Ji, J.F., Qiu, G., Geochemical studies on the intensity of chemical weathering in Luochuan loess-paleosol sequence (1998) China.
