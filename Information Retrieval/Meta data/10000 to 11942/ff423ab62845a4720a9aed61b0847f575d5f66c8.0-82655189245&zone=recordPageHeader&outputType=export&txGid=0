Results show that there is a significant negative correlation between precipitation and temperature, indicating that precipitation influences temperature significantly: the more the precipitation, the lower the temperature, and vice versa. The precipitation effect on temperature can reasonably interpret the typical summer temperature in Southwest China and can partly explain why global warming is more significant in winter than in summer and more significant in higher latitude areas than in lower latitude. © 2011 China University of Geosciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","global warming; negative correlation; precipitation effect; temperature variation","global warming; precipitation assessment; summer; temperature effect; winter; China",,,,,,"Allan, R.P., Soden, B.J., Atmospheric Warming and the Amplification of Precipitation Extremes (2008) Science, 321 (5895), pp. 1481-1484; Bradley, R.S., Diaz, H.F., Eischeid, J.K., Precipitation Fluctuations over Northern Hemisphere Land Areas since the Mid-19th Century (1987) Science, 237 (4811), pp. 171-175; Carslaw, K.S., Harrison, R.G., Kirkby, J., Cosmic Rays, Clouds, and Climate (2002) Science, 298, pp. 1732-1736; Chapin III, F.S., Sturm, M., Serreze, M.C., Role of Land-Surface Changes in Arctic Summer Warming (2005) Science, 310 (5748), pp. 657-660; Charlson, R.J., Schwartz, S.E., Hales, J.M., Climate Forcing by Anthropogenic Aerosols (1992) Science, 255 (5043), pp. 423-430; Crowley, T.J., Burke, K.C., (1998) Tectonic Boundary Conditions for Climate Reconstructions, p. 285. , New York: Oxford University Press; Dai, A.G., Del Genio, A.D., Fung, I.Y., Clouds, Precipitation, and Temperature Range (1997) Nature, 386, pp. 665-666; Dai, A.G., Trenberth, K.E., Karl, T.R., Effects of Clouds, Soil Moisture, Precipitation and Water Vapor on Diurnal Temperature Range (1999) Journal of Climate, 12, pp. 2451-2473; Dickerson, R.R., Kondragunta, S., Stenchikov, G., The Impact of Aerosols on Solar Ultraviolet Radiation and Photochemical Smog (1997) Science, 278 (5339), pp. 827-830; Ding, Y.J., Dai, X., Temperature in China during the Last 100 Years (1994) Monthly Meteorology, 20, pp. 19-26; Duan, K.Q., Yao, T.D., Thompson, L.G., Response of Monsoon Precipitation in the Himalayas to Global Warming (2006) Journal of Geophysical Reseach, 111, pp. D19110; Giorgi, F., Bi, X.Q., Qian, Y., Direct Radiative Forcing and Regional Climatic Effects of Anthropogenic Aerosols Over East Asia: A Regional Coupled Climate-Chemistry/Aerosol Model Study (2002) Journal of Geophysical Research, 107 (D20), p. 4439; Giorgi, F., Bi, X.Q., Qian, Y., Indirect vs. Direct Effects of Anthropogenic Sulfate on the Climate of East Asia as Simulated with a Regional Coupled Climate-Chemistry/Aerosol Model (2003) Climatic Change, 58 (3), pp. 345-376; Hansen, J., Johnson, D., Lacis, A., Climate Impact of Increasing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (1981) Science, 213 (4511), pp. 957-966; Hays, J.D., Imbrie, J., Shackleton, N.J., Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages (1976) Science, 194 (4270), pp. 1121-1132; Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis (2007) Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Jones, P.D., Moberg, A., Hemispheric and Large-Scale Surface Air Temperature Variations: An Extensive Revision and an Update to 2001 (2003) Journal of Climate, 16, pp. 206-223; Jones, P.D., Parker, D.E., Osborn, T.J., Global and Hemispheric Temperature Anomalies-Land and Marine Instrumental Records (2006) Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change, pp. 603-608. , Oak Ridge, Tenn.: U.S. Department of Energy; Joos, F., Plattner, G.K., Stocker, T.F., Global Warming and Marine Carbon Cycle Feedbacks on Future Atmospheric CO2 (1999) Science, 284, pp. 464-467; Kerr, R.A., Global Warming is Changing the World (2007) Science, 316 (5822), pp. 188-190; Lu, A.G., Pang, D.Q., He, Y.Q., Regional Summer Temperature Decrease against Global Warming in China, Landform Effect?
