On the basis of anomaly field analysis for near-surface temperature in North Hemisphere it is concluded that the observed global low-frequency perturbations in atmosphere can be somewhat resulted from the Ocean contribution to large-scale redistribution of heat fluxes in the climatic system ocean-atmosphere-ground.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Correlation methods; Heat flux; Numerical analysis; Oceanography; Temperature distribution; Continents; Disturbances; Climate change",,,,,,,"Byshev, V.I.; Inst.
