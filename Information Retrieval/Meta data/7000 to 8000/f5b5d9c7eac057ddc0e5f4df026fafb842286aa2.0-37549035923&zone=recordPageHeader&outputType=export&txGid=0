Simulations were conducted for 17 locations in the southeastern United States with mean annual temperatures ranging from 13.1 to 19.4 °C. The LINKAGES stand growth model, modified to include the ""RothC"" soil C and soil N model, simulated tree growth and soil C status. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased cumulative cottonwood aboveground biomass in the three rotations from a site average of 106 to 272 Mg/ha in 21 years. The equivalent site averages for loblolly pine showed a significant increase from 176 and 184 Mg/ha in 25 years with fertilization. Location results, compared on the annual sum of daily mean air temperatures above 5.5 °C (growing-degree-days), showed contrasts. Loblolly pine biomass increased whereas cottonwood decreased with increasing growing-degree-days, particularly in cottonwood stands receiving N fertilization. The increment of biomass due to N addition per unit of control biomass (relative response) declined in both plantations with increase in growing-degree-days. Average soil C in loblolly pine stands increased from 24.3 to 40.4 Mg/ha in 25 years and in cottonwood soil C decreased from 14.7 to 13.7 Mg/ha after three 7-year rotations. Soil C did not decrease with increasing growing-degree-days in either plantation type suggesting that global warming may not initially affect soil C. Nitrogen fertilizer increased soil C slightly in cottonwood plantations and had no significant effect on the soil C of loblolly stands.","Carbon sequestration; Growing-degree-days; Nitrogen fertilization; Soil organic matter","Carbon; Cotton; Plants (botany); Soils; Carbon sequestration; Nitrogen fertilization; Soil organic matter; Biomass; aboveground biomass; carbon sequestration; coniferous tree; fertilizer application; global warming; growth modeling; modeling; nitrogen; plantation; soil carbon; temperature gradient; North America; United States; Pinus taeda; Populus; Populus deltoides",,,,,,"Aber, J.D., Melillo, J.M., Nitrogen immobilization in decaying hardwood leaf litter as a function of initial nitrogen and lignin content (1982) Can.
