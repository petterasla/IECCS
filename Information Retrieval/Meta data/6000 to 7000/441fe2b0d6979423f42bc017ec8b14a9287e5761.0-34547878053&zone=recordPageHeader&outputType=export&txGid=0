The changes in hydrological quantities are analyzed with respect to the increases expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) equation, which describes the rate of increase of a hydrological quantity per temperature increase. The column-integrated water vapor increases at a rate close to the C-C rate, which is expected if relative humidity remains nearly constant. The poleward moisture transport and the precipitation increase with temperature at a rate less than the C-C rate, with the precipitation increasing the least. In addition, the intermodel variance of poleward moisture transport and precipitation is explained significantly better when the zonal-mean zonal wind change as well as the temperature change is taken into account. The percent increase in precipitation per temperature increase is smallest during the warm season when energy constraints on the hydrological cycle are more important. In contrast to other hydrological quantities, the changes in evaporation in the extratropics are not explained well by the temperature or zonal wind change. Instead, a significant portion of the intermodel spread of evaporation change is linked to the spread in the poleward ocean heat transport change. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Global warming; Hydrology; Moisture; Precipitation (meteorology); Extratropical hydrological cycle; Zonal wind change; Climatology; air temperature; climate modeling; evaporation; global warming; heat transfer; hydrological cycle; hydrological response; moisture transfer; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; water vapor; zonal wind",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Ingram, W.J., Constraints on future changes in climate and the hydrological cycle (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 224-232; Betts, A.K., Climate-convection feedbacks: Some further issues - An editorial comment (1998) Climatic Change, 39, pp. 35-38; Boer, G.J., Climate change and the regulation of the surface moisture and energy budgets (1993) Climate Dyn, 8, pp. 225-239; Boer, G.J., Flato, G., Ramsden, D., A transient climate change simulation with greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing: Projected climate to the twenty-first century (2000) Climate Dyn, 16, pp. 427-450; Cess, R.D., Intercomparison and interpretation of climate feedback processes in 19 atmospheric general circulation models (1990) J.
