Global climate change has caused many people to consider ways of reducing greenhouse gases Renewable energy has become an essential feature in curtailing emission of Green House Gases, while meeting the demand for energy. This paper presents an innovation system framework for development and diffusion of renewable energy technologies. The framework is used to identify opportunities for small and medium enterprises in the renewable energy sector. A case study on a successful development, installation and implementation of solar thermal systems households in Calgary, Alberta, by an entrepreneurial firm, is also presented. © 2010.","Canada; Innovation systems; Policy; Solar thermal","Alberta; Calgary; Canada; Effective management; Energy systems; Entrepreneurial firms; Environmental awareness; Global climate changes; Innovation system; Innovation systems; Oil Prices; Policy; Renewable energies; Renewable energy sector; Renewable energy technologies; Small and medium enterprise; Solar thermal; Solar thermal systems; Energy policy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Innovation; Solar heating; Renewable energy resources; climate change; commercialization; demand analysis; energy policy; global climate; greenhouse gas; household energy; innovation; installation; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; Alberta; Calgary; Canada",,,,,,"St.Denis, G., Parker, P., Community energy planning in Canada: the role of renewable energy (2009) Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews, 13, pp. 2088-2095; Shum, K.L., Watanabe, C., An innovation management approach for renewable energy deployment- the case of solar photovoltaic technology (2009) Energy Policy, 37, pp. 3535-3544; Thompson, S., Duggirala, B., The feasibility of renewable energies at an off-grid community in Canada (2009) Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews, 13, pp. 2740-2745; Mokyr, J., Technologies and institutions (2002) Technological innovation and economic performance, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, B.
