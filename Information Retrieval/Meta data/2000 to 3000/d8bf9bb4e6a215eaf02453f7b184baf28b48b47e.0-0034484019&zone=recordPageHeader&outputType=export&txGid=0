Deserts respond to the climate change, meanwhile, they affect the climate with their feedback of peculiar environment during the respondence. Many researches on desert climate have been carried out at home and abroad. However, there is little research on the respondence and feedback of modern fixed, semi-fixed and mobile deserts in arid areas to the climate change, in which the factor analysis as well as the parameter changing effects is especially the difficult problem all along. In this note, the parameters of the respondence and feedback of Gurbantunggut Desert to the climate change are measured and analyzed, some variable parameters of water-heat exchange are obtained, and a numerical model of desertification is developed according to a series of climate change of about 40 years and the variable relations of meteorological and physical features of the sand surface in Gurbantunggut Desert.","Climate change; Gurbantunggut Desert; Numerical model; Respondence and feedback","article; China; desert climate; environmental temperature; feedback system; global climate; heat exchange; meteorology; sand; solar radiation",,,,,,"Jones, P.D., Hulme, M., Calculating regional climatic time series for temperature and precipitation: Methods and illustrations (1996) International J.
