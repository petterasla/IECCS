As the United Nation's four-hundred-page report, Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, documents, livestock production is now one of three most significant contributors to environmental problems, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions, land degradation, water pollution, and increased health problems. The paper draws on the UN report as well as a flurry of other recently published studies in order to demonstrate the effect of intensive livestock production on global warming and on people's health. The paper's goal is to outline the problems caused by intensive livestock farming and analyze a number of possible solutions, including legislative changes and stricter regulations, community mobilizing, and consumers choosing to decrease their demand for animal products. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Agriculture; Animals; Environment; Ethics; Farming; Livestock; Meat","agricultural production; developing world; environmental issue; global perspective; greenhouse gas; health impact; intensive agriculture; land degradation; legislative implementation; livestock farming; nature-society relations; trend analysis; United Nations; water pollution; Animalia",,,,,,"Aiken, W., Ethical issues in agriculture (1984) Earthbound: New Introductory Essays in Environmental Ethics, pp. 274-288. , In T.
