Following the U.S. EPA's PFC Emissions Vintage Model (PEVM), uncontrolled FC emissions are modeled as proportional to total manufactured layer area (TMLA) of silicon. FC emissions of World Semiconductor Council (WSC) charter member countries (Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the United States), which voluntarily committed in 1999 to lower FC emissions by 2010 to 10% of baseline year emissions, are modeled for the period 1995-2020. For this same period, emissions from Chinese manufacturers under alternative emission reduction scenarios are modeled. If Chinese manufacturers were to adopt a baseline year of 2005 and a reduction target of 10% below baseline year emissions to be achieved by 2020, emissions would be 3.4 MMTCO2eq, comparable to the similarly projected controlled emissions of an average WSC charter member country (=16.3/5 MMTCO2eq) in 2020. The relative stringency of the alternative reduction scenarios considered for China vary between 50 and 95% reduction compared to business as usual (BAU). This is comparable to the stringency of the WSC charter members' goals for which FC emission reduction technologies are currently available.","China; Climate change; Fluorinated compounds; Global warming; Greenhouse gas; Semiconductors; World Semiconductor Council","Arsenic compounds; Electric conductivity; Environmental Protection Agency; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Semiconducting silicon; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor device models; Semiconductor devices; Semiconductor materials; Silicon; Silicon compounds; China; Climate change; Fluorinated compounds; Greenhouse gas; Semiconductors; World Semiconductor Council; Alternative fuels; baseline conditions; climate change; emission control; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; modeling; semiconductor industry; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,,,,,"Bishop, M.W., (2004) Chips, Cheap Labor Bridging Taiwan Strait, , Asia Times; Bohr, M., A 30 Year Retrospective on Dennard's MOSFET Scaling Paper (2007) IEEE Solid State Circuits Society; Beu, Laurie, S., December 2, 2005.
