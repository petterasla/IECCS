Methane emissions were measured by a closed chamber method, in rice plots at three locations (Suwon, Iksan, and Milyang) with the single rice cropping system. All experimental data from 5 years of study were summarized and used for calculating nation-wide CH 4 emissions. Temperature, soil type, cultural practices, water management, organic matter management, and cultivar selection significantly affected the fluctuations of CH4 emissions. The two most promising mitigation options for reducing emissions were altered water management, in particular mid-season aeration by short-term drainage, and improved organic matter management, by promotion of aerobic degradation through composing or soil incorporation. Annual total CH4 emission in Korea changed from 410 Gg in 1990 to 339 Gg in 2000, due mainly to a decrease in the cultivated area of paddy rice. If we convert annual CH4 emission to Global Warming Potential as CO2 equivalent, it amounts to 7.1 M CO 2 tyr-1 of greenhouse gas emitted to the atmosphere in 2000 from the rice fields in Korea, which is just 5.3% of the annual CO 2 emission from the industry and energy sector. More importantly, the balance between CO2 uptake by photosynthesis and CO2 emission is positive (a net sink), so that rice culture actually has net benefits for the global atmospheric carbon issue. Further reductions in emission amounts, by following recommendations in this article, could make these benefits even greater.","Global warming potential; Methane emission; Methane inventory; Mitigation options","Cultivation; Global warming; Greenhouses; Methane; Photosynthesis; Soils; Water management; Environmental engineering; carbon dioxide; methane; organic matter; aeration; air pollution; article; atmospheric dispersion; calculation; composting; concentration (parameters); cropland; cropping system; cultivar; cultivated land; cultural factor; degradation; environmental temperature; evaluation; greenhouse effect; measurement; photosynthesis; rice; soil; soil treatment; South Korea; technique; water management; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Bacteria, Aerobic; Environmental Monitoring; Korea; Methane; Nitrogen; Oryza sativa; Seasons; Soil; Temperature; Water Supply",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; Air Pollutants; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Soil",,,,"(1992) Climate Change 1992, , The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment; Cambridge University Press: United Kingdom; 223 pp; Prather, M., Derwent, R., Enhalt, P., Fraser, P., Sanhueza, E., Zhou, X., Other trace gases and atmospheric chemistry (1995) Climate Change 1994, pp. 73-126. , Houghton, J.T., et al., Eds.; Cambridge University Press: United Kingdom; Van Amstel, A.R., Swart, R.J., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions: An introduction (1994) Fertil.
