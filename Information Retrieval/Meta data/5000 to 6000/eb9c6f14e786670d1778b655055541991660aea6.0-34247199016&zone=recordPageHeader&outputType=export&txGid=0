What can be the best use of AOGCMs for assessing the climate change in a particular region? The question is complicated by the consideration of intra-year month-to-month variability of a particular climate variable such as precipitation or temperature in a specific region. A maximum entropy method (MEM), which combines limited information with empirical perspectives, is applied to assessing the probability-weighted multimodel ensemble average of a climate variable at the region scale. The method is compared to and coupled with other two methods: the root mean square error minimization method and the simple multimodel ensemble average method. A mechanism is developed to handle a comprehensive range of model uncertainties and to identify the best combination of AOGCMs based on a balance of two rules: depending equally on all models versus giving higher priority to models more strongly verified by the historical observation. As a case study, the method is applied to a central US region to compute the probability-based average changes in monthly precipitation and temperature projected for 2055, based on outputs from a set of AOGCMs. Using the AOGCM data prepared by international climate change study groups and local climate observation data, one can apply the MEM to precipitation or temperature for a particular region to generate an annual cycle, which includes the effects from both global climate change and local intra-year climate variability. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Earth atmosphere; Entropy; Optimization; Precipitation (chemical); Probability; Thermal effects; Annual cycle; Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models (AOGCMs); Climate variability; Maximum entropy method (MEM); Climate change; atmosphere-ocean system; climate change; climate modeling; climate variation; entropy; global climate; precipitation (climatology); temperature; North America; United States",,,,,,"AchutaRao, (2004) An appraisal of coupled climate model simulations, , Bader D (ed) Livermore, California; Brekke, L., Miller, N., Bashford, K., Quinn, N., Dracup, J., Climate change impacts uncertainty for water resources in the San Joaquin river basin, California (2004) J Am Water Resour Assoc, 40 (1), pp. 149-164; Brooke, A., Kendrick, D., Meeraus, D., (1998) GAMS: A user's guide, , Scientific; Changnon, S., Hollinger, S., Problems in estimating impacts of future climate change on midwestern corn yields (2003) Clim Change, 58, pp. 109-118; Dessai, S., Lu, X., Hulme, M., Development of a simple probabilistic climate scenario generator for impact and adaptation assessments (2003) Geophys Res Abstr, 5. , 12547; De Fraiture, C., (2003) The use of entropy optimization principles in parameter estimation: Applications to global water and food modeling, p. 165. , PhD dissertation submitted to the Faculty of the Graduate School of the University of Colorado, Department of Civil Environmental Architectural Engineering, Colorado, p; Giorgi, F., Mearns, L., Calculation of average, uncertainty range, and reliability of regional climate changes from AOGCM simulations via the ""Reliability Ensemble Averaging"" (REA) method (2002) J Climate, 15 (10), pp. 1141-1158; Giorgi, F., Mearns, L., Probability of regional climate change based on the Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) method (2003) Geophys Res Lett, 30 (12), p. 1629; Golan, A., Judge, G., Miller, D., (1996) Maximum entropy econometrics: Robust estimation with limited data, , Wiley, New York; Hu, Q., Buyanovsky, G., (2003) Climate effects on corn yield in Missouri, 42, pp. 1626-1635; Emissions scenarios (2000) Special report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, , IPCC-ES , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England; Jaynes, E., Where do we stand on maximum entropy?
