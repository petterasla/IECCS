The experiments were conducted on 4 vine varieties, Feteascǎ albǎ, Feteascǎ neagrǎ, Feteascǎ regalǎ and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown in the vineyard center Iasi, Experimental Farm of University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Romania, during 2007 - 2009. Temperature and rainfall were recorded by decade during the period from spring to autumn, and the values of mean temperatures and the sum of monthly rainfall were related to mean multiannual temperatures. The evolution of temperature and rainfall in the growing season of the grapevine showed the occurrence of the global warming phenomenon, represented by the appearance of drought in 2007 and 2009. In 2007, the drought was caused by an excessive overheating during the summer, with an increase of the monthly average temperature with up to +4.6°C and the daily temperature, which frequently exceeded +40°C. In 2009, the drought was caused by a severe deficit of rainfall, which represents only 55.6% of the multi-annual average value. The ecophysiological response of grape vine varieties was estimated by determination of visible and near UV light absorption capacity of leaf acetone extracts (1%). The a 663-664 nm chlorophyll may assess the intensity of photosynthesis in the response centre, while a 431-432 nm and b 453 nm chlorophyll may evaluate the light absorption capacity in the light absorption centre of photosynthetic systems; the flavonoid pigments with near UV absorption (321-322 nm) may evaluate the plant response to different factors of climate stress. The comparative study of leaf pigment contents of vegetative and flower shoots may evaluate the various mechanisms controlling plant growth, fructification and stress resistance. Under overheating conditions of 2007, the French variety Cabernet Sauvignon and the Romanian Feteascǎ neagrǎ had the highest photosynthetic intensity and capacity of light absorption. Under conditions of severe water shortage of 2009, Cabernet Sauvignon reacted by reducing the photosynthetic intensity and the intensification of light absorption, while the autochthonous varieties showed a more balanced behaviour. The content of flavonoid pigments was highly reduced at all varieties because of the water shortage. The red varieties of Feteascǎ neagrǎ and Cabernet Sauvignon reacted to severe water shortage by reducing the intensity of photosynthesis, and by increasing the capacity of light absorption in the leaves of the vegetative shoots compared to floriferous ones especially during the ripening period. Water deficit in 2009 reduced flavonoid pigment content in leaves in all studied varieties compared to 2008.","Ecophysiological response; Ecophysiology; Grape vine; Photosynthetic pigments; Vineyard","flavonoid; pigment; rain; article; autumn; climate change; controlled study; cultivar; drought; ecophysiology; flower; fruit ripening; fruiting; grape; greenhouse effect; heating; light absorption; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant leaf; plant stress; seasonal variation; shoot; spring; summer; temperature; temperature dependence; ultraviolet radiation; varietas; vineyard; water supply; weather; Vitaceae; Vitis",,,,,,"Acevedo, C.O., Ortega-Farias, S., Hidalgo, C.A., Investigaciónefecto de diferentes niveles de agua aplicada en pascuaja y en pospinta sobre la calidad del vino cv (2005) Cabernet Sauvignon.
