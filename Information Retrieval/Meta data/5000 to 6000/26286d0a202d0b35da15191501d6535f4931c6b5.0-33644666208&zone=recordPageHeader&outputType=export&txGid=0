Perturbed (2070-2100) and current (1961-2000) climates are compared using the model in time-slice mode. The model is forced by global sea surface temperatures provided by two transient scenarios performed with low-resolution coupled models and by two GHG evolution scenarios, SRES-A2 and SRES-B2. Comparing to reanalysis and observed data sets, the model is able to reproduce a realistic seasonal cycle of WAM despite a clear underestimation of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) during the boreal summer. Mean temperature change indicates a global warming over the continent (stronger over North and South Africa). Simulated precipitation change at the end of the twenty-first century shows an increase in precipitation over Sudan-Sahel linked to a strong positive feedback with surface evaporation. Along Guinea Gulf coast, rainfall regimes are driven by large-scale moisture advection. Moreover, results show a mean precipitation decrease (increase) in the most (less) enhanced GHG atmosphere over this region. Modification of the seasonal hydrological cycle consists in a rain increase during the monsoon onset. There is a significant increase in rainfall variance over the Sahel, which extends over the Guinea coast region in the moderate emission scenario. Enhanced precipitation over Sahel is linked to large-scale circulation changes, namely a weakening of the AEJ and an intensification of the Tropical Easterly Jet. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"aerosol; climate change; greenhouse gas; monsoon; Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",,,,,,"Bader, J., Latif, M., The impact of decadal-scale Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies on Sahelian rainfall and the North Atlantic Oscillation (2003) Geol Res Lett, 30 (22), p. 2169; Brovkin, V., Climate-vegetation interaction (2002) J Physique, 4, pp. 57-72; Charney, J.G., Shukla, J., Predictability of monsoons (1981) Monsoon Dynamics, pp. 99-110. , Lighthill J, Pearce RP (eds) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Claussen, M., Brovkin, V., Ganopolski, A., Kubatzki, C., Petoukhov, V., Climate Change in northern Africa: The past is not the future (2003) Climatic Change, 57 (1-2), pp. 99-118; Cubasch, U., Waszkewitz, J., Hegerl, G., Perlwitz, J., Regional climate changes as simulated in time-slice experiments (1995) Climate Change, 31, pp. 273-304; Douville, H., Planton, S., Royer, J.F., Stephenson, D.B., Tyteca, S., Kergoat, L., Lafont, S., Betts, R.A., The importance of vegetation feedbacks in doubled-CO2 time slice experiments (2000) J Geophys Res, 105 (14), pp. 841-861; Folland, C.K., Palmer, T.N., Parker, D.E., Sahel rainfall and worldwide sea surface temperature 1901-1985 (1986) Nature, 320, pp. 602-607; Folland, C.K., Karl, T., Vinnikov, K.Y., Climate change 1992 (1992) The IPCC Supplementary Report, p. 200. , Houghton JT, BA Callander, SK Varney (eds) Cambridge University.
