Modeling carbon footprints based on life cycle assessment is applied as a way to evaluate the net contribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from orchard production systems over one growing year. This net balance approach considers the sources and sinks of carbon and therefore provides a better reflection of an orchard system's net contribution to climate change. Carbon footprinting of organic kiwifruit and apple production systems in New Zealand indicated that the studied systems had a net sequestration from 2.4 to 5 t of CO2e/ha/year and therefore can be potentially considered as carbon sinks under the Kyoto Protocol. This finding implies that the organic kiwifruit and apple orchardist can gain a monetary benefit by earning carbon credits. However, further research to improve and validate this approach is essential before it can be practically used for decision-making at the orchard level and for policymaking at the national level.","Carbon footprinting; Carbon trading; Lca; Organic orchard systems","Actinidia deliciosa; Malus x domestica",,,,,,"Audsley, E., Harmonisation of Environmental Life Cycle Assessment For Agriculture (No. Concerted Action AIR3-CT94-2028) (1997), Silsoe Research Institute, Silsoe, UKPAS 2050: Specification For the Assessment of the Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Goods and Services (2008), http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/carbon/briefing/premeasurement.htm, BSI, 15 Mar. 2009Apple rootstock fact sheets (2007), http://www.hortnet.co.nz/publications/proceedings/enzafd99/enza-01.htm, Cornell University, 6 JanDalgaard, T., Halberg, N., Porter, J.R., A model for fossil energy use in Danish agriculture used to compare organic and conventional farming (2001) Agr.
