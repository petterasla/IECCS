About half the current cooling need of buildings in Europe is met by room air-conditioners - the rest being met by central systems. The likely market growth for such products over the next 25 years is assessed along with the consequent environmental impacts and the scope for reducing the global warming impacts by the use of 'best available' or 'least life cycle-cost' technologies. The analysis concludes that continuing growth of the room air-conditioners is likely over several decades, with resultant increases in environmental impacts if product design and use remain unchanged. However, Japanese experience shows that the energy-related environmental impacts could be considerably reduced without going beyond proven technology. Life cycle costing analysis suggests that the economically optimum performance lies between current European and current Japanese practice. Many room air-conditioners also provide carbon-efficient heating which can mitigate the impacts on greenhouse gas emissions.","Air-conditioning; Consumerism; Electrical appliances; Energy; Environmental impact; European regulation; Trends","Consumerism; Electrical appliances; Energy; European regulation; Trends; Air conditioning; Cooling; Cooling systems; Cost reduction; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Product design; Environmental impact",,,,,,"Adnot, J., Waide, P., Riviere, P., Energy Efficiency and Certification of Central Air Conditioners (2003), http//www.cep.ensmp.fr/english/themes/mde/pdf/EECCACfinalvol1.pdf, Final Report, April, available atBass, F.
