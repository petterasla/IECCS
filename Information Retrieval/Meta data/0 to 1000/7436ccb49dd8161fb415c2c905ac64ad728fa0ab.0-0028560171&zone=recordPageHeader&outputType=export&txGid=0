Two climate change experiments were conducted: one for a 2 × CO2 climate (representing a 4.2°C global warming) and one for a 2% decrease in the solar constant (representing a 5.9°C global cooling). The results suggest a 30% increase in global lightning activity for the warmer climate and a 24% decrease in global lightning activity for the colder climate. -from Authors",,"climate change; general circulation model; lightning distribution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028560171
