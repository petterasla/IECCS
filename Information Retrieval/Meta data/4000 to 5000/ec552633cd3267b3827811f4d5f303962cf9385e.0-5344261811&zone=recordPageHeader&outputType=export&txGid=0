Thus, to predict vegetation dynamics under climate change, it is necessary to understand how plant pathogens and herbivores will respond. Pathogens and herbivores are predicted to increase under climate warming because the amount of time available for growth and reproduction will increase. To test this prediction, we used a warming experiment in which heaters were suspended over a natural montane meadow for 12 years. In the summer of 2002, we quantified damage by all the observable (aboveground) pathogens and herbivores on six of the most common plant species (Artemisia tridentata, Helianthella quinquenervis, Erigeron speciosus, Potentilla gracilis, Potentilla hippiana, and Lathyrus leucanthus). We found that plants in the earlier melting plots generally had the most damage and were attacked by a larger number of species, which is consistent with predictions. However, although the overall trend was an increase in damage with warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt, some pathogens and herbivores performed better in cooler or later melting plots. The idiosyncratic response of each species to environmental conditions suggests that there are likely to be changes in community composition as the planet warms.","Artemisia tridentata; Climate change; CO 2; Erigeron speciosus; Global warming; Helianthella quinquenervis; Herbivory; Lathyrus leucanthus; Plant pathogens; Potentilla gracilis; Potentilla hippiana; Sagebrush","climate change; community composition; global warming; herbivore; pathogen; Artemisia; Artemisia tridentata; Erigeron; Erigeron speciosus; Helianthella; Helianthella quinquenervis; Lathyrus; Lathyrus lanszwertii leucanthus; Potentilla; Potentilla gracilis; Potentilla hippiana; Tridentata",,,,,,"Agrios, G.N., (1997) Plant Pathology, , Academic Press, San Diego, California, USA; Anderson, M.J., Gribble, N.A., Partitioning the variation among spatial, temporal and environmental components in a multivariate data set (1998) Australian Journal of Ecology, 23, pp. 158-167; Ayres, M.P., Plant defense, herbivory, and climate change (1993) Biotic Interactions and Climate Change, pp. 75-94. , P.
