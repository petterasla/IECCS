First results show that these measures reduce the linear erosion by approximately 50%. In addition, a retention pond has been constructed at the outlet of a first-order catchment to allow sedimentation of soil particles from other sources in the watershed. Depending on the characteristics of the runoff events this measure prevents 40% to 90% of the suspended matter from entering the receiving watercourse. Applying this system of conservation measures reduces the total sediment yield from the investigation area on the average by 65%. -from Authors",,"sediment yield; soil conservation; thalweg; Germany, Kraichgau",,,,,,,,"Wicherek S.",,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027830972
