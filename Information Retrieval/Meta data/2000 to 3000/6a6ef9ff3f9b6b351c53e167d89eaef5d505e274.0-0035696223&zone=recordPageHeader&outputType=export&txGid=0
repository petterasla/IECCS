Environmental aspects such as global warming potential, ozone depletion potential, recycling loss and toxicity are discussed. Insulation characteristics of gas mixtures such as c-C4F8/N2, c-C4F8/air, and c-C4F8/CO2 are examined experimentally under a quasi-homogeneous or an inhomogeneous electric field condition. Most of the characteristics are compared with those of SF6/N2, which is now widely studied as the most plausible alternative to pure SF6 for gas insulation. The experimental results, together with the discussion, suggest that gas mixtures containing c-C4F8 are possible substitutes for SF6 and SF6/N2.",,"Electric field effects; Fluorocarbons; Gases; Global warming; Ozone; Toxicity; Gas insulated system; Ozone depletion potential; Perfluorocyclobutane; Recycling loss; Sulfur hexafluoride; Electric insulating materials",,,,,,"Christophorou, L.G., Olthoff, J.K., Green, D.S., Gases for electrical insulation and arc interruption: Possible present and future alternatives to pure SF6 (1997), NIST Technical Note 1425Christophorou, L.G., Olthoff, J.K., Green, D.S., A search for possible ""Universal Application gas mixture"" (1998) Gaseous Dielectrics, 8, pp. 361-366; SF6 recycling guide; standards for handling SF6 gas in power industry (1998) Denki-Kyoto-Kenkyu, 54. , Edited by Electric Technology Research Association; (Electric Cooperative Research); (in Japanese); Takuma, T., Hamada, S., Yamamoto, O., Application of a gas mixture with c-C4F8 in gas insulation Proceedings of 11th Intel.
