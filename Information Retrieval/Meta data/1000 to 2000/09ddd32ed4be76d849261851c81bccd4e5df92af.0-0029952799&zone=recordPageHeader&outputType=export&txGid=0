Measurements were performed for four-year-old seedlings in CO2-air mixtures of 175, 350, 700 and 900 μol mol-1, respectively, with photosynthetic irradiance (I) decreasing gradually from 1200 μmol m-2 s-1 to darkness, and at 25 ± 0.2 °C leaf temperature and 1.8 ± 0.2 kPa leaf to air vapour pressure deficit. The CO2 concentrations strongly stimulated net photosynthetic rate, PN (p &lt; 0.001), and the photosynthetic efficiency, α, for both F. crenata and Q. crispula. Carboxylation efficiency of Q. crispula was dependent on I, with a significantly higher efficiency of CO2 utilization at an I of 1200 than of 500 μmol m-2 s-1. A decrease in I from 1200 to 500 μmol m- 2 s-1, however, did not prevent a curvilinear increase in P(N) at increased CO2 concentrations. In contrast, F. crenata seedlings showed less difference in P(N) between low-I and high-I environments. Nonetheless, F. crenata showed a greater CO2 response, with α increased by 25 % from 350 to 700 μmol(CO2) mol-1, α of Q. crispula, however, increased by less than 20 % as CO2 concentration increased from 350 to 700 μmol mol-1. The higher P(N) at high CO2 concentration under low I was attributed to the CO2 concentration accompanied by a significant decrease in compensation irradiance. These results suggest that the continuous increase in global CO2 concentrations will directly result in an increase in photosynthetic efficiencies of both F. crenata and Q. crispula. The competitive relationship between the two species will change if a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration occurs by the mid of the 21st century, with F. crenata benefiting more from CO2 fertilization than Q. crispula.","carboxylation efficiency; CO2 compensation concentration; irradiance; net photosynthetic rate; photosynthetic efficiency","Fagus; Fagus crenata; Quercus; Quercus crispula",,,,,,"Arp, W.J., Effects of source-sink relations on photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 (1991) Plant Cell Environ., 14, pp. 869-875; Baker, J.T., Allen Jr., L.H., Boote, K.J., Growth and yield responses of rice to carbon dioxide concentration (1990) J.
