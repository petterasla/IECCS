The refrigeration and air-conditioning industry, due to its reliance on CFCs and HCFCs, has invested in research in alternatives to the industry standard vapor compression machines. One alternative technology with great promise is chemical absorption. Absorption chillers offer comparable refrigeration output with reduced SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions. Absorption chillers do not use CFCs or HCFCs, refrigerants that contribute to ozone depletion and global warming. Additionally, gas-fired absorption chillers can save significant amounts in energy costs when used in combination with a vapor compression chiller in a hybrid system. The hybrid system can take advantage of the comparatively low price of natural gas (per unit ton) and rely on the high performance of vapor compression when electricity prices are lower. The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction for those new to absorption technology as well as a discussion of selected high efficiency cycles, a discussion on the technology of coupling absorption with vapor compression systems to form a hybrid system, and the environmental impacts of absorption.",,"Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas absorption; Global warming; Ozone; Gas fired absorption; Ozone depletion; Refrigerating machinery",,,,,,"(1988) ASHRAE Handbook, Equipment, Chapter 13, Absorption Cooling, Heating, and Refrigeration Equipment; Herold, K.E., Radermacher, R., Klein, S.A., (1996) Absorption Chillers and Heat Pumps, , CRC Press; (1997) ASHRAE Handbook, Fundamentals, Chapter 1, Thermodynamic and Refrigeration Cycles; Whitlow, G., (1994), Personal communication October 4Alefeld, G., Multi-Stage Apparatus Having Working-Fluid and Absorption Cycles, and Method of Operation Thereof, U.S. Patent 4,531,374, July 30, 1985Oouchi, T., Usui, S., Fukuda, T., Nishiguchi, A., Multi-Stage Absorption Refrigeration System, U.
