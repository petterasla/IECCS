The fear over global warming and CO2 emissions has drastically increased the worldwide awareness of this critical problem. The conversion of biomass into fuel is one of the most promising technologies to replace fossil fuels as a main energy source, particularly for transportation. Although food crops such as corn and soybeans have been successfully used to create bioethanol and biodiesel, the use of food crops and viable farmland is not really a sustainable long-term solution. A great deal of research is being funded to investigate alternative sources of biomass that can be economically converted into fuel. Algae and other aquatic species appear to be one of the most promising sources for the large quantities of biomass required for a successful biofuels program. The concept of producing biofuels from algae is not a recent idea and government funding for this research has been significant. A report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Golden, Colorado) provides an excellent background in this area, describing research that started in 1978 and extended over 20 years (1). One reason for the interest in algae as a source of biodiesel is that CO2 and a source of nutrients are required for biomass production. In one scenario, large algae ""farms"" are positioned near power plants or incinerators to convert their waste CO 2 into biomass. Waste-treatment facilities also could provide most of the required nutrients. © 2011 Advanstar Communications Inc.",,"Alternative source; Aquatic species; Biomass productions; Chemical compositions; Critical problems; Energy source; Food crops; Government funding; Long-term solutions; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; New energy sources; Algae; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biomass; Crops; Energy conversion; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Global warming; Nutrients; Research; Waste treatment; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Sheehan, J., Dunahay, T., Benemann, J., Roessler, P., (1998) A Look Back at the U.S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program-Biodiesel from Algae, , NREL/TP-580-24190; Lowry, S.R., (1998) Cellular and Molecular Biology, 44, pp. 169-177; Naumann, D., Helm, D., Labischinski, H., (1991) Nature, 351, pp. 81-82; Stehfest, K., Toepel, J., Wilhelm, C., (2005) Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 43, pp. 717-726; Dean, A.P., Martin, M.C., Sigee, D.C., (2005) Phycologia, 46, pp. 151-159; Wetzel, D.L., Eilert, A.J., Pietrzak, L.N., Miller, S.S., Sweat, J.A., (1998) Cellular and Molecular Biology, 44, pp. 145-168; Pistorius, A.M., DeGrip, W.J., Egorova-Zachernyuk, T.A., (2009) Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 103, pp. 123-129; Mossoba, M.M., Khambaty, F.M., Fry, F.S., (2002) Applied Spectroscopy, 56, pp. 732-736","Lowry, S.; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States",,,,,,,,08876703,,SPECE,,"English","Spectroscopy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876487307
