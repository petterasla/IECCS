Wild onion, Allium macropetalum, failed to establish in plots receiving 25 mm month -1 simulated rainfall. The perennial composite, Bahia absinthifolia, occurred at higher densities in plots that were not irrigated but there were no differences in biomass in any of the irrigation or fertilization treatments. Desert holly, Perezia nana, failed to establish in nitrogen fertilized plots and developed higher abundance and biomass in plots receiving 25 mm month -1. Nitrogen fertilization had either no effect or an adverse effect on the perennial herbs. The tussock grass, Dasychloa pulchella exhibited highest abundance and biomass with 6 mm week -1 added water plus nitrogen. Since global climate change will affect both rain storm frequency and size and atmospheric nitrogen deposition, the results of this study are applicable to understanding vegetation responses climate change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Abundance; Biomass; Fertilization; Irrigation","abundance; atmospheric deposition; climate change; desert; experimental study; fertilizer application; global climate; growth rate; growth response; herb; monocotyledon; nitrogen; perennial plant; phytomass; rainfall; storm; tussock grassland; Chihuahuan Desert; Acourtia nana; Allium cepa; Allium macropetalum; Allium sativum; Bahia absinthifolia; Ilex",,,,,,"Charley, J.L., West, N.E., Plant-induced chemical patterns in of some shrub dominated semi-desert ecosystems of Utah (1975) Journal of Ecology, 63, pp. 945-964; Ettershank, G., Ettershank, J., Bryant, M., Whitford, W.G., Effects of nitrogen fertilization on primary production in a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem (1978) Journal of Arid Environments, 1, pp. 135-139; Fisher, F.M., Whitford, W.G., Field simulation of wet and dry years in the Chihuahuan Desert: soil moisture, N mineralization and ion-exchange resin bags (1995) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 20, pp. 137-146; Fisher, F.M., Zak, J.C., Cunningham, G.L., Whitford, W.G., Water and nitrogen effects on growth and allocation patterns of creosotebush in the northern Chihuahuan Desert (1988) Journal of Range Management, 41, pp. 387-391; Garcia-Moya, E., McKell, C.M., Contribution of shrubs to the nitrogen economy of a desert-wash plant community (1970) Ecology, 51, pp. 81-88; Garner, W., Steinberger, Y., A proposed mechanism for the formation of "" Fertile Islands"" in the desert ecosystem (1989) Journal of Arid Environments, 16, pp. 257-262; Gutierrez, J.R., Whitford, W.G., Responses of Chihuahuan Desert herbaceous annuals to rainfall augmentation (1987) Journal of Arid Environments, 12, pp. 127-139; Huxman, T.E., Snyder, K.A., Tissue, D., Leffler, A.J., Ogle, K., Pockman, W.T., Sandquist, D.R., Swinning, S., Precipitation pulses and carbon fluxes in semiarid and arid ecosystems (2004) Oecologia, 141, pp. 254-268; Kearney, T.H., Peebles, R.H., (1960) Arizona Flora, , University of California Press, Berkeley; Noy-Meir, E., Desert ecosystems: environments and producers (1973) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 5, pp. 195-214; Reynolds, J.F., Kemp, P.F., Ogle, K., Fernandez, R.J., Modifying the 'pulse-reserve' paradigm for deserts of North America: precipitation pulses, soil water, and plant responses (2004) Oecologia, 141, pp. 194-210; Schlesinger, W.H., Raikes, J.A., Hartley, A.E., Cross, A.F., On the spatial pattern of soil nutrients in desert ecosystems (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 364-374; Schwinning, S., Sala, O.E., Heirarchy of responses to resource pulses in arid and semiarid ecoystems (2004) Oecologia, 141, pp. 211-220; Sponseller, R.A., Precipitation pulses and soil CO2 flux in a Sonoran Desert ecosystem (2007) Global Change Biology, 13, pp. 426-436; Steel, R.G.D., Torrie, J.H., (1980) Principles and Procedures of Stastics, , McGraw-Hill Book Co., N.Y; Stephens, G., Whitford, W.G., Responses of Bouteloua eriopoda to irrigation and nitrogen fertilization in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland (1993) Journal of Arid Environments, 24, pp. 415-421; Tongway, D., Whitford, W.G., Desertification and soil processes in rangelands (2002) Global Rangelands: Progress and Prospects, pp. 55-62. , CABI Publishing, Wallingford, Oxon, A.C.
