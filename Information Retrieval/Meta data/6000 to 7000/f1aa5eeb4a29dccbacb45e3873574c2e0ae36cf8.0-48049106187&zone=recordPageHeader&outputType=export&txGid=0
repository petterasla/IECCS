The results indicate that while the average number of extreme high temperature events per year has been increased in the last 50 years, the extreme low temperature events decreased. Except for some stations located in southwest China, the frequency of extreme low temperature events in most regions over China decreased. The spatial pattern of transition of frequency of extreme high temperature events showed decreased in southeast coastal regions and increase in inland regions.","Extreme events; Global warming; Median; Trend",,,,,,,,"Zhang, D.-Q.; College of Physics Science and Technology, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China; email: z_daquan@126.com",,,,,,,,10003290,,WLHPA,,"Chinese","Wuli Xuebao",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-48049106187
