The correct decision rule depends on whether: (1) the observed state of an ecosystem service (x) is non-stochastic or stochastic; (2) the true state of the ecosystem service (y) is non-stochastic or stochastic; and (3) the relationship between x and y is deterministic, stochastic, or uncertain. Crisp and probability-based decision rules are not appropriate when the relationship between y and x is uncertain in the sense that the decision maker is unable or unwilling to specify conditional probabilities of y given x. Under these conditions, a fuzzy decision rule is appropriate. A hypothetical case study is used to illustrate how a fuzzy decision rule is used to test hypotheses about whether selective cutting of timber provides greater or less forest biodiversity than clearcutting of timber. The case study describes how to incorporate the decision rule in an active adaptive management framework to sequentially test the extent to which changes over time in other factors influencing ecosystem services, such as greater spread of invasive species due to global warming, alter the efficacy of timber management practices. The fuzzy adaptive management decision rule can be generalized to account for the effects of management practices on multiple ecosystem services. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive management; Fuzzy logic; Natural systems","Adaptive Management; Conditional probabilities; Decision makers; Decision rules; Ecosystem services; Forest biodiversity; Fuzzy adaptive; Fuzzy decision rules; Invasive species; Management practices; Natural systems; Selective cutting; Timber management; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Fuzzy logic; Global warming; Probability; Stochastic systems; Timber; Decision making",,,,,,"Barrett, C.R., Pattanaik, P.K., Fuzzy sets, preference and choice: some conceptual issues (1989) Bulletin of Economic Research, 41, pp. 229-253; Baas, S.M., Kwakernaak, H., Rating and ranking of multiple-aspect alternatives using fuzzy sets (1977) Automatica, 13, pp. 47-58; Bellman, R.E., Zadeh, L.A., Decision-making in a fuzzy environment (1970) Management Science, 17, pp. B141-B164; Carlsson, C., Fuller, R., Fuzzy multiple criteria decision making: recent developments (1996) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 78, pp. 139-153; Conroy, M.J., Mapping biodiversity for conservation and land use decisions (2000) Spatial Information for Land Use Management, pp. 145-158. , Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, The Netherlands, M.J.
