Location Amazonia. Methods The impacts of expected global climate change on the potential and realized distributions of a representative sample of 69 individual Angiosperm species in Amazonia were simulated from 1990 to 2095. The climate trend followed the HADCM2GSa1 scenario, which assumes an annual 1% increase of atmospheric CO2 content with effects mitigated by sulphate forcing. Potential distributions of species in one-degree grid cells were modelled using a suitability index and rectilinear envelope based on bioclimate variables. Realized distributions were additionally limited by spatial contiguity with, and proximity to, known record sites. A size-structured population model was simulated for each cell in the realized distributions to allow for lags in response to climate change, but dispersal was not included. Results In the resulting simulations, 43% of all species became non-viable by 2095 because their potential distributions had changed drastically, but there was little change in the realized distributions of most species, owing to delays in population responses. Widely distributed species with high tolerance to environmental variation exhibited the least response to climate change, and species with narrow ranges and short generation times the greatest. Climate changed most in north-east Amazonia while the best remaining conditions for lowland moist forest species were in western Amazonia. Main conclusions To maintain the greatest resilience of Amazonian biodiversity to climate change as modelled by HADCM2GSa1, highest priority should be given to strengthening and extending protected areas in western Amazonia that encompass lowland and montane forests. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazonia; Biodiversity mapping; Biodiversity scenarios; Biodiversity trends; Climate change modelling; Conservation planning; Spatial interpolation; Tropical forest","biodiversity; climate change; ecological impact; ecological modeling; global change; tropical forest; angiosperm; environmental impact; global climate; montane forest; population distribution; Amazonia; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; Magnoliophyta",,,,,,"An ordinal classification for the families of flowering plants (1998) Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 85, pp. 531-553. , Angiosperm Phylogeny Group; Bawa, K.S., Markham, A., Climate change and tropical forests (1995) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 10, pp. 348-349; Borchert, R., Responses of tropical trees to rainfall seasonality and its long term changes (1998) Climatic Change, 39, pp. 381-393; ter Braak, C.J.F., Prentice, I.C., A theory of gradient analysis (1988) Advances in Ecological Research, 18, pp. 271-319; Brewer, S.W., Rejmánek, M., Small rodents as significant dispersers of tree seeds in a neotropical forest (1999) Journal of Vegetation Science, 10, pp. 165-174; Buckland, S.T., Elston, D.A., Empirical models for the spatial distribution of wildlife (1993) Journal of Applied Ecology, 30, pp. 478-495; Bush, M.B., Distributional change and conservation on the Andean flank: A palaeoecological perspective (2002) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 11, pp. 463-473; Bush, M.B., Rivera, R., Pollen dispersal and representation in a neotropical rain forest (1998) Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters, 7, pp. 379-392; Carpenter, G., Gillison, A.N., Winter, I., DOMAIN: A flexible modelling procedure for mapping potential distributions of plants and animals (1993) Biodiversity and Conservation, 2, pp. 667-680; Clark, D.A., Clark, D.B., Life history diversity of canopy and emergent trees in a neotropical rain forest (1992) Ecological Monographs, 62, pp. 315-344; Condit, R., Hubbell, S.P., Foster, R.B., Mortality rates of 205 neotropical tree species and responses to a severe drought (1995) Ecological Monographs, 65, pp. 419-439; Cox, P.M., Betts, R.A., Jones, C.D., Spall, S.A., Totterdell, I.J., Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 184-187; Cramer, W., Bondeau, A., Woodward, F.I., Prentice, I.C., Betts, R.A., Brovkin, V., Cox, J., Young-Molling, C., Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO 2 and climate change: Results from six dynamic global vegetation models (2001) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 357-373; Crowley, P.H., Resampling methods for computation-intensive data analysis in ecology and evolution (1992) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 23, pp. 405-447; Eastman, J.R., (1997) IDRISI for Windows.
