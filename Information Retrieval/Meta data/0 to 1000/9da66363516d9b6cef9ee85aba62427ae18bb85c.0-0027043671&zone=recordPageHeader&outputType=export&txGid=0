The gap models mimic forest reproduction and growth as a successional process. The modeled period included a mid-postglacial period that was warmer than today's climate. The same gap model was used to simulate potential future vegetation dynamics, driven by projections of a future climate that was controlled by greenhouse gases. Resulting projections of vegetation response to climate change appear to be affected more by the rate than by the magnitude of climate change. -from Authors",,"climatic change; forest ecosystem; greenhouse effect; Holocene; USA, Michigan, Upper Peninsula",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00455067,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027043671
