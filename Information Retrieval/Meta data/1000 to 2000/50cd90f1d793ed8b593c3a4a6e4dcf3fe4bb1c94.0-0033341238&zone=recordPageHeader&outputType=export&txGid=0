Regardless of which side of the issue you are on, there is no debate that increasing energy efficiency is important to environmental preservation. One of the most effective energy efficient technologies available is mineral fiber insulation. The examples presented will give energy management professionals the evidence they need to consider industrial insulation a time-tested, off-the-shelf technology for achieving major reductions in operating costs and CO2 emissions.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer software; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Heat losses; Pipe; Carbon dioxide emissions; Industrial insulation; Mineral fiber insulation; Insulation",,,,,,,"Brayman, W.J.; North American Insulation, Manufacturers Assoc, Alexandria, United States",,,"Fairmont Press Inc, Lilburn, GA, United States",,,,,01998595,,EENGD,,"English","Energy Eng",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033341238
