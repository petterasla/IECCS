We present the first models based on area measurements of magnetic plages from CaK spectroheliograms obtained between 1915-1999. Correlation of our time series of UV irradiance with global temperature, T, accounts for only 20% of the global temperature variance during the 20th century. Correlation of our total irradiance time series with T accounts statistically for 80% of the variance in global temperature over that period, although the irradiance variation amplitude is insufficient to influence global warming in present-day climate models. This interesting difference has been obscured in past modelling by additional components introduced to represent secular variations, which are no longer supported by current observational evidence. Future irradiance models emphasizing the more securely- based contributions of photospheric magnetic structures seem to provide better prospects for improved physical understanding of sun-climate links.",,"Correlation methods; Global warming; Magnetic materials; Solar radiation; Ultraviolet radiation; Climate models; Geophysics; climate forcing; solar radiation; twentieth century; ultraviolet radiation",,,,,,"Baliunas, S., Jastrow, R., Evidence for long-term brightness changes of solar-like stars (1990) Nature, 348, pp. 520-523; Bond, G., Persistent solar influence on North Atlantic climate during the holocene (2001) Science, 294, pp. 2130-2136; Eddy, J., The maunder minimum (1976) Science, 192, pp. 1189-1202; Foukal, P., Behavior of solar magnetic plages measured from Mt Wilson observations between 1915-1984 (1996) Geophys.
