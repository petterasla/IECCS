NASA and the Department of Energy's selection of this site confirmed the wind resource, and the windmill's striking presence above town sparked a great deal of imagination. But a newly elected President Reagan removed solar panels from the White House, and along with them went public investment in renewable energy. Nearly 3 decades later the converging threats of peak oil and global warming are compelling reasons to reconsider the wind in Appalachia. Howard's Knob is a poignant reminder of a comparative advantage that could spawn vital new industries and sustainable livelihoods. Appalachia's coal and timber helped to underwrite America's 20th century growth, but the process left a legacy of poverty and environmental destruction. Most recently, free trade agreements have sparked a wave of unemployment prompting citizens, business, and local government to look for a better way forward.",,"mill; renewable resource; sustainable development; wind power; wind turbine; Appalachians; North America; United States",,,,,,"Barber, J., (2006) Mapping the Movement Toward Sustainable Production and Consumption in North America, , http://www.isforum.org/pubs/, Forum Available at accessed on 20 April 2006; LeRoy, G., (2005) The Great American Jobs Scam: Corporate Tax Dodging and the Myth of Job Creation, , San Francis co, CA: Berrett Koehler; Loveland, G., (2005) Under the Workers Caps: From Champion Mill to Blue Ridge Paper, , Knoxville.
