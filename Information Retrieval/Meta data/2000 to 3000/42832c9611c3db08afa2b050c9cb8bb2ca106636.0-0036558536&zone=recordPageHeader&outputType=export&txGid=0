Analysis of simulations of a climate model including observed increases in greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols reveals a similar trend in the DTR of -0.2°C per century, albeit of smaller magnitude than the observed -0.8°C per century. This trend in the model simulations is related to changes in cloud cover and soil moisture. These results indicate that the observed decrease in the DTR could be a signal of anthropogenic forcing of recent climate change.",,"Aerosols; Climate change; Clouds; Global warming; Moisture; Soils; Anthropogenic forcing; Diurnal temperature range (DTR); Climatology; air temperature; climate modeling; global warming; trend analysis",,,,,,"Boer, G.J., Flato, G.M., Reader, M.C., Ramsden, D., A transient climate change simulation with greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing: Experimental design and comparison with the instrumental record for the twentieth century (2000) Clim.
