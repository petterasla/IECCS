However, it will have little effect on the near steady state CO2 concentration and corresponding global warming achieved on a millennial timescale once emissions are negligible and the added carbon has been distributed between the ocean, atmosphere and land. Using a simple model with mid-range climate sensitivity, we estimate that the maximum rate of global warming can be limited to &lt;0.2°C/decade by limiting the rate of increase in fossil fuel emissions this century to &lt;0.03 GtC/yr/yr. However, regardless of the emissions pathway, if the known fossil fuel resource of ∼4000 GtC is emitted, CO2 will reach ∼1000 ppmv and the Earth will be warmed by &gt;5°C by the end of the millennium. The more carbon emitted, the greater the fraction that remains in the atmosphere, because of positive feedbacks in the carbon cycle-climate system. Less carbon must be emitted to lessen eventual warming. Early consideration should therefore be given to leaving a fraction of fossil carbon unused, and/or to carbon capture and storage.",,"Carbon monoxide; Fossil fuels; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Sensitivity analysis; Global warming rate; Global warming; carbon dioxide; emission control; global warming; mitigation",,,,,,"Archer, D., Kheshgi, H., Maier-Reimer, E., Dynamics of fossil fuel CO2 neutralization by marine CaCO3 (1998) Global Biogeochem.
