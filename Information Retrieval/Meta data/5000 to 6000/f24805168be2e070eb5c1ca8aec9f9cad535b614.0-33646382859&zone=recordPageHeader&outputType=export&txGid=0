With continued global warming, bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, causing up to 60% coral mortality globally within the next few decades4-6. Although some corals are able to recover and to survive bleaching7,8, the mechanisms underlying such resilience are poorly understood. Here we show that the coral host has a significant role in recovery and resilience. Bleached and recovering Montipora capitata (branching) corals met more than 100% of their daily metabolic energy requirements by markedly increasing their feeding rates and CHAR (per cent contribution of heterotrophically acquired carbon to daily animal respiration), whereas Porites compressa (branching) and Porites lobata (mounding) corals did not. These findings suggest that coral species with high-CHAR capability during bleaching and recovery, irrespective of morphology, will be more resilient to bleaching events over the long term, could become the dominant coral species on reefs, and may help to safeguard affected reefs from potential local and global extinction. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecology; Metabolism; Morphology; Plasticity; Seawater; Coral bleaching; Coral species; Heterotrophic plasticity; Porites compressa; Marine biology; sea water; bleaching; coral; coral reef; global warming; heterotrophy; morphology; mortality; species diversity; article; bleaching; colony formation; coral reef; ecosystem; endosymbiosis; feeding behavior; greenhouse effect; heterotrophic plasticity; heterotrophy; marine environment; mechanics; metabolic rate; nonhuman; priority journal; species extinction; survival time; water temperature; Animalia; Anthozoa; Montipora capitata; Porites compressa; Porites lobata",,,,,,"Glynn, P., Coral reef bleaching: Facts, hypotheses and implications (1996) Global Change Biol., 2, pp. 495-509; Jokiel, P.L., Coles, S.L., Response of Hawaiian and other Indo-Pacific reef corals to elevated temperature (1990) Coral Reefs, 8, pp. 155-162; Hughes, T.P., Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of cora reefs (2003) Science, 301, pp. 929-933; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's coral reefs (1999) Mar.
