Decision makers are required to make informed decisions about the environmental implications of wood biofuels today that will affect the medium and long-term development of a wood-based biofuels industry in Norway. We first assess the national forest-derived resource base for use in biofuel production. A set of biomass conversion technologies is then chosen and evaluated for scenarios addressing biofuel production and consumption by select industry sectors. We then apply an environmentally extended, mixed-unit, two-region input-output model to quantify the global warming mitigation and fossil fuel displacement potentials of two biofuel production and consumption scenarios in Norway up to 2050. We find that a growing resource base, when used to produce advanced biofuels, results in cumulative global warming mitigation potentials of between 58 and 83 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents avoided (Mt-CO2-eq.-avoided) in Norway, depending on the biofuel scenario. In recent years, however, the domestic pulp and paper industry-due to increasing exposure to international competition, capacity reductions, and increasing production costs-has been in decline. In the face of a declining domestic pulp and paper industry, imported pulp and paper products are required to maintain the demand for these goods and thus the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the exporting region embodied in Norway's pulp and paper imports reduce the systemwide benefit in terms of avoided greenhouse gas emissions by 27%. © 2010 by Yale University.","Environmental input-output analysis; Forest products; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Industrial ecology; Scenario analysis","Biofuel production; Biomass conversion; Boreal forests; Capacity reduction; Considerable resources; Decision makers; Displacement potentials; Domestic pulp; Emerging technologies; Environmental assessment; Environmental implications; Forest products; Imported pulp; Increasing production; Industrial ecology; Industry sectors; Informed decision; Input output analysis; Input output model; International competitions; Long-term development; Low-carbon; National forests; Pulp and paper imports; Resource base; Scenario analysis; Bioconversion; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Competition; Ecology; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Paper; Pulp; Paper and pulp industry; alternative fuel; biofuel; boreal forest; carbon dioxide; decision making; emission control; environmental assessment; forest product; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; fuelwood; global warming; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; pulp and paper industry; Carbon Dioxide; Competition; Ecology; Emission; Foreign Trade; Forest Products; Fossil Fuels; Gas; Greenhouse Gases; Paper Industry; Pulp Industry; Norway",,,,,,"Baitz, M., Binder, M., Degen, W., Deimling, S., Krinke, S., Rudloff, M., (2004) Comparative life-cycle assessment for SunDiesel (CHOREN process) and conventional diesel fuel: Executive summary, , Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany: PE EUROPE GmbH-Life Cycle Engineering; Bjørnstad, E., Storø, H.M., Lavutslippsregion Midt-Norge?
