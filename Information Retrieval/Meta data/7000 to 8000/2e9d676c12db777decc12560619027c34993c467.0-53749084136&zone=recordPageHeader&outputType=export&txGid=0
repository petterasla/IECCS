Results show that the SST anomalies (SSTA) in the North Atlantic in summer reflected three basic models. The first SVD mode of SST pattern shows a dipole - like variation with the positive center located at southwest and negative center at northeast of extratropical North Atlantic. And it strongly relates to the positive trend in AI variation in northwest China. The second coupled modes display the coherent positive anomalies in extratropical North Atlantic SST and the marked opposite trend of AI variability between north and south of Xinjiang. In addition, the lag correlation analysis of the first mode of SSTA and geopotential heights at 500 hPa variations also shows that the indication of the former influencing the latter configuration, which result in higher air temperature and less precipitation when the SSTA in the North Atlantic Ocean in summer motivated Eurasian circulation of EA pattern, further to influence the wet - dry variations in northwest China by the ocean-to-atmosphere forcing.","Aridity index; SSTA; SVD; Teleconnection patterns","air-sea interaction; aridity; climate variation; correlation; decomposition analysis; drought; global warming; regional climate; sea surface temperature; summer; teleconnection; temperature anomaly; Asia; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); China; Eurasia; Far East; Xinjiang Uygur",,,,,,"Shabbar, A., Skinner, W., Summer drought patterns in Canada and the Relationship to global sea surface temperatures (2003) J Climate, 17, pp. 2866-2880; Battisti, D.S., Bhatt, U.S., Alexander, M.A., A modeling study of the interannual variability in the wintertime North Atlantic Ocean (1995) J Climate, 8, pp. 3067-3083; Cai, J., Yu, L., Lei, T., Estimating reference evapotranspiration with FAO Penman-Monteith equation using daily weather forecast messages (2007) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 145, pp. 22-35; Wen, C., Kang, L., Ding, W., The coupling relationship between summer rainfall in China and global sea surface temperature (2006) Climatic and Environmental Research, 11 (3), pp. 259-269. , in Chinese; Dai, X., Li, W., Ma, Z., The variations of water vapor resources in Xinjiang during recent decade (2006) Progress in Natural Science, 16 (12), pp. 1651-1656; Deser, C., Blackmon, M.L., Surface climate variations over the North Atlantic Ocean during winter: 1900-1989 (1993) J Climate, 6, pp. 1743-1753; Heim Jr., R.R., A review of twentieth-century drought indices used in the United States (2002) Bull Amer Meteor Soc, 83, pp. 1149-1165; Hoerling, J.D., Kumar, A., The perfect ocean for drought (2003) Science, 299, pp. 691-694; Liang, Z., Zhiping, W., Jieyi, L., Relationship between Indian Ocean dipole and ENSO and their connection with the onset of South China Sea summer monsoon (2006) Acta Oceanologica Sinica, 25 (6), pp. 22-32; Ma, Z., Hua, L., Ren, X., The extreme dry/wet events in Northern China during recent 100 years (2003) Acta Geograpuica Sinca, 58 (9), pp. 69-74; Hoerling, M., The perfect ocean for drought (2003) Science, 299, pp. 691-694; Sung, M.-K., Won-Tae Kwon, H.-J., A possible impact of North Atlantic oscillation on the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation (2006) Geophy Res Lett, 33, pp. L21713; Peng, S., Fyfe, J., The coupled patterns between sea level pressure and sea surface Temperature in the Midlatitude North Atlantic (1996) J Climate, 9, pp. 1824-1838; Shi, Y., Shen, Y., Hu, R., Preliminary study on signal, impact and foreground of climatic shift from warm-dry to warm-humid in northwest China (2002) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 24 (3), pp. 219-226. , in Chinese; Wallace, J.M., Gutzler, D.S., Teleconnections in the 500 mb geopotential height field during the Northern Hemisphere winter (1981) Mon Wea Rev, 109, pp. 784-812; Wallace, J.M., Smith, C., Bretherton, C.S., Singular value decomposition of winter-time sea surface temperature and 500-mb height anomalies (1992) J Climate, 5, pp. 561-576; Qi, W., Liu, Q., Yu, R., A possible role of the South China Sea in ENSO cycle (2002) Acta Oceanologica Sinica, 21 (2), pp. 217-226; Wei, X., Chen, J., The response relationship of the rainy season precipitation in northern Xinjiang to EN-SO and period analysis (2003) Acta Oceanologica Sinica, 25 (1), pp. 120-127. , in Chinese; Yang Jianping, Ding Yongjian, Chen Rensheng, et al. 2002.
