We explored how climate and vegetation onset (satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index data) determined individual performance in three reindeer populations (data on 27 814 calves sampled over 11 years). Snow conditions, spring temperatures and topography were the main determinants of the onset of the vegetation. An earlier onset positively affected the body mass of calves born the following autumn, while there was no significant direct negative impact of the previous winter. This study underlines the major impact of winter and spring climatic conditions, determining the spring and summer food availability, and the subsequent growth of calves among alpine herbivores. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Environmental variations; Normalized difference vegetation index; North Atlantic Oscillation; Rangifer tarandus","climate change; global warming; NDVI; North Atlantic Oscillation; phenology; plant-herbivore interaction; animal experiment; article; body mass; controlled study; food availability; landscape; nonhuman; phenology; priority journal; reindeer; seasonal variation; spring; topography; vegetation dynamics; winter; Animals; Body Size; Climate; Feeding Behavior; Female; Male; Periodicity; Plants; Reindeer; Reproduction; Seasons; Snow; Animalia; Rangifer tarandus",,,,,,"Chmielewski, F.M., Rotzer, T., Annual and spatial variability of the beginning of growing season in Europe in relation to air temperature changes (2002) Clin.
