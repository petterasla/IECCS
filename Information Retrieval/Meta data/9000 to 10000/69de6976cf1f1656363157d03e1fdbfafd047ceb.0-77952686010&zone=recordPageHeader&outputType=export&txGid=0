The methodology should be useful as one additional constraint when determining the best molecule to use for an industrial application. The strategy is based on the results of a recent study where we examined molecular properties of global warming molecules using ab initio electronic structure methods to determine which fundamental molecular properties are important in assessing the radiative efficiency of a molecule. Six classes of perfluorinated compounds are investigated. For similar numbers of fluorine atoms, their absorption of radiation in the IR window decreases according to perfluoroethers > perfluorothioethers≈ sulfur?carbon compounds > perfluorocarbons > perfluoroolefins > carbon?nitrogen compounds. Perfluoroethers and hydrofluorethers are shown to possess a large absorption in the IR window due to (i) the C - O bonds are very polar, (ii) the C-O stretches fall within the IR window and have large IR intensity due to their polarity, and (iii) the IR intensity for C-F stretches in which the fluorine atom is bonded to the carbon that is bonded to the oxygen atom is enhanced due to a larger C - F bond polarity. Lengthening the carbon chain leads to a larger overall absorption in the IR window, though the IR intensity per bond is smaller. Finally, for a class of partially fluorinated compounds with a set number of electronegative atoms, the overall absorption in the IR window can vary significantly, as much as a factor of 2, depending on how the fluorine atoms are distributed within the molecule.","Climate change; Fluorocarbons; Infrared absorption; Quantum chemistry calculations; Vibrational frequency","carbon; ether derivative; fluorine derivative; sulfur derivative; article; chemical bond; greenhouse effect; infrared radiation; priority journal; radiation absorption; Absorption; Atmosphere; Carbon; Fluorocarbons; Global Warming; Oxygen; Radiation; Vibration",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Fluorocarbons; Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Hansen, J., Sato, M., Ruedy, R., Lacis, A., Valder, O., Global warming in the twenty-first century: An alternative scenario (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 97, pp. 9875-9880; Shine, K.P., Sturges, W.T., CO2 is not the only gas (2007) Science, 315, pp. 1804-1805; Velders, G.J.M., Fahey, D.W., Daniel, J.S., McFarland, M., Anderson, S.O., The large contribution of projected HFC emissions of future climate forcing (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 106, pp. 10949-10954; Bera, P.P., Horny, L., Schaefer III, H.F., Cyclic perfluorocarbon radicals and anions having high global warming potentials (GWPs): Structures, electron affinities, and vibrational frequencies (2004) Journal of the American Chemical Society, 126 (21), pp. 6692-6702. , DOI 10.1021/ja0305297; Forster, P., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
