Water management is the principal medium through which projected impacts of global warming will be felt and ameliorated. Many standard hydrological practices, based on assumptions of a stationary climate, can be extended to accommodate numerous aspects of climate uncertainty. Classical engineering risk and reliability strategies developed by the water management profession to cope with contemporary climate uncertainties can also be effectively employed during this transition period, while a new family of hydrological tools and better climate change models are developed. An expansion of the concept of ""robust decision making,"" coupled with existing analytical tools and techniques, is the basis for a new approach advocated for planning and designing water resources infrastructure under climate uncertainty. Ultimately, it is not the tools and methods that need to be revamped as much as the suite of decision rules and evaluation principles used for project justification. They need to be aligned to be more compatible with the implications of a highly uncertain future climate trajectory, so that the hydrologic effects of that uncertainty are correctly reflected in the design of water infrastructure. © 2011 American Water Resources Association.","Adaptive management; Climate uncertainty; Climate variability; Economic decision rules; Integrated water resources management; Robust decision making","Adaptive Management; Climate uncertainty; Climate variability; Economic decision rules; Integrated water resources management; Robust decisions; Climate models; Climatology; Global warming; Models; Professional aspects; Water management; Water supply; Decision making; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; decision making; hydrological response; infrastructural development; integrated approach; occupation; planning practice; uncertainty analysis; water management; water resource",,,,,,"Anagnostopoulos, G.G., Koutsoyiannis, D., Christofides, A., Efstratiadis, A., Mamassis, N., A Comparison of Local and Aggregated Climate Model Outputs With Observed Data (2010) Hydrological Sciences Journal, 55 (7), pp. 1094-1110; Angel, J., Kunkel, K., The Response of Great Lakes Water Levels to Future Climate Scenarios With an Emphasis on Lake Michigan-Huron (2010) Journal of Great Lakes Research, 36 (SUPPL. 2), pp. 51-58; Asbeck, E., Haimes, Y.Y., The Partitioned Multiobjective Risk Method (1984) Large Scale Systems, 6 (1), pp. 13-38; Brekke, L.D., Kiang, J.E., Olsen, J.R., Pulwarty, R.S., Raff, D.A., Turnipseed, D.B., Webb, R.S., White, K.D., (2009), p. 65. , Climate Change and Water Resources Management - A Federal Perspective.
