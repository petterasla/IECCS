There was no discernable effect of spectral resolution on the measured IR spectra. Over the region for which comparison can be made (700-1400 cm-1) the absorption cross-sections were indistinguishable within the experimental uncertainties (±5%) from those reported by Sturges et al. (Science 289 (2000) 611). The absorption feature at 612.5 cm-1 which was not reported by Sturges et al. (2000) was quantified in the present work. Inclusion of this feature increases the global-mean forcing due to SF5CF3 by about 3.5% to 0.59 W m-2ppbv-1 and reinforces the position of SF5CF3 as the most powerful greenhouse gas, per molecule, yet detected in the atmosphere. The 100-yr mass-normalized global warming potential of SF5CF3, relative to CO2 is 19,000. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
