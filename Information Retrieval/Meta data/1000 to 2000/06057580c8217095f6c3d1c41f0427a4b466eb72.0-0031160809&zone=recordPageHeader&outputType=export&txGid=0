The predicted hydrological response in northern California to a climate with doubled CO2 and higher temperatures is a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow, and substantially incrased runoff during winter and less in late spring and summer. One consequence of the predicted earlier runoff is higher salinity in summer and autumn in San Francisco Bay. In saline lakes, the incidence of meromixis and he associated reduction in nutrient supply and algal abundance is expected to vary significantly as runoff fluctuates. In subalpine lakes, global warming will probably lead to increased productivity. Lacustrine productivity can also be altered by changes in wind regimes, drought-enhanced forest fires and maximal or minimal snowpacks associated with atmospheric anomalies such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Reduced stream temperature from increased contributions of glacial meltwater and decreased channel stabiliyt from changed runoff patterns and altered sediment loads has the potential to reduce the diversity of zoobenthic communities in predominantly glacier-fed rivers. Climatic warming is likely to result in reduced growth and survival of sockeye salmon in freshwater, which would, in turn, increase marine mortality.",,"Inland waters; Environmental impact; Glaciers; Global warming; Hydrology; Lakes; Rivers; Runoff; Snow; Thermal effects; Wind effects; Surface waters; carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; climatic change; freshwater ecosystem; hydrological response; hydrology; limnology; precipitation; runoff; saline lake; North America, Pacific Coast; North America, Western Great Basin",,,,,,,"Melack, J.M.; Dept of Ecology, Univ of California, Santa Barbara CA 93106, United States",,,,,,,,08856087,,HYPRE,,"English","Hydrol Processes",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031160809
