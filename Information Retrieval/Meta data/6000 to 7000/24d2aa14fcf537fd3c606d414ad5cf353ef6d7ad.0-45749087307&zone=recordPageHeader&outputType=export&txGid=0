Objectives: The aim of this study was to synthesize and expand upon existing data on the contribution of farm animal production to climate change. Methods: We analyzed the scientific literature on farm animal production and documented green-house gas (GHG) emissions, as well as various mitigation strategies. Discussions: An analysis of meat, egg, and milk production encompasses not only the direct rearing and slaughtering of animals, but also grain and fertilizer production for animal feed, waste storage and disposal, water use, and energy expenditures on farms and in transporting feed and finished animal products, among other key impacts of the production process as a whole. Conclusions: Immediate and far-reaching changes in current animal agriculture practices and consumption patterns are both critical and timely if GHGs from the farm animal sector are to be mitigated.","Animal agriculture; CAFO; Climate change concentrated animal feeding operation; Diet; Environment; Farm animal welfare; Farm animals; Food choices; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs)","carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; agricultural procedures; animal food; animal husbandry; article; breeding; climate change; egg production; energy expenditure; environmental impact; fertilizer application; food industry; greenhouse effect; hunger; meat; milk production; nonhuman; priority journal; slaughterhouse; waste disposal; Agriculture; Animal Feed; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Carbon Dioxide; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Nitrogen; Animalia",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Fertilizers; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Baldauf, S., Africans are already facing climate change (2006) Christian Science Monitor, p. 4. , http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1106/p04s01-woaf.html, 6 November:, Available:, accessed 24 March 2008; Ban, K., A climate culprit in Darfur (2007) Washington Post, pp. A15. , Washington, DC 16 June; Bierbaum, R.M., Holdren, J.P., MacCracken, M.C., Moss, R.H., Raven, P.H., ads, (2007) Confronting Climate Change: Avoiding the Unmanageable, Managing the Unavoidable, , http://www.unfoundation.org/files/pdf/2007/SEG_Report_pdf, Washington, DC:United Nations Foundation.
