Around a century of rainfall data from 33 rain-gauges populate the database used herein. Statistical tests, such as cumulative deviations, Mann-Whitney-Pettitt statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis test, were first employed to determine whether annual rainfall series exhibit any regular trend. Analytical results indicate that the annual rainfall has increased in northern Taiwan, declined in central and southern Taiwan, and exhibited no clear tendency in Eastern Taiwan. Almost all of these rainfall series changed significantly around 1960, which date divides historical rainfall series into two sample groups. This change in the seasonal rainfall was further investigated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Climate change; Cumulative deviations; Kruskal-Wallis statistics; Mann-Whitney-Pettitt test; Precipitation trend analysis","Climate change; Climatology; Rain gages; Statistical tests; Statistics; Cumulative deviations; Kruskal-Wallis statistics; Mann-Whitney-Pettitt test; Precipitation trend analysis; Precipitation (meteorology); Climate change; Climatology; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain gages; Statistical tests; Statistics; annual variation; climate change; precipitation assessment; rainfall; raingauge; seasonal variation; statistical analysis; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Taiwan",,,,,,"Bobba, A.G., Diiwu, J.Y., 'Stochastic analysis of observed hydrological and meteorological data to identify and model trends due to climate change' (2002) Hydrological Science and Technology, 18 (1-4), pp. 43-54; Buishand, T.A., 'Some methods for testing the homogeneity of rainfall records' (1982) Journal of Hydrology, 58, pp. 11-27; Collischonn, W., Tucci, C.E.M., Clarke, R.T., 'Further evidence of changes in the hydrological regime of the River Paraguay part of a wider phenomenon of climate change?'
