We have previously observed that juvenile survival in Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon is strongly correlated with summer temperature in some populations and with fall streamflow in others. Here, we explore potential differential responses of the viability of four of these populations to changes in streamflow and temperature that might result from climate change. First, we linked predicted changes in air temperature and precipitation from several General Circulation Models to a local hydrological model to project streamflow and air temperature under two climate-change scenarios. Then, we developed a stochastic, density-dependent life-cycle model with independent environmental effects in juvenile and ocean stages, and parameterized the model for each population. We found that mean abundance decreased 20-50% and the probability of quasi-extinction increased dramatically (from 0.1-0.4 to 0.3-0.9) for all populations in both scenarios. Differences between populations were greater in the more moderate climate scenario than in the more extreme, hot/dry scenario. Model results were relatively robust to realistic uncertainty in freshwater survival parameters in all scenarios. Our results demonstrate that detailed population models can usefully incorporate climatechange predictions, and that global warming poses a direct threat to freshwater stages in these fish, increasing their risk of extinction. Because differences in habitat may contribute to the individualistic population responses we observed, we infer thatmaintaining habitat diversity will help buffer some species from the impacts of climate change. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Conservation; Endangered species; Habitat diversity; Life-history model; Population dynamics; Population viability model; Stream flow","air temperature; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; density dependence; endangered species; environmental effect; environmental factor; extinction risk; habitat conservation; life cycle analysis; minimum viable population; numerical model; population dynamics; precipitation (climatology); prediction; salmonid; stochasticity; streamflow; uncertainty analysis; North America; Snake River; United States; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",,,,,,"Battin, J., Wiley, M.W., Ruckelshaus, M.H., Palmer, R.N., Korb, E., Bartz, K.K., Imaki, H., Projected impacts of climate change on salmon habitat restoration (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104, pp. 6720-6725; Beamesderfer, R.C.P., Schaller, H.A., Zimmerman, M.P., (1997) Spawner-Recruit Data for Spring and Summer Chinook Salmon Populations in Idaho, Oregon and Washington, , Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Portland, Oregon; Beamish, R.J., Bouillon, D.R., Pacific salmon production trends in relation to climate (1993) Canadian Journal Fish.
