Additionally, the influences of temperature on ecosystems are widely documented, but landscape temperature patterns and relationships with vegetation are rarely reported in ecological studies. To better understand the importance of temperature patterns to the conservation and restoration of native ecosystems, we designed an experiment to investigate relationships among soil surface temperature, landscape heterogeneity, and grazing intensity. Grazing intensity did influence the vegetation structure and composition. Heavy treatments had the greatest bare ground and the least vertical structure. Ungrazed treatments had the most litter and live grass cover. However, average temperatures among the three grazing treatments were not different and ranged less than 2°C during midday summer periods. The temperature difference between riparian and upland landscapes within grazing treatments was 21°C. Landscape position (riparian vs. upland) did have a significant influence on soil surface temperature and produced a variation in temperature 11 times greater than grazing intensities. Thermal heterogeneity did not differ among grazing treatments. Lower soil surface temperatures (associated with riparian areas) may provide a critical thermal refuge for many animals in arid and semiarid ecosystems on hot summer days, when air temperatures can exceed 37°C. Riparian zones, specifically riparian vegetation, are an important component in ecosystem management. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Global climate change; Landscape variability; Riparian; Soil temperature; Thermal refugia","Global climate change; Landscape variability; Riparian; Soil temperature; Thermal refugia; Animals; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Ecology; Landforms; Soil conservation; Soils; Surface properties; Temperature; Vegetation; Ecosystems; climate change; conservation; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; environmental disturbance; grazing pressure; heterogeneity; landscape change; restoration ecology; riparian vegetation; soil temperature; temperature effect; vegetation structure; air temperature; article; controlled study; ecosystem restoration; environmental protection; environmental temperature; grazing; landscape; riparian ecosystem; soil temperature; temperature sensitivity; vegetation; Animals; Cattle; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Models, Biological; Oklahoma; Poaceae; Soil; Temperature; Animalia",,"Soil",,,,"Adler, P.B., Lauenroth, W.K., Livestock exclusion increases the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in Colorado shortgrass steppe (2000) Applied Vegetation Science, 3, pp. 213-222; Balling, R.C., The climatic impact of a Sonoran vegetation discontinuity (1988) Climate Change, 13, pp. 99-109; Balling, R.C., Klopatek, J.M., Hildebrandt, M.L., Moritz, C.K., Watts, C.J., Impacts of land degradation on historical temperature records from the Sonoran Desert (1989) Climate Change, 40, pp. 669-681; Belsky, A.J., Influences of trees on savanna productivity: Tests of shade, nutrients, and tree-grass competition (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 922-932; Berry, J., Bjorkman, O., Photosyntetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants (1980) Annual Review of Plant Physiology, 31, pp. 491-543; Billings, W.D., Mooney, H.A., The ecology of arctic and alpine plants (1968) Biological Reviews, 43, pp. 481-529; Biondini, M.E., Patton, B.D., Nyren, P.E., Grazing intensity and ecosystem processes in a northern mixed-grass prairie, USA (1998) Ecological Applications, 8, pp. 469-479; Bliss, L.C., A comparison of plant development in microenvironments of arctic and alpine tundras (1956) Ecological Monographs, 26, pp. 303-337; Bock, C.E., Bock, J.H., Kenney, W.R., Hawthorne, V.M., Responses of birds, rodents, and vegetation to livestock exclosure in a semidesert grassland site (1984) Journal of Range Management, 37, pp. 239-242; Bryant, N.A., Johnson, L.F., Brazel, A.J., Balling, R.C., Hutchinson, C.F., Beck, L.R., Measuring the effect of overgrazing in the Sonoran Desert (1990) Climatic Change, 17, pp. 243-264; Calder, W.A., King, J.R., Farner, D.S., King, J.R., Parkes, K.C., Thermal and caloric relations of birds (1974) Avian Biology, 4, pp. 259-415. , Academic Press New York; Chen, J., Franklin, J.F., Lowe, J.S., Comparison of abiotic and structurally defined patch patterns in a hypothetical forest landscape (1996) Conservation Biology, 10, pp. 854-862; Christensen, N.L., Pickett, S.T.A., Ostfeld, R.S., Shachak, M., Likens, G.E., Managing for heterogeneity and complexity on dynamic landscapes (1997) The Ecological Basis for Conservation: Heterogeneity, Ecosystems, and Biodiversity, pp. 167-186. , Chapman and Hall New York; Cingolani, A.M., Ney-Meir, I., Diaz, S., Grazing effects on rangeland diversity: A synthesis of contemporary models (2005) Ecological Applications, 15, pp. 757-773; Clark, I., Part I: The semivariogram (1980) Geostatistics, pp. 17-40. , McGraw-Hill, New York; Clum, H.H., The effect of transpiration and environmental factors on leaf temperatures.
