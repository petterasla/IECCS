Since the background SST is high in the tropical western Pacific, even weak SST anomalies may affect strongly the atmospheric circulation including the Aleutian Low and the Asian winter monsoon. The extratropical atmospheric response to the interdecadal SST anomaly is global and looks quite different from that for the ENSO time scale. The response is even reversed in the Asian monsoon region. An interesting positive feedback mechanism responsible for natural climate variabilities ranging from several years to decades may exist in the coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system in the western tropical Pacific. -from Authors",,"atmospheric response; climate; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; interdecadal variability; sea surface temperature; Pacific, (Tropical Western)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027043349
