Due to the diverse soil, land-use types and climatic conditions, there are uncertainties in quantification of greenhouse gas emission from agricultural soils in India. An inventory of the emission of methane and nitrous oxide from different states in India was prepared using the methodology given by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change. For methane emission, state-specific emission coefficients have been used for all major rice ecosystems. In case of nitrous oxide, both direct and indirect emissions from agricultural soils in different states have been calculated using the emission coefficients derived from the experiments conducted in India. For the base year 1994-95, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from Indian agricultural fields were estimated to be 2.9 Tg (61 Tg CO2 equivalent) and 0.08 Tg (39 Tg CO2 equivalent) respectively.",,,,,,,,"(1996) Climate Change (1995): Scientific Technical Report Analyses, p. 880. , Contribution of Working Group II to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (eds Watson, R.
