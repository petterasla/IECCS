Moreover, rates of genetic adaptation and/or changes in the coral-zooxanthella partnerships are considered unlikely to be sufficiently fast for corals to acquire increased physiological resistance to increasing sea temperatures and declining pH. However, it has been suggested that coral reef resilience to climate change may be improved by good local management of coral reefs, including management of water quality. Here, using major data sets from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, we investigate geographic patterns of coral bleaching in 1998 and 2002 and outline a synergism between heat stress and nutrient flux as a major causative mechanism for those patterns. The study provides the first concrete evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of coral reefs to global climate change. ©2009 By tne ecological society of America.","Australia; Bleaching threshold; CO2 limitation; Coral reef; Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN); Great Barrier Reef; Zooanthellae species","nitrogen; water; adaptation; climate change; coral bleaching; coral reef; data set; global climate; remediation; species occurrence; survivorship; synergism; water quality; alga; animal; Anthozoa; article; Australia; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; heat; microbiology; symbiosis; Algae; Animals; Anthozoa; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Hot Temperature; Nitrogen; Queensland; Symbiosis; Water; Australasia; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; Anthozoa",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; water, 7732-18-5; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Al-Horani, F.A., Al-Moghrabi, S.M., De Beer, D., The mechanism of calcification and its relation to photosynthesis and respiration in the scleractinian coral Galaxea fascicularis (2003) Marine Biology, 142 (3), pp. 419-426; Alongi, D.M., McKinnon, A.D., The cycling and fate of terrestrially-derived sediments and nutrients in the coastal zone of the Great Barrier Reef shelf (2005) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 51, pp. 239-252; Andrews, J.C., Gentien, P., Upwelling as a source of nutrients for the Great Barrier Reef ecosystems: A solution to Darwin's question?
