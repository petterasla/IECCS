In the Rodnei Mountains National Park, at the Weather Station Iezer, some manifestations of global warming are visible in the evolution of air temperature and of the quantity of precipitation, particularly in the warm season of the year. As significant is the effect of the variation in the major climate indicators connected directly with the thermal and/or precipitation regime. Some of the main indicators analyzed in this paper suggest that multi-annual mean temperatures and shower days are increasing, while the annual precipitation mean and snow pack thickness are decreasing, foggy days and liquid precipitation become more numerous, solid precipitation days being ever fewer. All these aspects are relevant of the extent to which the study-area is being affected by global climate change.","Climate change; Mountains Rodnei national park","air temperature; climate change; climate effect; evolution; global warming; national park; precipitation (climatology); snowpack; Maramures; Rodna Mountains National Park; Romania",,,,,,"Barry, R.G., Climate change in mountains (1992) The State of the World's Mountains, pp. 359-380. , P.B.
