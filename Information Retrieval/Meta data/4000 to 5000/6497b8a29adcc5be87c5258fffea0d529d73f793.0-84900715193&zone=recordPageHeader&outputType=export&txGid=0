Annual cycling and budget of carbon in a forested basin was investigated to quantify the carbon sequestration of a cool-temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in the Horonai stream basin, Tomakomai Experimental Forest, northern Japan. Net ecosystem exchange, soil respiration, biomass increment, litterfall, soil-solution chemistry, and stream export were observed in the basin from 1999-2001 as a part of IGBP-TEMA project. We found that 258 g C m-2 year-1 was sequestered annually as net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the forested basin. Discharge of carbon to the stream was 4 g C m-2 year-1 (about 2% of NEE) and consisted mainly of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). About 43% of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was retained in the vegetation, while about 57% of NEP was sequestered in soil, suggesting that the movement of sequestered carbon from aboveground to belowground vegetation was an important process for net carbon accumulation in soil. The derived organic carbon from aboveground vegetation that moved to the soil mainly accumulated in the solid phase of the soil, with the result that the export of dissolved organic carbon to the stream was smaller than that of dissolved inorganic carbon. Our results indicated that the aboveground and belowground interaction of carbon fluxes was an important process for determining the rate and retention time of the carbon sequestration in a cool-temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in the southwestern part of Hokkaido, northern Japan. © The Ecological Society of Japan.","Carbon biogeochemistry; Climate change; Eddy flux; Forest ecosystem; Net ecosystem productivity",,,,,,,"Baldocchi, D., Falge, E., Gu, L., Olson, R., Hollinger, D., Running, S., Anthoni, P., Wofsy, S., FLUXNET: A new tool to study the temporal and spatial variability of ecosystem-scale carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy flux densities (2001) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 82, pp. 2415-2434; Chapin III, F.S., Matson, P.A., Mooney, H.A., (2002) Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology, , Springer, New York; Cole, D.W., Rapp, M., Elemental cycling in forest ecosystem (1981) Dynamic Properties of Forest Ecosystems, pp. 341-410. , Reichle ED ed, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Eguchi, S., Sakata, T., Hatano, R., Sakuma, T., Daily change of CO2 efflux from the soil of a deciduous broad-leaved forest and its significance as a CO2 source for vegetation (in Japanese with English summary) (1997) Jpn J Soil Sci Plant Nutr, 68, pp. 138-147; Hiura, T., Stochasticity of species assemblage of canopy trees and understory plants in a temperate secondary forest created by major disturbances (2001) Ecol Res, 16, pp. 887-893; Hiura, T., Above-ground biomass and net biomass increment in a cool temperate forest on a landscape scale (this issue) (2005) Ecol Res, 20; Lloyd, J., The CO2 dependence of photosynthesis, plant growth responses to elevated CO2 concentrations and their interaction with soil nutrient status.
