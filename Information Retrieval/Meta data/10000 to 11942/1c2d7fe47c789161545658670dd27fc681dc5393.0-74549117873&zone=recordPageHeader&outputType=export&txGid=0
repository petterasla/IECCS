This will precipitate ecological shifts as the ranges of species change in response to new climates. During this shift, rapid-colonizing species should increase, whereas slow-colonizing species will at first decrease, but eventually become reestablished in their new range. This successional process has been estimated to require from 100 to over 300 years in small areas, under a stable climate, with a nearby seed source. How much longer will it require on a continental scale, under a changing climate, without a nearby seed source? I considered this question through an examination of the response of fossil plant assemblages from the Grand Canyon, Arizona, to the most recent rapid warming of similar magnitude that occurred at the start of the Holocene, 11,700 years ago. At that time, temperatures in southwestern North America increased about 4 °C over less than a century. Grand Canyon plant species responded at different rates to this warming climate. Early-successional species rapidly increased, whereas late-successional species decreased. This shift persisted throughout the next 2700 years. I found two earlier, less-extreme species shifts following rapid warming events around 14,700 and 16,800 years ago. Late-successional species predominated only after 4000 years or more of relatively stable temperature. These results suggest the potential magnitude, duration, and nature of future ecological changes and have implications for conservation plans, especially those incorporating equilibrium assumptions or reconstituting past conditions. When these concepts are extended to include the most rapid early-successional colonizers, they imply that the recent increases in invasive exotics may be only the most noticeable part of a new resurgence of early-successional vegetation. Additionally, my results challenge the reliability of models of future vegetation and carbon balance that project conditions on the basis of assumptions of equilibrium within only a century. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Colonizing species; Early Holocene; Global warming; Grand Canyon; Plant succession; Vegetation change","carbon balance; conservation planning; fossil record; future prospect; global warming; Holocene; paleobotany; paleoclimate; succession; temperature effect; temporal analysis; vegetation dynamics; article; biodiversity; climate change; fossil; growth, development and aging; plant; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Fossils; Plants; Arizona; Grand Canyon; United States",,,,,,"Anderson, R.C., Feiler, E., Holocene vegetation and climate change on the Colorado Great Plains, USA, and the invasion of Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) (2009) Journal of Biogeography, 36, pp. 2279-2289; Barron, J.A., Huesser, L., Herbert, T., Lyle, M., High-resolution climatic evolution of coastal northern California during the past 16,000 years (2004) Paleoeceanography, 18, pp. 1020-1035; Bergman, J., Hammarlund, D., Hannon, G., Barnekow, L., Wohlfart, B., Deglacial vegetation succession and Holocene tree-limit dynamics in the Scandes Mountains, west-central Sweden: Stratigraphic data compared to megafossil evidence (2005) Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology, 134, pp. 129-151; Betancourt, J.L., Schuster, W.S., Mitton, J.B., Anderson, R.S., Fossil and genetic history of a pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) isolate (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 1685-1697; Bowers, J.E., Webb, R.H., Pierson, E.A., Succession of desert plants on debris flow terraces, Grand Canyon, Arizona (1997) Journal of Arid Environments, 36, pp. 67-86; Burney, D.A., Flannery, T.F., Fifty millennia of catastrophic extinctions after human contact (2005) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 20, pp. 395-401; Christensen, N.L., Peet, R.K., Convergence during secondary forest succession (1984) Journal of Ecology, 72, pp. 25-36; Cole, K.L., Past rates of change, species richness, and a model of vegetational inertia in the Grand Canyon, Arizona (1985) The American Naturalist, 125, pp. 289-303; Cole, K.L., Reconstruction of past desert vegetation along the Colorado River using packrat middens (1990) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, and Palaeoecology, 76, pp. 349-366; Cole, K.L., Arundel, S., Carbon isotopes from fossil packrat pellets and elevational movements of Utah agave reveal Younger Dryas cold period in Grand Canyon, Arizona (2005) Geology, 33, pp. 713-716; Cole, K.L., Ironside, K., Arundel, S., Duffy, P., Shaw, J., Modeling future plant distributions on the Colorado Plateau: An example using Pinus edulis (2008) The Colorado Plateau III; Integrating Research and Resources Management for Effective Conservation., pp. 319-330. , Pages. in.
