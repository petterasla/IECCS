In this study, a dynamic model was built in which LCA and PBM were integrated to quantitatively assess the total environmental impacts induced by the product population in a society over time. Specifically, a determination was carried out concerning how Japan's air conditioner population is used (lifetime distribution, number of units, etc.) and an assessment was made concerning the Global Warming Potential (GWP) associated with the air conditioner population. Methods. The proposed dynamic model was applied to air conditioners for analyzing the total GWP caused by the air conditioner population in Japan from 1990 to 2010. To create a trend forecast model for future environmental load, scenarios for air conditioner production up to 2010 were formulated and the total GWP from the air conditioner population was predicted. Conducted also were sensitivity analyses whose parameters were air conditioner performance, lifetime and the rate of refrigerant recovery when retired units are processed. Results and Discussion. Applying the PBM to the air conditioner population in 2000, it was found that 81.5 million units consumed 5.94 x 1010 kWh in that year, which was a 6.1% increase in the total annual power consumption in 1990. In both a stationary scenario and a steady growth (1.5% annual increase), it was found that the total GWP would be 27.7% higher than in 1990 under the stationary scenario and 37.8% higher under the steady growth scenario. The improvements in air conditioner performance will have a small effect on reducing the total GWP from that population. Furthermore, in connection with the average lifetime, it was found that the GWP, due to refrigerant releases when units are disposed of, would be relatively large in 2000 and the following years. Conclusions. Thus, shorter product lifetimes will spur a replacement of air conditioners with new units, a situation that will only lead to the reduction of GWP if the recovery rate of refrigerant is to be achieved to more than 50% under the stationary scenario. Recommendations and Outlook. To meet COP3 targets for Japan in 2010 (i.e. to reach the same level as in 1990 for household appliances), our study shows that it will be vital to raise the refrigerant recovery rate. If the number of air conditioners in use remains unchanged, recovery would have to be 45.7%, but under the steady growth scenario it would have to be at least 60.4%. Therefore, it will be difficult to meet COP3 targets unless the refrigerant recovery rate is strongly increased. This method is applicable to assess not only the GWP of air conditioners, but also other environmental impacts caused by a variety of product populations, which will be quite effective for setting targets of products' performance, policymaking, etc.","Air conditioner; COP3 target; Global warming potential (GWP); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Lifetime shift; Performance improvement; Population balance model (PBM); Scenario analysis; Sensitivity analysis","industrial chemical; refrigerant; unclassified drug; air conditioning; analytic method; article; energy consumption; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; growth; Japan; life cycle; life cycle assessment; lifespan; parameter; performance; policy; priority journal; quantitative analysis",,,,,,"(2000) Total Energy Statistics, , Tsusho Sangyo Kenkyusha, Tokyo; (2001) Energy Conservation Performance Catalog 2001; (2001) Environmental Report 2000; Yanagitani, K., Kawahara, K., LCA study of air conditioners with an alternative refrigerant (1998) Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Ecobalance, pp. 231-234. , Tsukuba, Japan; Okamoto, Y., Tanaka, J., Taira, S., Yanagitani, K., Development of environmental friendly room air conditioners (2000) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Ecobalance, pp. 67-70. , Tsukuba, Japan; (1997) Environmental Management - Life Cycle Assessment Principle and Framework, , Reference number ISO 14040; Field, F., Kirchain, R., Clark, J., Life-cycle assessment and temporal distributions of emissions: Developing a fleet-based analysis (2000) J Ind Ecol, 4, pp. 71-91; Randolph, A.D., A population balance for countable entities (1964) Can J Chem Eng, 42, pp. 280-281; Hara, T., Yanagisawa, Y., Yamazaki, A., An analysis of energy-saving potential of household refrigerators based on a number balance model (2001) J Jpn Inst Energy, 80 (11), pp. 1033-1041; Kakudate, K., Suzuki, T., Adachi, Y., A macro model for usage and recycling pattern of steel in Japan using the PBM (2000) Sci Technol Adv Materials, 1, pp. 105-116; (2002) Ministry of Environment, Environmental Report, , Printing Bureau, Ministry of Finance, Japan; Matsuno, Y., Betz, M., Development of life cycle inventories for electricity grid mixes in Japan (2000) Int J LCA, 5 (5), pp. 295-305; Japanese Industrial Standards: JIS C9612Ueno, K., (2001) J Japan Inst Energy, 80 (12), pp. 1100-1107; Houghton, J.T., Meira L.G.
