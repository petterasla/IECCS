The tropospheric lapse rate γ is about 6.1 K/km in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) as a whole and over the ocean and about 6.2 K/km over the continents. The value of γ decreases from 6.5 K/km at low latitudes to 4.5 K/km at polar latitudes. The values of dγ/dTs, the parameter of sensitivity of γ to the variation of Ts for the NH in the interannual variability, are found to be about 0.04 km-1 (0.041 km-1 for the NH as a whole, 0.042 km-1 over the ocean, and 0.038 km-1 over the continents). This corresponds to an increase in γ of approximately 0.7% when the surface temperature of the NH is increased by 1 K. Estimates of dγ/ dTs vary from about 0.05 km-1 in the subtropics to 0.10 km-1 at polar latitudes. When dγ/dTs is positive, the surface and tropospheric warming means a temperature decrease above a certain critical level Hcr. The height of the level Hcr with constant temperature, which is defined by the inverse value (dγ/dTs)-1, is about 25 km for the NH as a whole, i.e., above the tropopause. In the subtropics, Hcr is about 20 km. At polar latitudes, Hcr decreases to about 10 km. Positive values of dγ/dTs characterize a positive climatic feedback through the lapse rate and indicate a general decrease in the static stability of the troposphere during global warming. Along with a general tendency of γ to increase with rising Ts, there are regional regimes with the opposite tendency, mainly over the ocean. The negative correlation of γ with Ts is found over the oceanic tropics and midlatitudes, in particular, over the oceanic belt around Antarctica. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2006.",,"global warming; surface temperature; troposphere",,,,,,"(1987) Anthropogenic Climate Changes, , Ed. by M.
