In a 2006 Science article, a group of ecologists and economists warned that the world may run out of seafood from natural stocks if overfishing continues at current rates. In this paper, we explore the interaction between a constant proportion harvest policy and recruitment dynamics. We examine the discrete-time constant proportion harvest policy discussed in Ang et al. (2009) and then expand the framework to include stock-recruitment functions that are compensatory and overcompensatory, both with and without the Allee effect. We focus on constant proportion policies (CPPs). CPPs have the potential to stabilize complex overcompensatory stock dynamics, with or without the Allee effect, provided the rates of harvest stay below a threshold. If that threshold is exceeded, CPPs are known to result in the sudden collapse of a fish stock when stock recruitment exhibits the Allee effect. In case studies, we analyze CPPs as they might be applied to Gulf of Alaska Pacific halibut fishery and the Georges Bank Atlantic cod fishery based on harvest rates from 1975 to 2007. The best fit models suggest that, under high fishing mortalities, the halibut fishery is vulnerable to sudden population collapse while the cod fishery is vulnerable to steady decline to zero. The models also suggest that CPP with mean harvesting levels from the last 30. years can be effective at preventing collapse in the halibut fishery, but these same policies would lead to steady decline to zero in the Atlantic cod fishery. We observe that the likelihood of collapse in both fisheries increases with increased stochasticity (for example, weather variability) as predicted by models of global climate change. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Allee effect; Compensatory and overcompensatory dynamics; Sustainability","Allee effect; Best-fit models; Compensatory and overcompensatory dynamics; Current rate; Discrete-time; Environmental factors; Fish stock; Georges Bank; Global climate changes; Gulf of Alaska; Harvest rates; Pacific halibut; Stochasticity; Sustainability; Weather variability; Climate change; Climate models; Employment; Harvesting; Population statistics; Fisheries; Allee effect; fishery policy; harvesting; mortality; overfishing; recruitment (population dynamics); stock assessment; sustainability; agricultural parameters; Allee effect; article; climate change; compensatory stock dynamics; constant proportion harvest policy; fish stock; fishery management; global climate; harvest; mathematical model; overcompensatory stock dynamics; population biology; population dynamics; sustainable agriculture; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fisheries; Flounder; Gadus morhua; Models, Biological; Pacific Ocean; Population Dynamics; Gulf of Alaska; Pacific Ocean; Gadus morhua; Hippoglossus stenolepis",,,,,,"Ang, M., Conrad, J.M., Just, D., (2009), Proportional harvest policies: An application to Pacific halibut Working Paper, Department of Applied Economics and Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, NYBenaìm, M., Shreiber, S.J., Persistence of structured populations in random environments (2009) Theor.
