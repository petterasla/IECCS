China has launched the environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting small satellite constellation HJ-1A/B and the FY3 atmosphere and environmental satellite, but they still cannot fully satisfy requirements for environmental monitoring. This paper summarizes the current status of satellite environmental monitoring in China and the existing problems of inadequate load design and low data utilization efficiency, and discusses the demand for environmental monitoring satellites. Based on the development of foreign satellite systems for environmental monitoring, the future development and key tasks of the environmental monitoring satellite system in China is discussed, as are some related initiatives. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","environmental monitoring; environmental satellite; global climate change; satellite system; specialty load","Environmental Monitoring; Environmental satellites; global climate change; satellite system; specialty load; Climate change; Communication satellites; Electric load forecasting; Environmental engineering; Remote sensing; Weather forecasting; Monitoring; climate change; disaster management; environmental monitoring; forecasting method; global climate; remote sensing; satellite imagery; China",,,,,,"Wang, Q., Yang, Y.P., Huang, J.Z., (2005) Environmental Remote Sensing, , Beijing: Science Press; Ma, J.W., Tian, G.L., Wang, C.Y., Review of the development of remote sensing change detection technology (2004) Adva Earth Sci, 19, pp. 192-196; Fang, Z.Y., Liu, Y.J., Zhu, X.X., (2003) Earth Observation Satellites in the Global Change Applications, , Beijing: China Meteorological Press; Yang, J., Dong, C.H., Lu, N.M., FY-3A: New generation polarorbiting meteorological satellite of China (2009) Acta Meteorol Sin, 67, pp. 501-509; (2000) Review of Earth Science Enterprise Application Strategy for 2000-2010, , NASA, Washington D C: National Academy Press; Xu, Q., The development of GMES (2008) Aerospace China, 1, pp. 26-30; Zhang, H., Zhang, B., The strategic enterprise of global change research-A brief introduction to earth science enterprise (2002) Remote Sens Technolo Appl, 17, pp. 376-380; (2010) The EOS Global Change Media Directory, , http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp-doc/; Wang, Y., The development of the earth observation system (2005) Adv Earth Sci, 20, pp. 25-37; Li, F., Goldstein, R.M., Studies of multi-baseline spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radars (1989) IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sensing, 28, pp. 88-97; Parkinson, C.L., (2000) EOS Data Products Handbook, , NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt Maryland, Printed October; Kuze, A., Kondo, K., Kaneko, Y., (2005) Greenhouse gases observation from the GOSAT satellite, pp. A14C-03. , AGU 2005 Fall Meeting, San Francisco; Michael, B., Heinrich, B., Maximilian, R., Passive satellite remote sensing of carbon dioxide and methane: SCIAMACHY, GOSAT, CarbonSat (2010) Geophys Res Abstracts, 12, p. 6556; Iwata, T., Precision geolocation determination and pointing management for the advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) (2003) Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, pp. 1845-1848; Pu, R.L., Gong, P., (2000) Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and Its Applications, , Beijing: Higher Education Press; Li, X.W., Development and innovation of quantitative remote sensing (2005) J Henan Univ (Nat Sci), 35, pp. 49-56; Feng, M., Liu, S.G., Ned, H.J., Distributed geospatial model sharing based on open interoperability standards (2009) J Remote Sens, 6, pp. 1060-1073; Wang, Q., Wu, C.Q., Li, Q., Chinese HJ-1A/B satellites and data characteristics (2010) Sci China Earth Sci, 53 (SUPPL.
