This, in turn, will decrease the net emission of carbon dioxide. A number of studies exist that calibrate the contribution of various individual, site-specific conservation practices on changes in soil organic carbon. There is a general absence, however, of a comprehensive effort to measure objectively the contribution of these practices including conservation tillage, the Conservation Reserve Program, and conservation buffer strips to an change in soil organic carbon. This paper fills that void. After recounting the evolution of the use of the various conservation practices, it is estimated that organic carbon in the soil in 1998 in the United States attributable to these practices was about 12.2 million metric tons. By 2008, there will be an increase of about 25%. Given that there is a significant potential for conservation practices, which could lead to an increase in carbon sequestration, there are a number of policy options that can be pursued. These include education and technical assistance, financial assistance, research and development, land retirement, and regulation and taxes.","Conservasion; Global climate change; Organic carbon; US agriculture","agricultural practice; climate change; United States",,,,,,"Aase, J., Paul, J., Terrace formation in cropping strips protected by tall wheatgrass barriers (1995) J Soil Water Conserv, 50, pp. 110-112; Barker, J.G., Baumgardner, D., Turner, Lee, J., Carbon dynamics of the conservation and wetland reserve programs (1996) J Soil Water Conserv, 51, pp. 340-346; Beare, M.P., Hendrix, Coleman, D., Water-stable aggregates and organic matter fractions in conventional and no-tillage soils (1994) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 58, pp. 777-786; Black, A., Tanaka, D., A conservation tillage cropping systems study in the northern Great Plains of the United States (1997), pp. 45-83. , Paul E, Paustien K, Elliott E, Cole C (eds) Soil organic matter in temperate agroecosystems.
