BSP) provenance trials established from 1973 to 1977. Population response functions based on February minimum temperatures were developed for 23 Ontario and Great Lakes states provenances to predict climate values maximizing height growth for individual seed sources. Site transfer functions based on February maximum temperatures and May maximum temperatures were developed for five test sites to predict climate values maximizing height growth for test locations. Contour lines representing optimal performance were fitted to current (1961-1990) and future (2041-2070) climate grids. For black spruce seed sources from the east of Lake Superior and Lake Huron, optimal height growth was achieved between 45° and 47°N; for the western sources optimal performance moved north between 46° and 48°N. In eastern Ontario, height growth of northern sources may increase with transfer to warmer environments and with future temperature increases. Central sources are currently growing at or close to optimum and will be negatively affected by increased future temperatures. Southern sources may currently benefit from transfer to cooler environments, and the effects of global warming may cause significant height growth loss and the potential extirpation of local populations.",,"Black spruce seeds; Black spruces; Boreal forests; Central sources; Contour lines; Great lakes; Height growths; Lake superiors; Local populations; Maximum temperatures; Ontario; Optimal growths; Optimal performance; Picea mariana; Provenance tests; Provenance trials; Response functions; Seed sources; Survival datum; Temperature increase; Test sites; Climatology; Forestry; Global warming; Lakes; Optimization; boreal forest; climate effect; coniferous tree; global warming; growth rate; growth response; height; phenology; population decline; provenance trial; Biological Populations; Forestry; Growth; Lakes; Meteorology; Optimization; Picea Mariana; Seeds; Temperature Control; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Picea mariana",,,,,,"Adams, J., Vegetation-climate interaction (2007) How vegetation makes the global environment, , Springer, Berlin; Cherry, M., and Parker, W.H. 2003.
