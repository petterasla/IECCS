Until recently, most estimates have concluded that the temperate forest is a small C source. Two recent papers (Sedjo, 1992; Kauppi et al., 1992) provided evidence that the temperate forests are substantial C sinks. This paper combines these earlier findings on temeperate forest carbon sequestration with a new estimate of the annual C releases due to tropical deforestation, 1.7 Gt, which is obtained using the FAO estimates of the rate of deforestation in the tropics over the decade of the 1980s and conservative estimates of C releases associated with this deforestation. Finally, to this is added the crude estimate of C export by the global river system found in Hall et al. (1992). Applying these estimates of the C sink function of both temperate and tropical forests to Detwiler and Hall's alternative C budgets largely eliminates the ""missing C"" hypothesized by Detwiler and Hall, and Tans et al. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","carbon; carbon cycle; carbon fluxes; carbon sink; deforestation; global warming; tropical and temperate forests","carbon cycle; carbon flux; carbon sink; deforestation; forest ecosystem; global warming; Carbon; Earth atmosphere; Environmental engineering; Forestry; Carbon cycle; Carbon fluxes; Carbon sinks; Deforestation; Global forest ecosystems; Global warming; Temperate forests; Ecosystems; carbon; air pollution; atmosphere; climate; conference paper; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; forest",,,,,,"Armentano, T.V., Ralston, C.W., The role of temperate zone forests in the global carbon cycle (1980) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 10, pp. 53-60; Birdsey, Richard A.: 1990, “Inventory of Carbon Storage and Accumulation in U.S. Forest Ecosystems,” paper presented at the XIX IUFRO World Congress, Montreal Canada, AugustGillespie, Lugo, (1989) Forest Science, 35, pp. 881-902; Clawson, (1979) Science, 204, pp. 1168-74; Detwiler, R.P., Charles, A.S., Hall, (1988) Science, 239, pp. 43-47; (1986) European Timber Trends and Prospects to the Year 2000 and Beyond, , Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (ECE/FAO), United Nations, New York; (1989) Outlook for the forest and forest products sector of the USSR, p. 75. , Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (ECE/FAO), United Nations, New York; (1990) Timber Trends and Prospects for North America, p. 68. , Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (ECE/FAO), United Nations, New York; Estonian Forest Survey Centre. 1992. “Short View About Estonian Forest and Forest Inventory Works, TallinnHall, Marshall, Evenham, (1992) Water.
