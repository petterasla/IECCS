The Nubra Valley (Trans-Himalayan region) is covered with more than 575,000 agroforestry plantations (willow and poplar). These species have been found to sequester more than 75,000 tonnes of carbon. Every year these plantations are contributing 400 tonnes of leaf litter to the ground, which is one of the best sources of soil organic carbon. This communication attempts to suggest some appropriate management practices to improve soil organic carbon pools by analysing available information of agroforestry plants in the Nubra Valley by quantification of biomass contribution by willow and poplar species within the valley and CO2 sequestration rates by the living biomass.","Agroforestry; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sinks; Cold desert lands; Global warming; Trans-Himalayas","Salix",,,,,,"(1995) The Science of Climate Change, , I.P.C.C., Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1996; Dyson, F.J., Can we control the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?
