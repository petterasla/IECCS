NDVI is closely related to the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation; hence, trends in NDVI reflect trends in photosynthetic activity of land-surface vegetation. Linear and nonlinear trend analysis techniques were applied to four differently processed and corrected Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI data sets. The results were compared in order to evaluate the effects of trends in NDVI unrelated to vegetation activity. We consistently found significant positive trends in averaged NDVI for latitude bands above 35°N in all but one data set; this one data set lacked corrections for sensor drift and instrument calibration. An impressive improvement in data quality was achieved by applying calibration and corrections for atmospheric effects. Conservative estimates of the trends over the 1982-99 period range from 0.0015 to 0.0045 NDVI units year-1 for global latitude bands from 35 to 75°N, with trends generally higher in the 1990s than in the 1980s; trends in NDVI were larger than trends explained by artefacts. In the 1980s, North American and Eurasian trends were roughly comparable, whereas in the 1990s the North American trends were generally higher. A pixel-level analysis shows the trends to be widespread, with large areas of Canada, Europe and northern Asia experiencing significant positive increase across all vegetated landcovers.","AVHRR; Climate change; Global vegetation; Global warming; NDVI; Northern latitudes; Satellite vegetation index","global warming; Northern Hemisphere; photosynthetically active radiation; vegetation index",,,,,,"Agbu, P.A., James, M.E., (1994) NOAA/NASA Pathfinder AVHRR Land Data Set User's Manual, , Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt MD; Barber, V.A., Juday, G.P., Finney, B.P., Reduced growth of Alaskan white spruce in the twentieth century from temperature-induced drought stress (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 668-673; Behrenfeld, M.J., Randerson, J.T., McClain, C.R., Biospheric primary productivity during an ENSO transition (2001) Science, 291, pp. 2594-2597; Brest, C.L., Rossow, W.B., Roiter, M.D., Update of radiance calibrations for ISCCP (1997) Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 14, pp. 1091-1109; DeFries, R.S., Hansen, M., Townshend, J.R.G., Global landcover classifications at 8 km spatial resolution: The use of training data derived from landsat imagery in decision tree classifiers (1998) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 19, pp. 3141-3168; Goulden, M.L., Munger, J.W., Fan, S.-M., Exchange of carbon dioxide by a deciduous forest: Response to interannual climate variability (1996) Science, 271, pp. 1576-1578; Gutman, G.G., On the use of long-term global data of land reflectances and vegetation indices derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, pp. 6241-6255; Hansen, J., Ruedy, R., Glascoe, J., GISS analysis of surface temperature change (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, pp. 30997-31022; Holben, B.N., Characteristics of maximum-value composite images for temporal AVHRR data (1986) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 7, pp. 1435-1445; Huang, N.E., Shen, Z., Long, S.R., The empirical mode decomposition and the Hilbert spectrum for nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis (1998) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A-Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences, 454, pp. 903-995; Keeling, C.D., Chin, J.F.S., Whorf, T.P., Increased activity of northern vegetation inferred from atmospheric CO2 measurements (1996) Nature, 382, pp. 146-149; Kerr, R.A., Pinatubo global cooling on target (1993) Science, 259, p. 594; Los, S.O., Calibration adjustment of the NOAA AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index without recourse to component channel 1 and 2 data (1993) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 14, pp. 1907-1917; Los, S.O., Estimation of the ratio of sensor degradation between NOAA-AVHRR channels 1 and 2 from monthly NDVI composites (1998) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 36, pp. 206-213; Los, S.O., (1998) Linkages Between Global Vegetation and Climate: An Analysis Based on NOAA-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Data, , PhD Dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
