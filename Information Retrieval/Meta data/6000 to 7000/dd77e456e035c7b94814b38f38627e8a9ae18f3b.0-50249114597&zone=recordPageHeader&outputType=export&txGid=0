Their relatively small extent poses a serious problem for ground water flow models on the river basin scale. River basin scale models describing the entire water cycle are necessary in integrated water resources management and to study the impact of global climate change on ground water resources. Integrated regional-scale models must use a coarse, fixed discretization to keep computational demands low and to facilitate model coupling. This can lead to discrepancies between model discretization and the geometrical properties of natural systems. Here, an approach to overcome this discrepancy is discussed using the example of the German-Austrian Upper Danube catchment, where a coarse ground water flow model was developed using MODFLOW. The method developed uses a modified concept from a hydrological catchment drainage analysis in order to adapt the aquifer geometry such that it respects the numerical requirements of the chosen discretization, that is, the width and the thickness of cells as well as gradients and connectivity of the catchment. In order to show the efficiency of the developed method, it was tested and compared to a finely discretized ground water model of the Ammer subcatchment. The results of the analysis prove the applicability of the new approach and contribute to the idea of using physically based ground water models in large catchments. © 2008 The Author(s).",,"Agricultural engineering; Catchments; Climate change; Flow of water; Fluid mechanics; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydraulics; Hydrogeology; Information management; Offshore oil well production; Rivers; Runoff; Water analysis; Water management; Water wells; Watersheds; Alluvial aquifers; Computational demands; Discretization; Geometrical properties; Global climate changes; Ground waters; Ground-water flow; Groundwater modelling; Integrated water resources management; Model coupling; MODFLOW; Natural systems; New approaches; Physically based; River basins; Scale modeling; Sub catchments; Subsurface runoff; Water cycling; Watershed scale; Hydraulic models; fresh water; alluvial deposit; aquifer; catchment; comparative study; flow modeling; groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; mountain; river basin; runoff; watershed; algorithm; altitude; article; Austria; geography; Germany; Switzerland; theoretical model; water flow; water supply; Algorithms; Altitude; Austria; Fresh Water; Geography; Germany; Models, Theoretical; Switzerland; Water Movements; Water Supply; Austria; Central Europe; Danube Basin; Eurasia; Europe; Germany",,,,,,"Barth, M., Hennicker, R., Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., DANUBIA: An integrative simulation system for global research in the Upper Danube Basin (2004) Cybernetics and Systems, 35 (78), pp. 639-666. , and; Barthel, R., Mauser, W., Braun, J., Integrated modeling of global change effects on the water cycle in the upper Danube catchment (Germany) - The groundwater management perspective (2007) Groundwater Flow Understanding: From Local to Regional Scale, pp. 47-72. , and.
