Many of these will manifest as adverse health outcomes. This article uses a series of five hypothetical cases to review the climate impacts on the health and well-being of individuals and populations in sub-Saharan Africa. This approach fosters insights into the human dimensions of the risks to health, their interaction with local human ecology, and awareness of the diverse health ramifications of external environmental changes. Each case illustrates the health impact resulting from a specific environmental or social consequence of climate change, including impacts on agriculture and food security, droughts, floods, malaria, and population displacement. Whereas the article focuses on discrete manifestations of climate change, individuals will, in practice, face multiple stresses from climate change (i.e., floods and malaria) concomitant with other non-climate stressors (i.e., HIV/AIDS, globalization, etc.). These multiple sources of vulnerability must be considered when designing climate change and socioeconomic development interventions. © 2009 International Association for Ecology and Health.","Africa; Climate change; Climate change and health; Health and development","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Africa south of the Sahara; article; climate change; drought; ecology; economic development; environmental change; environmental stress; flooding; food availability; food security; health hazard; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; malaria; priority journal; socioeconomics; wellbeing; Africa South of the Sahara; Climate Change; Dehydration; Disease Outbreaks; Droughts; Floods; Food Supply; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Malnutrition; World Health",,,,,,"(2003) Poverty and Climate Change: Reducing the Vulnerability of the Poor Through Adaptation, , http://www.undp.org/energy/povcc.htm[accessedMay16,2008], African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, UK DFID, Netherlands DGIS, European Commission DG for Development, German BMZ, et al; Ahern, M., Kovats, R.S., Wilkinson, P., Few, R., Matthies, F., Global health impacts of floods: Epidemiologic evidence (2005) Epidemiologic Reviews, 27, pp. 36-46. , DOI 10.1093/epirev/mxi004; Arnell, N.W., Climate change and global water resources (1999) Global Environmental Change, 14, pp. 31-S49. , 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.006; Ashton, P.J., Avoiding conflicts over Africa's water resources (2002) Ambio, 31, pp. 236-242; Barrios, S., Bertinelli, L., Strobl, E., Climatic change and rural-urban migration: The case of sub-Saharan Africa (2006) Journal of Urban Economics, 60 (3), pp. 357-371. , DOI 10.1016/j.jue.2006.04.005, PII S0094119006000398; (2007) Million Hit by Floods in Africa, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6998651.stm[accessedApril15,2008], BBC News; Boko, M., Niang, I., Nyong, A., Vogel, C., Githeko, A., Medany, M., (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation, Vulnerability.
