With advantages such as faster clean times, substantially lower emissions of gases having high global warming potentials, and reduced chamber damage, NF 3 plasmas are now favoured over fluorocarbon-based processes. Typically, a remote plasma source (RPS) is used to dissociate the NF3 gas and produce atomic fluorine that etches the CVD residues from the chamber surfaces. However, it is important to efficiently transport F atoms from the plasma source into the process chamber. The current work is aimed at understanding and improving the key processes involved in the production and transport of atomic fluorine atoms. A zero-dimensional model of NF3 dissociation and F production chemistry in the RPS is developed based on various known and derived plasma parameters. Additionally, a model describing the transport of atomic fluorine is proposed that includes both physical (diffusion, adsorption and desorption) and chemical processes (surface and three-body volume recombination). The kinetic model provides an understanding of the impact of chamber geometry, gas flow rates, pressure and temperature on fluorine recombination. The plasma-kinetic model is validated by comparing model predictions (percentage F atom density) with experimental results (etch rates). © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Adsorption; Chemical vapor deposition; Desorption; Diffusion; Dissociation; Flow rate; Fluorine; Fluorocarbons; Gas emissions; Global warming; Semiconductor materials; Cylindrical reaction chamber; Fluorocarbon-based processes; Global warming potentials; Model predictions; Plasma parameters; Reduced chamber damage; Zero-dimensional model; Plasma sources",,,,,,"Johnson, A.A.D., Ridgeway, R.G., Maroulis, P.J., Reducing PFC emissions to the environment through advanced CVD and ETCH processes (2004) IEEE Trans.
