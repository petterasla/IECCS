As natural, enemy efficacy is governed largely by behavioural mechanisms, altered prey finding and prey defence may change insect population dynamics. Here we show that pheromone-mediated escape behaviours, and hence the vulnerability of insects to natural enemies, are divergent under atmospheric conditions associated with global climate change. Chaitophorus stevensis, a common aphid on trembling aspen trees, Populus tremuloides, have diminished escape responses in enriched carbon dioxide (CO2) environments, while those in enriched ozone (O 3) have augmented escape responses, to alarm pheromone. These results suggest that divergent pheromone-mediated behaviours could alter predator-prey interactions in future environments. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Air pollution; Atmospheric change; Bottom-up; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gas; Ozone; Pheromone; Predator-prey; Top-down","behavioral response; climate change; global change; insect; natural enemy; pheromone; predator-prey interaction; Aphididae; Chaitophorus; Hexapoda; Insecta; Populus; Populus tremuloides",,,,,,"Arndt, U., Air pollutants and pheromones - A problem (1995) Chemosphere, 30, pp. 1023-1031; Awmack, C.S., Woodcock, C.M., Harrington, R., Climate change may increase vulnerability of aphids to natural enemies (1997) Ecological Entomology, 22, pp. 366-368; Bezemer, T.M., Jones, T.H., Plant-insect herbivore interactions in elevated atmospheric CO 2: Quantitative analyses and guild effects (1998) Oikos, 82, pp. 212-222; Blatt, S.E., Borden, J.H., Pierce, H.D., Alarm pheromone system of the western conifer seed bug, Leptoglossus occidentalis (1998) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 24, pp. 1013-1031; Ceulemans, R., Janssens, I.A., Jach, M.E., Effects of CO2 enrichment on trees and forests: Lessons to be learned in view of future ecosystem studies (1999) Annals of Botany, 84, pp. 577-590; Coviella, C.E., Trumble, J.T., Effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on insect-plant interactions (1999) Conservation Biology, 13, pp. 700-712; Dani, F.R., Jones, G.R., Destri, S., Deciphering the recognition signature within the cuticular chemical profile of paper wasps (2001) Animal Behaviour, 62, pp. 165-171; Denno, R.F., Gratton, C., Dobel, H., Predation risk affects relative strength of top-down and bottom-up impacts on insect herbivores (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 1032-1044; Dickson, R.E., Lewin, K.F., Isebrands, J.G., (2000) Forest Atmosphere Carbon Transfer Storage-II (FACTS II) - The Aspen Free-air CO2 and O3 Enrichment (FACE) Project: An Overview, , USDA Forest Service North Central Research Station General Technical Report NC-214; Dill, L.M., Fraser, A.H.G., Roitberg, B.D., The economics of escape behaviour in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (1990) Occologia, 83, pp. 473-478; Gate, I.M., McNeill, S., Ashmore, M.R., Effects of air pollution on the searching behaviour of an insect parasitoid (1995) Water, Air and Soil Pollution, 83, pp. 1425-1430; Hassell, M.P., (1978) The Dynamics of Arthropod Predator-Prey Systems, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, USA; Holopainen, J.K., Aphid response to elevated ozone and CO2 (2002) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 104, pp. 137-142; Hunt, G.J., Wood, K.V., Guzman-Novoa, E., Discovery of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetate, a new alarm component in the sting apparatus of Africanized honeybees (2003) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 29, pp. 453-463; Hunter, M.D., Effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on insect-plant interactions (2001) Agricultural and Forest Entomology, 3, pp. 153-159; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , IPCC Report of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
