This paper focuses on an evaluation of the benefit-cost implications of acid rain controls as revealed by two of the five major questions addressed in the NAPAP assessment framework. While the NAPAP effort made significant scientific contributions to the study of acid deposition, key gaps are found in the assessment of benefits and costs most relevant to polity decisions. Lessons learned from NAPAP may be helpful in avoiding similar problems in assessing emerging environmental issues such as global climate change. © 1991 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Desulfurization; Scrubbers; Cost Benefit Studies; Emissions Controls; NAPAP Integrated Assessment; Air pollution control; acid rain; article; cost benefit analysis; acid rain; air pollution; assessment framework; climatic change; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental issue; National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program; policy implication; pollution problem; USA",,,,,,"(1990) Integrated Assessment: Questions 1 and 2, , External Review Draft, National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Washington DC; (1990) Integrated Assessment: Question 3, , External Review Draft, National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Washington DC; (1990) Integrated Assessment: Questions 4 & 5, , External Review Draft, National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Washington DC; (1982) Annual Report, 1982, , National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Washington DC; (1986) Annual Report, 1986, , National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Washington DC; (1989) Annual Report, 1989, , National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Washington DC; Analysis of Alternative Emission Reduction Strategies: Four/Eight Twelve Million Ton Reductions and Ten/Twelve State Reductions (1984) ICF, Inc., Washington, DC; Morrison, M.B., Rubin, E.S., A linear programming model for acid rain policy analysis (1985) JAPCA, 35, p. 1137; Rubin, E.S., Cushey, M.A., Mamicio, R.J., Bloyd, C.N., Skea, J.F., Controlling acid deposition: The role of FGD (1986) Environ.
