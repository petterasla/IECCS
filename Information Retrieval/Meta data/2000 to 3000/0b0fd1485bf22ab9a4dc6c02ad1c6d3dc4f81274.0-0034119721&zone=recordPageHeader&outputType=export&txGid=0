Box 269, Berne, NY 12023-9746, United States","Wetlands exist in a transition zone between aquatic and terrestrial environments which can be altered by subtle changes in hydrology. Twentieth century climate records show that the United States is generally experiencing a trend towards a wetter, warmer climate; some climate models suggest that this trend will continue and possibly intensify over the next 100 years. Wetlands that are most likely to be affected by these and other potential changes (e.g., sea-level rise) associated with atmospheric carbon enrichment include permafrost wetlands, coastal and estuarine wetlands, peatlands, alpine wetlands, and prairie pothole wetlands. Potential impacts range from changes in community structure to changes in ecological function, and from extirpation to enhancement. Wetlands (particularly boreal peatlands) play an important role in the global carbon cycle, generally sequestering carbon in the form of biomass, methane, dissolved organic material and organic sediment. Wetlands that are drained or partially dried can become a net source of methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, serving as a positive biotic feedback to global warming. Policy options for minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change on wetland ecosystems include the reduction of current anthropogenic stresses, allowing for inland migration of coastal wetlands as sea-level rises, active management to preserve wetland hydrology, and a wide range of other management and restoration options.","Carbon reservoirs; Climate change; CO2; Coastal wetland; Peatlands; Permafrost; Prairie pothole; Sea-level rise; Wetlands","climate change; climate effect; vulnerability; wetland; United States",,,,,,"Acock, B., Reddy, V.R., Hodges, H.F., Baker, D.N., McKinion, J.M., Photosynthetic response of soybean canopies to full-season carbon enrichment (1985) Agronomy J., 77, pp. 942-947; Anisimov, O.A., Nelson, F.E., Permafrost distribution in the Northern Hemisphere under scenarios of climatic change (1996) Global and Planetary Change, 14 (1), pp. 59-72; Cahoon, D.R., Day, J.W., Reed, D.R., Young, R.S., Global climate change and sea-level rise: Estimating the potential for submergence of coastal wetlands (1997) Vulnerability of Coastal Wetlands in the Southeastern United States: Climate Change Research Results, pp. 19-32. , U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Science Report, USGS/BRD/BSR 1998-0002; Chapman, W.L., Walsh, J.E., Recent variations of sea ice and air temperature in high latitudes (1994) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 74 (1), pp. 33-47; Clair, T.A., Warner, B.G., Roberts, R., Murkin, H., Lilley, J., Mortsch, L., Rubec, C., Canadian inland wetlands and climate change (1995) Canadian Country Study: Climate Impacts and Adaptations, pp. 189-218. , Environment Canada; Dahl, T.E., (1990) Wetland Losses in the United States, 1780s to 1980s, , U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington D.C., 21 pp; Doyle, T.W., Modeling global change effects on coastal forests (1998) Vulnerability of Coastal Wetlands in the Southeastern United States: Climate Change Research Results, pp. 67-80. , U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Science Report, USGS/BRD/BSR 1998-0002; Drake, B.G., A field study of the effects of elevated CO2 on ecosystem processes in a Chesapeake Bay wetland (1992) Australian Journal of Botany, 40, p. 579595; Drake, B.G., Peresta, G., Beugeling, E., Matamala, R., Long-term elevated CO2 exposure in a Chesapeake Bay wetland: Ecosystem gas exchange, primary production and tissue nitrogen (1996) Carbon Dioxide and Terrestrial Ecosystems, pp. 197-214. , G.
