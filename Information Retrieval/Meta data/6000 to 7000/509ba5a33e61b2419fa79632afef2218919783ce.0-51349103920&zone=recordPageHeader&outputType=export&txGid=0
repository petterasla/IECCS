Land subsidences, high water tide, and inadequate structural measures play important roles in the coastal inundations. Structural and non-structural methods for controlling coastal flooding including dykes, drainage systems, pump stations, polder systems, coastal-land reclamations, coastal planning and management, public education, as well as the establishment of an institutional framework for disaster management have been implemented in the Semarang coastal area. Although some improvements have been made, the current flood management system has generally failed to address a wide range of coastal inundation problems. Some improvement actions have been proposed including stakeholders involvement on the disaster mitigation. For a long period coastal management, accelerated sea level rises due to global warming should also be taken into account. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Coastal area; Flood management; Indonesia; Semarang","Accidents; Coastal zones; Computer networks; Disaster prevention; Drainage; Flood control; Forestry; Global warming; Land reclamation; Management; Oceanography; Offshore oil well production; Sea level; Water levels; Coastal area; Flood management; Indonesia; Semarang; Well flooding; coastal zone management; disaster management; flood control; institutional framework; reclaimed land; sea level change; structural control; Asia; Central Java; Eurasia; Indonesia; Semarang; Southeast Asia",,,,,,"Brilly, M., Polic, M., Public perception of flood risks, flood forecasting and mitigation (2005) Nat Hazard Earth Syst Sci, 5, pp. 345-355; Dewi, A., (2007) Community-based Analysis of Coping with Urban Flooding: A Case Study in Semarang, Indonesia, , M.Sc. thesis, ITC, Enschede, The Netherlands; (2000) Profile of Semarang Coastal Area (in Indonesian), , Development Planning Board (DPB) Development Planning Board of Semarang, Government of Semarang, Indonesia; (2002) Semarang City Planning 2000-2010 (in Indonesian), , Development Planning Board (DPB) Development Planning Board of Semarang, Government of Semarang, Indonesia; (2004) Civil-society and Inter-municipal Cooperation for Better Urban Services/mitigation of Geohazards, , Directorate of Geological and Mining Area Environment (DGME) Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesia; Gatot, I.S., Duchesne, J., Forest, F., Perez, P., Cudennec, C., Prasetyo, T., Karama, S., Rainfall-runoff harvesting for controlling erosion and sustaining upland agriculture development (2001) Selected Papers from the 10th International Soil Conservation Organization Meeting Held, 24-29 May 1999 at Purdue University and the USDA-ARS National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory, pp. 434-441. , Stott DE, Mohtar RH, Steinhardt GC (eds) Sustaining the global farm; Grothmann, T., Reusswig, F., People at risk of flooding: Why some residents take precautionary action while others do not (2006) Nat Hazard, 38, pp. 101-120; Hoozemans, F.M.J., Marchand, M., Pennekamp, H.A., (1993) A Global Vulnerability Analysis, Vulnerability Assessments for Population, Coastal Wetlands and Rice Production on a Global Scale, , 2nd edn Delft Hydraulics and Rijkswaterstaat Delft; (2005) Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015.
