There are many approaches to reduce CO 2 emission and to prevent the global warming, and one of the important approaches is the Intelligent Transport Systems. This article surveys the effects of the ITS on the energy saving and global warming prevention based on the data in Japan, focusing on the applications of vehicular communication technologies. The ITS could contribute to the energy saving on two aspects: one is to eliminate the congestion, which enables each automobile to drive at the fuel optimal speeds, and the other is to provide means for modal shift, which reduces the traffic. This article surveys the ITS technologies for energy saving and CO 2 emission reduction, which include traffic signal control, ETC, route guidance, cruise control, and automated driving. The road-to-vehicle and vehicleto- vehicle communications play an essential role in energy saving as well as in the safety of automobiles and road transportation. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Automated driving; Automobile traffic; Cruise control; Emission reduction; Energy saving; Fuel optimal; Global warming prevention; Intelligent transport systems; Modal shifts; Road transportation; Route guidance; Traffic signal control; Vehicle-to-vehicle communication; Vehicular communications; Ad hoc networks; Automobiles; Energy conservation; Global warming; Roads and streets; Surveys; Traffic signals; Traffic congestion",,,,,,"Tsugawa, S., Sustainable road transportation system\an approach from intelligent transportation systems (2007) JARI Research J., 29 (10), pp. 491-98. , (in Japanese); Matsumoto, S., Comprehensive automobile traffic control systems (1979) IEICE Mag., 62 (8), pp. 870-87. , (in Japanese); Brow, F., Aerodynamic benefits from close following (1997) Automated Highway Systems, pp. 247-64. , P.
