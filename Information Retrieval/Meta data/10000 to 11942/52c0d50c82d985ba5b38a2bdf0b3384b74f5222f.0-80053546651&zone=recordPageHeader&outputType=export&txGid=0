We selected eight ecological variables related to air temperature, which were simulated based on measured air temperature data and the records at the Tianchi meteorological station. Annual stem recruitment of the Betula ermanii (Ermans Birch) population was calculated using tree-ring analysis and field observations. We linked these ecological variables with annual stem recruitment from 1953 to 2008 to examine the relationship between population dynamics and air temperature change. Our results showed that the mean annual rate of air temperature increase was 0.045°C/yr between 1953 and 2008, which was far higher than that of global average warming, suggesting that the study area may be more sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. Different propagation forms and annual stem recruitment of the Betula ermanii population responded significantly to the increase of air temperature. The population first occupied a point niche using the shrub life form during the period 1953-1988, when air temperature increased at a slow pace (0.007°C/yr on average). In contrast, the population expanded its niche rapidly using a single-trunk life form during the period 1988-2008, when air temperature increased at a much faster pace (0.11°C/yr on average). Under global warming, the population expansion and the domain enlargement of Betula ermanii led to a treeline shift. The population has continued to vary its physiological traits to adapt to air temperature change.","air temperature change; Changbai Mountains; diameter-class structure; population dynamics; tree island; treeline shift; warming","air temperature; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem response; environmental factor; global warming; niche; population dynamics; recruitment (population dynamics); temperature effect; treeline; Baekdu Mountain; Changbai Mountains; Betula ermanii",,,,,,"Alftine, K.J., Malanson, P.G., Fagre, D.B., Feedback-driven response to multidecadal climatic variability at an alpine treeline (2003) Physical Geography, 24, pp. 520-535; Bassler, C., Mulle, J., Hothorn, T., Kneib, T., Badeck, F., Dziock, F., Estimation of the extinction risk for high-montane species as a consequence of global warming and assessment of their suitability as cross-taxon indicators (2010) Ecological Indicators, 10, pp. 341-352; Beringer, J., Chapin, F.S., Thompson, C.C., McGuire, A.D., Surface energy exchanges along a tundra-forest transition and feedbacks to climate (2005) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 131, pp. 143-161; Burkett, V.R., Wilcox, D.A., Stottlemyer, R., Barrow, W., Fagre, D., Baron, J., Price, J., Doyle, T., Nonlinear dynamics in ecosystem response to climatic change: Case studies and policy implications (2005) Ecological Complexity, 2, pp. 357-394; Chiang, Y.M., Hsieh, H.H., The use of the Taguchi method with Grey relational analysis to optimize the thin-film sputtering process with multiple quality characteristic in color filter manufacturing (2009) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 56, pp. 648-661; Cullen, L.E., Palmer, J.G., Duncan, P.R., Stewart, G.H., Climate change and tree-ring relationships of Nothofagus menziesii tree-line forests (2001) Canadial Journal of Forest Resources, 31, pp. 1981-1991; Deng, H.B., Hao, Q.Z., Wang, Q.L., The changes of co-possession of plant species between communities with altitudes on north-facing slopes of Changbai Mountain (2001) Journal of Forestry Research, 12 (2), pp. 89-92; Diaz-Varela, R.A., Colombo, R., Meroni, M., Calvo-Iglesias, M.S., Buffonid, A., Tagliaferri, A., Spatio-temporal analysis of alpine ecotones: A spatial explicit model targeting altitudinal vegetation shifts (2010) Ecological Modeling, 221, pp. 621-633; Dole, K.P., Loik, E.M., Sloan, L.C., The relative importance of climate change and the physiological effects of CO2 on freezing tolerance for the future distribution of Yucca brevifolia (2003) Global Planetary Change, 36, pp. 137-146; Dolezal, J., Ishii, H., Kyncl, T., Takahashi, K., Vetrva, V.P., Homma, K., Sumida, A., Hara, T., Climatic factors affecting radial growth of Betula ermanii and Betula platypylla in Kamchatka (2010) Canadian Journal of Forestry Research, 40, pp. 273-285; Dong, M.Y., Wu, F.Z., Jiang, Y., Comparative analysis of temperature change in the regions of Northeast China and Hokkaido, Japan over the last hundred years (2009) Scientia Geographica Sinca, 29, pp. 684-689. , (in Chinese with English abstract); Fan, Z.X., Brauning, A., Cao, F.K., Zhu, S.D., Growth-climate responses of high-elevation conifers in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China (2009) Forest Ecology and Management, 258, pp. 306-313; Gansert, D., Backes, K., Ozaki, T., Kakubari, Y., Seasonal variation of branch respiration of a treeline forming (Betula ermanii Cham) and a montane (Fagus crenata Blume) deciduous broad-leaved tree species on Mt.
