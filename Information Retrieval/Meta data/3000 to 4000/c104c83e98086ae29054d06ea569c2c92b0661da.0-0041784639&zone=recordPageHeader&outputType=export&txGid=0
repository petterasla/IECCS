Potential yields were calculated with a simulation model and a grid with monthly climate data for current (1961-1990) and projected (2010-2039 and 2040-2069) conditions. The results were mapped and summarized for countries. Between 1961-1990 and 2040-2069 the global (terrestrial excluding Antarctica) average temperature is predicted to increase between 2.1 and 3.2 C, depending on the climate scenario. The temperature increase is smaller when changes are weighted by the potato area and particularly when adaptation of planting time and cultivars is considered (a predicted temperature increase between 1 and 1.4 C). For this period, global potential potato yield decreases by 18% to 32% (without adaptation) and by 9% to 18% (with adaptation). At high latitudes, global warming will likely lead to changes in the time of planting, the use of later-maturing cultivars, and a shift of the location of potato production. In many of these regions, changes in potato yield are likely to be relatively small, and sometimes positive. Shifting planting time or location is less feasible at lower latitudes, and in these regions global warming could have a strong negative effect on potato production. It is shown that heat-tolerant potato cultivars could be used to mitigate effects of global warming in (sub)tropical regions.","Adaptation; Geographic information systems; GIS; Heat tolerance; Potential yield; Simulation; Solanum tuberosum","Solanum; Solanum tuberosum",,,,,,"Carter, T.R., Saarikko, R.A., Niemi, K.J., Assessing the risks and uncertainties of regional crop potential under a changing climate in Finland (1996) Agr Food Sci Finland, 5, pp. 329-350; Davies, A., Jenkins, T., Pike, A., Shaq, J., Carson, I., Pollock, C.J., Parry, M.I., Modelling the predicted geographic and economic response of UK cropping systems to climate change scenarios: The case of potatoes (1996) Aspects Appl Biol, 45, pp. 63-69; De Temmerman, L., Bindi, M., Craigon, J., Fangmeier, A., Hacour, A., Pleijel, H., Vandermeiren, K., Wolf, J., (2000) Changing Climate and Potential Impacts on Potato Yield and Quality, , Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre, Tervuren, Belgium; Ewing, E.E., Struik, P.C., Tuber formation in potato: Induction, initiation and growth (1992) Hort Rev, 14, pp. 89-198; Haverkort, A.J., Ecology of potato cropping systems in relation to latitude and altitude (1990) Agr Syst, 32, pp. 251-272; Hijmans, R.J., Global distribution of the potato crop (2001) Am J Potato Res, 78, pp. 403-412; Hijmans, R.J., Condori, B., Carillo, R., Kropff, M.J., A quantitative and constraint-specific method to assess the potential impact of new agricultural technology: The case of frost resistant potato for the Altiplano (Peru and Bolivia) (2003) Agr Syst, 76, pp. 8g5-g11; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M., Van Der Linden, P.J., Xiaosu, D., Maskell, K., Johnson, C.A., (2001) Climate Change 2001.
