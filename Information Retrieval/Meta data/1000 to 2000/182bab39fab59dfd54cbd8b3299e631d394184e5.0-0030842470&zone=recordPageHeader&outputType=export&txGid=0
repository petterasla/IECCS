Recent costly weather-related catastrophes with consequent negative impacts on the insurance industry has made the insurance industry a potential advocate for slowing what has been identified as a causal factor in climate change: emissions of greenhouse gases. However, rising costs of claims, without a longer-term trend of such catastrophic losses, will make it difficult to present a strong case for taking costly economic action. Using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model, it is shown that increasing levels of climate variability as embedded in the anticipated variability of damage to insured assets will have an immediate economic cost that could serve to bolster the argument for more immediate action. That cost is shown to be economically justified higher insurance premiums.","Climate change; Global warming; Insurance; Options","climate change; economic impact; environmental economics; insurance industry; risk increase",,,,,,"Berz, G., Klaus, C., The mounting windstorm risk and consequences for the insurance industry (1994) Ecodecision, 12, pp. 65-68; Deering, A.M., Climate change and the insurance industry (1994) The Earth Observer, 6 (4); Epstein, J.M., Gupta, R., (1990) Controlling the Greenhouse Effect: Five Global Regimes Compared, , Brookings Occasional Papers, Brookings Institution; Firor, J., (1990) The Changing Atmosphere: A Global Challenge, , Yale University Press; Flavin, C., Storm warnings: Climate change hits the insurance industry (1994) World Watch, 7 (6), pp. 11-20. , 10(11); Fosse, E.R., Stanley, A.C., Potential impacts of shifts in climate on the crop insurance industry (1993) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 74 (6), pp. 1703-1708; Flynn, J., Dawley, H., Freundlich, N., Green warrior in gray flannel (1996) Business Week, , May 6; Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, J.J., (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , WMO and UNEP; (1995) IPCC Second Assessment Synthesis of Scientific-technical Information Relevant to Interpreting Article 2 of the un Framework Convention on Climate Change 1995, , UNEP; Ko, M.K.W., Sze, N.-D., Prather, M.J., Better protection for the ozone layer (1994) Nature, , February 10; Lachica, E., Asia faces increasing pressure to act as global warming threatens coasts (1994) The Wall Street Journal, , August 22; Leggett, J., Climate change and the insurance industry (1993) European Environment, 3 (3), pp. 3-8; Leggett, J., Climate change and the insurance industry: Solidarity among the risk community?
