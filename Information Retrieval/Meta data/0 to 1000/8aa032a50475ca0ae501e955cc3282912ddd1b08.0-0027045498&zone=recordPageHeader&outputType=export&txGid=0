There were no strong geographic trends in C storage in biomass, forest floor, or mineral soil across the study area. Storage differed significantly among forest types. Each major C pool was related to a different set of descriptors. Total storage, the sum of all pools, was related to forest type, stand age, available water, actual evapotranspiration, and soil clay content, explaining about 65% of the variation. Differences in the size of C pools, as related to time since disturbance and forest type, indicate that C storage in forests of the Lake States can be influenced by forest management activities. -from Authors",,"aspen; balsam fir; carbon pool; carbon storage; fir; forest floor; jack pine; maple; mineral soil; northern hardwood; pine; red pine; sugar maple; USA, Michigan; USA, Minnesota; USA, Wisconsin; Abies; Abies balsamea; Acer; Acer saccharum; Paragnetina; Pinus banksiana; Pinus resinosa; Populus tremuloides; Saccharum hybrid cultivar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027045498
