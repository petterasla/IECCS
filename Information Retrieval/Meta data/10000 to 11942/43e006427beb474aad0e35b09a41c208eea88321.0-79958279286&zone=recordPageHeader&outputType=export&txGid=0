Centralised and distributed infrastructures were considered along with biogas end uses of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and injection to the gas grid for either transport fuel or domestic heating end uses. Damage orientated (endpoint) life cycle impact assessment method identified that CHP with 80% heat utilisation had the least environmental impact, followed by transport fuel use. Utilisation for domestic heating purposes via the gas grid was found to perform less well. A 32% difference in transportation requirement between the centralised and distributed infrastructures was found to have a relatively small effect on the overall environmental impact. Global warming impacts were significantly affected by changes in methane emissions at upgrading stage, highlighting the importance of minimising operational losses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogas; Biomethane; CHP; LCA; Transport fuel","Biomethane; CHP; Combined heat and power; Distributed infrastructure; Domestic heating; End-uses; Global warming impact; LCA; Life cycle impact assessment; Life-cycle assessments; Methane emissions; Operational loss; Regional scale; Transport fuel; Transportation requirements; Biogas; Damage detection; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Fuels; Global warming; Heating; Methane; Rating; Life cycle; biogas; biogas; environmental impact assessment; global warming; life cycle analysis; methane; article; gas analysis; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; priority journal; Biofuels; Biotechnology; Refuse Disposal; Transportation; Chandipura virus",,"Biofuels",,,,"Berglund, M., Börjesson, P., Assessment of energy performance in the life-cycle of biogas production (2006) Biomass and Bioenergy, 30, pp. 254-266; Bohn, I., Björnsson, L., Mattiasson, B., The energy balance in farm scale anaerobic digestion of crop residues at 11-37°C (2007) Process Biochemistry, 42, pp. 57-64; Börjesson, P., Berglund, M., Environmental systems analysis of biogas systems - Part I: Fuel-cycle emissions (2006) Biomass and Bioenergy, 30, pp. 469-485; Börjesson, P., Berglund, M., Environmental systems analysis of biogas systems - Part II: The environmental impact of replacing various reference systems (2007) Biomass and Bioenergy, 31, pp. 326-344; (2006), BSi.
