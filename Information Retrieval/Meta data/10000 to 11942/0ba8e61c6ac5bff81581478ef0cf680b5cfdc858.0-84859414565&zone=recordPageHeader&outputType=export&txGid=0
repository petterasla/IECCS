The results show that the estimated total direct GHG emissions by the Chinese economy in 2007 amount to 10,657.5 Mt CO 2-eq by the GTPs with 40.6% from CH 4 emissions in magnitude of the same importance as CO 2 emissions. The five sectors of Electric Power/Steam and Hot Water Production and Supply, Smelting and Pressing of Ferrous and Nonferrous Metals, Nonmetal Mineral Products, Agriculture, and Coal Mining and Dressing, are responsible for 83.3% of the total GHG emissions with different emission structures. The demands of coal and coal-electricity determine the structure of emission embodiment to an essential extent. The Construction sector holds the top GHG emissions embodied in both domestic production and domestic consumption. The GHG emission embodied in gross capital formation is more than those in other components of final demand characterized by extensive investment and limited household consumption. China is a net exporter of embodied GHG emissions, with a remarkable share of direct emission induced by international trade, such as textile products, industrial raw materials, and primary machinery and equipment products exports. The fractions of CH 4 in the component of embodied GHG emissions in the final demand are much greater than those fractions calculated by the Global Warming Potentials, which highlight the importance of CH 4 emissions for the case of China and indicate the essential effect of CH 4 emissions on global climate change. To understand the full context to achieve GHG emission mitigation, this study provides a new insight to address China's GHG emissions status and hidden emission information induced by the final demand to the related policy-makers. © 2011 by the authors.","Exergy; Greenhouse gas emissions in China; Input-output embodiment analysis","Chinese economy; Coal electricities; Coal mining; Construction sectors; Direct emissions; Domestic consumption; Domestic production; Electric power; GHG emission; Ghg emission mitigations; Global climate changes; Global warming potential; Hot-water production; Household Consumption; Input-output embodiment analysis; Input-output table; Inventory data; Mineral products; Policy makers; Textile products; Thermodynamic potentials; Beneficiation; Carbon dioxide; Coal mines; Construction industry; Economics; Exergy; Gas emissions; Global warming; Industrial emissions; International trade; Machinery; Nonferrous metals; Greenhouse gases",,,,,,"(2010) CO 2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 2009-Highlights, 2009, , http://www.iea.org/co2highlights/co2highlights.pdf, International Energy Agency (IEA), Available online:, accessed on 3 May; Zhang, Z.X., China in the transition to a low-carbon economy (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 6638-6653; Chen, G.Q., Zhang, B., Greenhouse gas emissions in China 2007: Inventories and input-output analysis (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 6180-6193; Wiedmann, T., Lenzen, M., Turner, K., Barrett, J., Examining the global environmental impact of regional consumption activities-Part 2: Review of input-output models for the assessment of environmental impacts embodied in trade (2007) Ecol.
