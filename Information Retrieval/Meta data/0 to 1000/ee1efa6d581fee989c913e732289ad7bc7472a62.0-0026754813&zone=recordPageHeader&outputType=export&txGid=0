This situation has changed very rapidly and in developed countries CFC use has been eliminated other than in a few essential medical products. Current and likely future air pollutant emissions from aerosol industry products are evaluated in terms of their stratospheric ozone depletion potential, global wanning potential and photochemical ozone creation potential. Environmental impacts of future emissions are likely to be minimal in comparison to those from other air pollution sources. © 1992 Publications Division Selper Ltd.","Aerosol; Chlorofluorocarbons; Global wanning; Ozone depletion","chlorofluorocarbon; ozone; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; article; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; industry; stratosphere",,"ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Gamlen, P.H., Lane, B.C., Midgley, P.M., Steed, J.M., The Production and release to the atmosphere of CCl3F and CCl2F2 (Chlorofluorocarbons CFC-11 and CFC-12).
