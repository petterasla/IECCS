Natural gas is often the most important one, since its use emits carbon dioxide (CO2) far less than other fossil fuels. The use of natural gas is therefore under serious consideration as a strategy to reduce the impact on global warming from coal thermal plants under current technological levels. In this article, a cost minimization model is formulated to investigate the feasibility for this strategy from a long-term economic viewpoint. The model developed is comprised of various strategies such as installing scrubbers, purchasing emission credits, or switching fuels for fossil plants, especially coal-fired thermals, which are currently being implemented or considered by utilities. The implemented results show that substitution of natural gas is less economical than other strategies.Carbon dioxide mitigation provisions of the Framework Convention on Climate Change will require utilities to consider available emission reduction strategies. The use of natural gas to displace coal in thermal power plants is an attractive compliance option, and a cost minimization model is developed to analyze the feasibility of this alternative in the long-term. Scrubbers, emission credits, and fuel switching options are considered, concluding that substitution of natural gas may not be as economical as other strategies. Regulatory and technological factors that undermine the economic competitiveness of the natural gas option are discussed.",,"Coal thermal plants; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel power plants; Global warming; Regulatory compliance; Scrubbers; Natural gas",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Christensen, J.M., Climate change and the need for a new energy agenda (1990) Energy Policy 18, 18 (1), pp. 19-24. , January/February; Amagai, H., Environmental implications of fuel substitution and thermal efficiency: A case study of Japan's electricity sector (1991) Energy Policy 19, 19 (1), pp. 57-62; Andrews, C.J., Govil, S., Becoming proactive about environmental risks: Regulatory reform and risk management in the US electricity sector (1995) Energy Policy, 23 (10), pp. 885-892; Bai, H., Wei, J.H., The CO2 mitigation options for the electric sector (1996) Energy Policy, 24 (3), pp. 221-228; Bernow, S., Dougherty, W., Duckworth, M., Brower, M., An integrated approach to climate policy in the US electric power sector (1998) Energy Policy, 26 (5), pp. 375-393; Biel, A., Lorentzon, S., Olsson, S.O., Natural gas in the Nordic countries: Patterns and prospects (1994) Energy Policy, 22 (3), pp. 227-237. , March; Bohi, D.R., Burtraw, D., Utility investment behavior and the emission trading market (1992) Resource and Energy, 14, pp. 129-153; Bustani, A., Cobas, E., The impact of natural gas imports on air pollutant emissions in Mexico (1993) Energy Journal, 14 (3), pp. 1-15; Chernak, J.M., Emerging environmental markets: Improving the competitiveness of natural gas (1994) Energy, 15 (3), pp. 75-91; Chwee, V., Chaos in natural gas future?
