These include issues of hazardous waste management and the consequent adverse effects of hazardous wastes on human health, the potential disruption of our whole way of life as a consequence of global climate change, and the increasing problem on human health of air pollution and the effects of breathing polluted air. These issues and others were the focus of the 12th meeting of the Pacific Basin Consortium for Environment and Health Sciences, held in Beijing in late 2007. This volume is a collection of papers presented at that meeting, and this introductory chapter provides some perspective on three of the major issues that are of concern in all of the countries in this region. This meeting provided an opportunity for Chinese scientists and those from other countries in the Pacific Basin to share perspectives and possible solutions with others from the international community, and these various approaches are reflected in these proceedings. © 2008 New York Academy of Sciences.","Air pollution; Climate change; e-waste; Hazardous wastes","air pollution; climate change; conference paper; environmental health; environmental protection; hazardous waste; health care; waste management; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; China; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Effect; Health; Health Status; Humans; International Cooperation; Public Health",,"Air Pollutants",,,,"(2000) Toxic Chemicals and Hazardous Waste, , http://www.unep.org/GEO2000/english/0037.htm, United Nations Environment Programme; (2008) Solid Waste in New England: Electronic Waste and Ecycling, , http://www.epa.gov/region1/solidwaste/electronic/index.html, Environmental Protection Agency; Trends in transboundary movement of waste among parties to the Basel convention (2004) UNEP/GRID-Arendal Maps and Graphics Library., , http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/trends-in-transboundary-movement-of- waste-among-parties-to-the-basel-convention, United Nations Environment Programme.
