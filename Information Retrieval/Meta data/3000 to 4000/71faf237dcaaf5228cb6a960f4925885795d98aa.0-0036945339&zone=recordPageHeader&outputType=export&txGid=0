Globally, flooded rice cultivation represents a major source of atmospheric methane that is expected to grow with human population. However, current estimates of global methane flux from rice paddies vary by roughly 50%. Understanding the sources of this large variability is critical for developing management strategies for atmospheric methane. Using data collected each growing season from Texas, USA, rice paddies over a 9-year period we examined the spatial and temporal sources of methane flux variability. Using standard deviation of the mean methane flux as a measured of variability, we found that accounting for rice plant height and grain yield reduced spatial variability from 25.2 to 17.7% of the mean. Temporal variability over the entire 9-year data set was 49% of the mean, 71% of which was explained by variations in average rice plant height and total nitrogen fertilizer application. The magnitude of temporal and spatial variability suggests that reliance on single-field studies for determination of global methane budgets may be questionable.","Atmospheric trace gas; Irrigated rice; Methane emission","biogeochemical cycle; methane; paddy field; soil emission; spatiotemporal analysis",,,,,,"Cao, M., Dent, J.B., Heal, O.W., Modeling methane emission from rice paddies (1995) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 9, pp. 183-195; Cicerone, R.J., Shetter, J.D., Sources of atmospheric methane: Measurements in rice paddies and a discussion (1981) J Geophys Res, 86, pp. 7203-7209; Crout, J.D., Symmank, D.G., Patterson, G.A., (1965) Soil Survey of Jefferson County, Texas, Series 1960, , no. 21, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, Beaumont, Texas, USA; De Bont, J.A., Lee, M.K.K., Bouldin, D.F., Bacterial oxidation of methane in a rice paddy (1978) Ecol Bull, 26, pp. 91-96; Ding, A., Willis, C.R., Sass, R.L., Fisher, F.M., Methane emissions from rice fields: Effect of plant height among several rice cultivars (1999) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 13, pp. 1045-1052; Folorunso, O.A., Rolston, D.E., Spatial variability of field measured denitrification gas fluxes (1984) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 48, pp. 1214-1219; Gee, G.W., Bauder, J.W., Particle size analysis (1986) Methods of Soil Analysis.
