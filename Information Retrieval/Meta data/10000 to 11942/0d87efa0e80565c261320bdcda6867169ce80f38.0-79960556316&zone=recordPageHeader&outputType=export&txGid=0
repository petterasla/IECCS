Our aim was to investigate if biochar may improve plant eco-physiological responses under sufficient water supply as well as moderate drought stress. A fully randomized greenhouse study was conducted with the pseudo-cereal Chenopodium quinoa Willd, using three levels of biochar addition (0, 100 and 200 t ha-1) to a sandy soil and two water treatments (60% and 20% of the water holding capacity of the control), investigating growth, water use efficiency, eco-physiological parameters and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Biochar application increased growth, drought tolerance and leaf-N- and water-use efficiency of quinoa despite larger plant-leaf areas. The plants growing in biochar-amended soil accumulated exactly the same amount of nitrogen in their larger leaf biomass than the control plants, causing significantly decreased leaf N-, proline- and chlorophyll-concentrations. In this regard, plant responses to biochar closely resembled those to elevated CO2. However, neither soil- nor plant-soil-respiration was higher in the larger plants, indicating less respiratory C losses per unit of biomass produced. Soil-N2O emissions were significantly reduced with biochar. The large application rate of 200 t ha-1 biochar did not improve plant growth compared to 100 t ha-1; hence an upper beneficial level exists. For quinoa grown in a sandy soil, biochar application might hence provide a win-win strategy for increased crop production, GHG emission mitigation and soil C sequestration. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biochar; CO2 gas exchange; Halophyte crop; N2O emission; Nitrogen use efficiency; Quinoa; Water use efficiency","agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; crop production; dicotyledon; drought resistance; ecophysiology; gas exchange; global warming; greenhouse gas; growth rate; halophyte; nitrous oxide; sandy soil; soil carbon; soil fertility; water supply; water use efficiency; Chenopodium quinoa",,,,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Rogers, A., The response of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to rising [CO2]: mechanisms and environmental interactions (2007) Plant Cell Environ, 30, pp. 258-270. , doi:10.1111/j.1365-3040.2007.01641.x; Amonette, J.E., Joseph, S., Characteristics of biochar: microchemical properties (2009) Biochar for Environmental Management-Science and Technology, pp. 33-52. , J.
