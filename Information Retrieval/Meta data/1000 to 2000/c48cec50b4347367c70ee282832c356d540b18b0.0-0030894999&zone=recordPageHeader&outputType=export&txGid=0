R0E 1L0, Canada","The environmental assessment of deep geologic disposal of Canadian nuclear fuel waste considers many processes that could affect radionuclide transport to humans over thousands of years. Climatic change is an important feature that will occur over these long times. Glaciation will likely occur within the next 100,000 years over much of Canada, and its impact on radiological doses has been assessed previously. In the present study, we investigate the potential effect of short-term climatic change, usually associated with global warming caused by increases in atmospheric trace gases. We study the main biosphere transport pathways causing a radiological dose to humans from 129I, which is the most important radionuclide in disposal of Canadian used nuclear fuel. Irrigation of a garden with contaminated well water is the main pathway and it can be affected by changes in temperature and precipitation. A cold, wet climate decreases the need for irrigation, and this decreases the radiological dose. A drastic climatic change, such as an increase in temperature from 10 to 20°C and decrease in precipitation from 0.3 to 0.2 m during the growing season, is estimated to increase the dose by a factor of four. This is a relatively small change compared to the range of doses that arise from the variability and uncertainty in many of the parameters used in the environmental assessment models. Therefore, it is likely that the results of probabilistic dose assessment models can include the consequences of short-term climatic change.","dose assessment; iodine; modeling; waste disposal","nuclear fuel; article; biosphere; dosimetry; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; priority journal; radiation dose; waste disposal; water contamination; Agriculture; Canada; Climate; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Radioactive Waste; Temperature; Water Pollution, Radioactive",,"Iodine Radioisotopes; Radioactive Waste",,,,"(1994) Environmental Impact Statement on the Concept for Disposal of Canada's Nuclear Fuel Waste, , Chalk River, ON, Canada: Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd; AECL-10711, COG-93-1; Amiro, B.D., Davis, P.A., A pathways model to assess transport of radionuclides from terrestrial and aquatic surfaces to the atmosphere (1991) Waste Management, 11, pp. 41-57; Amiro, B.D., Laporte, J.M., Thorne, G.A., (1988) Evapotranspiration and Surface Water Balance Measurements at the Whiteshell Research Area, 1985 to 1987, , Chalk River, ON, Canada: Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd.; TR-450; Baes III, C.F., Sharp, R.D., Sjoreen, A.L., Shor, R.W., (1984) A Review and Analysis of Parameters for Assessing Transport of Environmentally Released Radionuclides Through Agriculture, , Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory; ORNL-5786; Berry, M.O., Recent temperature trends in Canada (1991) Operat.
