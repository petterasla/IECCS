The conclusions address both humidity (for which standards and traceability methodologies exist, but need to be developed) and moisture content of materials (for which measurement traceability is more problematic and is not so well developed in general). The roadmap represents a shared vision of how humidity and moisture measurements and standards should develop over the next 15 years to meet future needs, open to revision as needs and technologies evolve. The roadmap identifies the main social and economic triggers that drive developments in humidity and moisture measurements and standards-notably, global warming and advanced manufacturing processes. Stemming from these triggers, key targets that require improved humidity and moisture measurements are identified. In view of global warming, one key target is the development of improved models of climate through improved measurements of atmospheric water vapor. A further target is the reduction of carbon emissions through humidity measurement to optimize industrial heat treatment and combustion processes, and through humidity and moisture measurements to achieve energy-efficient buildings. For high-performance manufacturing, one key target is improved precision control of manufacturing processes through better humidity and moisture measurements. Another key target is contaminant-free manufacture in industries such as microelectronics, through high-purity gases of known moisture content at the parts-per-trillion level. To enable these outcomes, the roadmap identifies the advances needed in measurement standards. These include the following: improved trace humidity standards; new humidity standards to cover high temperatures and pressures, steam, and non-air gases; and improved standards for moisture content of materials. Technologies that are likely to be harnessed are also identified, such as emerging laboratory techniques, existing and new research-grade hygrometers, hygro-thermal modeling, and nanotechnology. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Humidity; Moisture; Roadmap","Advanced manufacturing; Atmospheric water vapor; Carbon emissions; Combustion processes; Energy-efficient buildings; EUROMET; European; High temperatures; High-purity gases; Humidity; Humidity measurements; Humidity standards; Improved models; Industrial heat treatment; Laboratory techniques; Manufacturing processes; Measurement standards; Measurement traceability; Moisture content; Moisture measurements; Precision control; Road maps; Roadmap; Shared vision; Thermal modelling; Trillion level; Air pollution; Conservation; Energy efficiency; Finance; Global warming; Heat treatment; Humidity control; Industrial emissions; Industrial engineering; Industrial management; Investments; Manufacture; Measurements; Meteorological instruments; Meteorology; Microelectronics; Moisture; Moisture control; Moisture determination; Moisture meters; Offshore oil well production; Production engineering; Psychrometers; Standards; Targets; Technology; Vapors; Water vapor; Atmospheric humidity",,,,,,"Implementing Metrology in the European Research Area (IMERA), , http://www.euromet.org/projects/imera","Bell, S.; National Physical Laboratory, Hampton Road, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 0LW, United Kingdom; email: stephanie.bell@npl.co.uk",,,,,,,,0195928X,,IJTHD,,"English","Int J Thermophys",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-52349096929
