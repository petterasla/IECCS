The usefulness of the DPY (difference from the previous year) method was confirmed for removing the watershed change (e.g. land cover, population, etc.). From the analysis of the relationships between air temperature and water temperature on a monthly basis, the delay of time was seen to be negligible, but the gain was reduced due to the high frequency of change. As the amount of precipitation affected their relationship on a yearly basis, the slopes of 1.0-1.2°C water temperature/°C air temperature were determined with the DPY method by excluding the combinations of the years having large difference in annual precipitation. The deterioration of lake water quality, such as increases in COD (chemical oxygen demand) and decreases in transparency, was quantitatively assessed as corresponding to an increase in air temperature. In addition, we found that higher precipitation led to high nitrogen concentrations on a monthly basis, as well as on a yearly basis, probably induced by both the runoff of soilwater having high concentrations and the lowering of residence times of lake water.

The Difference from the Previous Year method was used to account for watershed changes (e.g., land use, population, etc.) in analyzing air temperature-water temperature relationships. This relationship was influenced by the amount of yearly precipitation. Lake water quality deterioration appeared to correspond to increased air temperature. Higher precipitation led to high nitrogen concentrations (on monthly and yearly scales), probably because of soil water runoff having high nitrogen levels and because of shorter lake water residence times.","DPY method; Global warming; Lake water quality; Statistical prediction","Difference from the previous year (DPY) method; Atmospheric temperature; Chemical oxygen demand; Eutrophication; Global warming; Meteorology; Nitrogen; Precipitation (meteorology); Runoff; Statistical methods; Transparency; Water quality; Lakes; climate change; eutrophic environment; forecasting method; global warming; hydrological response; lake water; statistical analysis; water quality; Japan",,,,,,"Clair, T.A., Ehrman, J.M., Variations in discharge and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen export from terrestrial basins with changes in climate: A neural network approach (1996) Limnology and Oceanography, 41, pp. 921-927; Ebise, S., Storm runoff loading of nutrients and pollutants in upper rivers (1991) Japan Journal of Limnology, 52, pp. 241-253; Fee, E.J., Hecky, R.E., Kasian, S.E.M., Cruikshank, D.R., Effects of lake size, water clarity, and climatic variability on mixing depths in Canadian Shield lakes (1996) Limnology and Oceanography, 41, pp. 912-920; Fukushima, T., Muraoka, K., Current and vertical mixing in a shallow lake (1981) Verhandlungen Internationale Vereinigung Limnologie, 21, pp. 141-149; Fukushima, T., Harasawa, H., Carrying capacity and vulnerability of four Asian lakes: A comparative study (1993) Water Resources Development, 9, pp. 87-107; Fukushima, T., Kaminishi, H., Matsushige, K., Harasawa, H., Influence of meteorological conditions on the water quality of a shallow eutrophic lake (1998) Journal of Japan Society of Water Environment, 21, pp. 180-187. , in Japanese with English abstract; Muraoka, K., Fukushima, T., On the box model for prediction of water quality in eutrophic lakes (1986) Ecological Modelling, 31, pp. 221-236; Muraoka, K., Hirata, T., Streamwater chemistry during rainfall events in a forested basin (1988) Journal of Hydrology, 102, pp. 235-253; Poff, N.L., Tokar, S., Johnson, P., Stream hydrological responses to climate change assessed with an artificial neural network (1996) Limnology and Oceanography, 41, pp. 857-863; Porter, K.G., Saunders, P.A., Haberyan, K.A., Macubbin, A.E., Jacobsen, T.R., Hodson, R.E., Annual cycle of autotrophic and heterotrophic production in a small monomictic Piedmont lake (Lake Oglethorpe): Analog for the effects of climatic warming on dimictic lakes (1996) Limnology and Oceanography, 41, pp. 1041-1051; Sado, K., Fundamental study of heat balance of river water (1983) Proceedings of Japan Society of Civil Engineers, 330, pp. 69-79. , in Japanese with English abstract; Schindler, D.W., Bayley, S.E., Parker, B.R., Beaty, K.G., Cruikshank, D.R., Fee, E.J., Schindler, E.U., Slainton, M.P., The effects of climatic warming on the properties of boreal lakes and streams at the experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario (1996) Limnology and Oceanography, 41, pp. 1004-1017; Schindler, D.W., Beaty, K.G., Fee, E.J., Cruikshank, D.R., DeBruyn, E.R., Findlay, D.L., Linsey, G.A., Turner, M.A., Effects of climatic warming on lakes of the central boreal forest (1990) Science, 250, pp. 967-970; Smith, J.B., Tirpak, D., (1989) The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change on the United States, , USEPA: Washington, DC; Takara, K., Kojiri, T., Numerical experiments on effects of global warming on catchment response change (1993) Journal of Hydraulic, Coastal and Environmental Engineering, 489, pp. 1-10. , in Japanese with English abstract; Williams, M.W., Losleben, M., Caine, N., Greenland, D., Changes in climate and hydrochemical responses in a high-elevation catchment in the Rocky Mountains, USA (1996) Limnology and Oceanography, 41, pp. 939-946; Wolford, R.A., Bales, R.C., Hydrochemical modelling of Emerald Lake watershed, Sierra Nevada, California: Sensitivity of stream chemistry to changes in fluxes and model parameters (1996) Limnology and Oceanography, 41, pp. 947-954","Fukushima, T.; Dept. of Civil and Envirl.
