Japan's annual CO2 emissions (fiscal 1994) amounted to 343 million tons of carbon. Although CO2 emissions caused by fossil-fuel power generation accounted for 29.4% of total, on a sector basis, those directly from the energy conversion sector accounted for only 7.7%. Most CO2 emissions (21.7% of total) resulted from electric power use in the industrial, commercial and domestic sectors. Thus, the reduction of CO2 emissions caused by the use of electricity is a nationwide subject. Understanding that both supply side and demand side approaches are necessary, Kansai Electric has been deploying ""New ERA Strategy"" as a comprehensive strategy to seek a potential for CO2 reduction more broadly and deeply. Among a number of action items are the promotion of nuclear power generation, and improvement of overall energy efficiency, besides such demand side measures as leveling off the peak load. The effectiveness of action items of the New ERA Strategy was evaluated in terms of CO2 reduction. As a result, estimated CO2 reduction related to nuclear power amounted to 88% of the total for fiscal 1995 in comparison with 1990, and that expected in 2000 is 84%. These results reconfirm that nuclear power is always the key to practical CO2 reduction at present and in the future. Comparison with candidate technology alternatives revealed that photovoltaic power generation needed 7 times greater rated capacity and 280 times larger area than nuclear power, so it is not realistic as a central power station alternative. The comparison also clarified that if wind power stations were constructed at all feasible sites in the Kansai region, they would not be a viable alternative to a single nuclear unit from CO2 reduction viewpoint. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Electric power systems; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Power generation; Wind power; Fossil fuel power generation; Nuclear power generation; Photovoltaic power generation; Wind power stations; Nuclear energy",,,,,,"(1997) IPCC Second Assessment Report, , Chuohoki Publishing Co., Ltd.
