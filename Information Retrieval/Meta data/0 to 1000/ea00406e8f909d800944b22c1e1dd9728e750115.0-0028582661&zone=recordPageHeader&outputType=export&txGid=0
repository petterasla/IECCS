It is found to work sufficiently well in the area of interest, the Mediterranean Basin. For a network of 248 Mediterranean temperature stations, present-day seasonal mean potential evapotranspiration is estimated by this method. -from Authors",,"climate change; evapotranspiration; global warming; greenhouse effect; moisture availability; precipitation; Mediterranean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08998418,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028582661
