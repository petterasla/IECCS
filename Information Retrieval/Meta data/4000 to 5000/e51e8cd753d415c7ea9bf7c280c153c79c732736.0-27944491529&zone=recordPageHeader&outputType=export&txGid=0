In 2000 there were 69 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants of which 9 of them exceeded one million population, totalizing 53.4 million. Using time series of mean monthly temperature for about a dozen available stations, this paper sets out to examine temperature changes occurring during the late 20th century. Since it is well established that urban warming is mainly a nocturnal phenomenon minimum temperature series were selected after a test for homogeneity. Trend analysis was applied to the minimum temperature series and a linear regression coefficient was obtained. Tests of significance were performed. Most of the positive trends proved to be significant (&gt;90%). Although temperature trend variability amongst the individual cities was large (from 0.02°C/decade to 0.74 °C/decade) average temperature increase in large (≥106 inhabitants) cities was (0.57 °C/decade) considerably higher than that corresponding to medium size urban centers where on the average temperature increase was 0.37 °C/decade. These temperature increases express not only the urbanization effect but also that due to global climate change (of the order of 0.07 °C/decade) and natural variability. In concluding it may be said that increasing urbanization in México has originated a positive trend in urban temperatures which has implications for human comfort and health.","Heat island; México; Urban warming","air temperature; heat island; twentieth century; urban atmosphere; urbanization; warming; Mexico [North America]; North America",,,,,,"Chandler, T.J., Urban Climatology and its relevance to urban design (1976), WMO Tech Note No. 149, WMO, Geneva(2001) Consejo Nacional De Población, , CONAPO, Secretaría de Gobernación.
