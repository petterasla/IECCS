Goodwin Ave., Urbana, IL 61801, United States","Species in the Miscanthus genus have been proposed as biofuel crops that have potential to mitigate elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels and nitrous oxide (N 2O) and methane (CH 4) emissions. Miscanthus sinensis is widespread throughout Japan and has been used for biomass production for centuries. We assessed the carbon (C) budget and N 2O and CH 4 emissions over the growing season for 2 years in a M. sinensis-dominated grassland that was naturally established around 1972 in Tomakomai, Hokkaido, Japan, which is near the northern limit for M. sinensis grassland establishment on Andisols. Average C budget was -0.31MgCha -1, which indicates C was released from the grassland ecosystem to the atmosphere. Dominant components in the C budget appeared to be aboveground net primary production of plants (1.94-2.80MgCha -1) and heterotrophic respiration (2.27-3.11MgCha -1). The measurement of belowground net primary production (BNPP) of plants in the M. sinensis grassland was extremely variable, thus only an approximate value could be calculated. Mean C budget calculated with the approximated BNPP value was 1.47 and -0.23MgCha -1 for 2008 and 2009, respectively. Given belowground biomass (9.46-9.86MgCha -1) was 3.1-6.5 times higher than that of aboveground biomass may provide additional evidence suggesting this grassland represents a C sink. Average CH 4 emissions across years of -1.34kgCha -1 would indicate this grassland acts as an atmospheric CH 4 sink. Furthermore, average N 2O emissions across years were 0.22kgNha -1. While the site may contribute N 2O to the atmosphere, this value is lower compared with other grassland types. Global warming potential calculated with the approximated BNPP value was -5.40 and 0.95MgCO 2Eqha -1 for 2008 and 2009, respectively, and indicates this grassland could contribute to mitigation of global warming. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bioenergy; Biofuel; Carbon; Grassland; Greenhouse gas; Miscanthus; Susuki",,,,,,,"Akiyama, H., Yan, X., Yagi, K., Estimations of emission factors for fertilizer-induced direct N 2O emissions from agricultural soils in Japan (2006) Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 52, pp. 774-787. , summary of available data; Berg, W.K., Cunningham, S.M., Brouder, S.M., Joern, B.C., Johnson, K.D., Volenec, J.J., Influence of phosphorus and potassium on Alfalfa yield, taproot C and N pools, and transcript levels of key genes after defoliation (2009) Crop Science, 49, pp. 974-982; Berry, J.A., Björkman, O., photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants (1980) Annual Review of Plant Physiology, 31, pp. 491-543; Boeckx, P., Van Cleemput, O., Estimates of N 2O and CH 4 fluxes from agricultural lands in various regions in Europe (2001) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 60, pp. 35-47; Boone, R.D., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Canary, J.D., Kaye, J.P., Roots exert a strong influence on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (1998) Nature, 396, pp. 570-572; Bouwman, A., Boumans, L.J.M., Batjes, N.H., (2001) Global Estimates of Gaseous Emissions of NH 3, NO and N 2O from Agricultural Land, , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy; Cahill, K.N., Kucharik, C.J., Foley, J.A., Prairie restoration and carbon sequestration (2009) Ecological Applications, 19, pp. 2185-2201. , difficulties quantifying C sources and sinks using a biometric approach; Clifton-Brown, J.C., Breur, J., Jones, M.B., Carbon mitigation by the energy crop, Miscanthus (2007) Global Change Biology, 13, pp. 2296-2307; Clifton-Brown, J.C., Lewandowski, I., Bangerth, F., Jones, M.B., Comparative responses to water stress in stay-green, rapid- and slow senescing genotypes of the biomass crop, Miscanthus (2002) New Phytologist, 154, pp. 335-345; Clifton-Brown, J.C., Long, S.P., Jørgensen, U., Humphries, S.A., Schwarz, K.U., Schwarz, H., Miscanthus productivity (2001) Miscanthus for Energy and Fibre, pp. 46-67. , (eds Jones MB, Walsh M).
