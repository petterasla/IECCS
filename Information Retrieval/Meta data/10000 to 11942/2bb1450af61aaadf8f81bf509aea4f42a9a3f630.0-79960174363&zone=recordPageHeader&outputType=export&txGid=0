The fermentation of DWW was carried out with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus lactis) to produce biohydrogen which was converted to the electrical energy through the development of microbial fuel cell (MFC). The values of COD, BOD, and BOD 5 for yogurt fermented domestic wastewater (Yogurt-FDWW) were found to be greater than the values of yeast fermented domestic wastewater (Yeast-FDWW). The power output of DWW and FDWW was increased with the increase in COD, BOD and BOD 5 values. The main objective of this article is to develop the renewable alternative of fossil fuels which are the major cause of global warming and global pollution.",,,,,,,,"Khan, A.M., Ali, M.M., Naz, S., Sohail, M., (2010) Journal of the Chemical Society of Pakistan, 32 (2), p. 209; Khan, A.M., (2009) Advances in Natural and Applied Sciences, 3 (2), p. 279; Oh, S.E., Logan, B.E., (2005) Water Research, 39, p. 4673; Cheng, S., Liu, H., Logan, B.E., (2006) Electrochemistry Communications, 8, p. 489; Thurston, C.F., Bennetto, H.P., Delaney, G.M., Mason, J.R., Roller, S.D., Stirling, J.L., (1985) Journal of General Microbiology, 131, p. 1393; Moore, W.A., Kroner, R.C., Ruchhoft, C.C., (1949) Analytical Chemistry, 21, p. 953; Ahmed, T., Bram, K., Fatma, E.G., Gratze, L., (2002) Water Research, 36 (1), p. 147; Karim, S., Chaudhry, M.N., Ahmed, K., Batool, A., Journal of the Chemical Society of Pakistan, 32 (606), p. 2010; Latif, A., Noor, S., Shareef, Q.M., Najeebullah, M., Journal of the Chemical Society of Pakistan, 32 (115), p. 2010; Eaton, A.D., Clesceri, L.S., Greenberg, A.E., (1995) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, and Wastewater, , (Eds.), 19 th Edition, American Public Health Association, Washington, DC, APHA; Winkler, L.W., (1888) Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft, 21, p. 2843; Eaton, A.D., Clesceri, L.S., Greenberg, A.E., (1998) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, and Wastewater, , (Eds.), 20 th Edition, American Public Health Association Method 4500-OB.
