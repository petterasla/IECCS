One of the candidates is CO2 gas, which has lower global warming potential (GWP). However, CO2 gas has a lower withstand voltage level than SF6 gas; therefore, it is necessary to rationalize the equipment insulation level and reexamine the insulating test voltage for electric power apparatus as low as possible. From our previous investigation, in SF6 gas insulation system, we obtained that the insulation requirements of the real surges (called nonstandard lightning impulse waveform) are not as severe as those of the standard lightning impulse waveform. This paper describes the evaluation method for real surges, based on insulation characteristics of CO2 gas gaps. Furthermore, the method was applied to typical field overvoltage waveform in the lightning surge time region for 500-kV systems and it is obtained that the equivalent peak value of the standard lightning impulse waveform is possibly reduced by 10 to 15%. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Co2; Evaluation method; Field overvoltage waveform; GIS; Insulation characteristics; Nonstandard lightning impulse waveform","Dielectric devices; Electric power distribution; Electric switchgear; Greenhouse gases; Waveform analysis; Field overvoltage waveform; Nonstandard lightning impulse waveform; Oscillators (electronic)",,,,,,"Efficiency in insulation design (1988) Electr Technol Res Assn, 44 (3). , Electric Technology Research Association; Yuasa, S., Suzuki, H., Okabe, S., Insulation characteristics of GIS under non-standard lightning impulse oscillations-Insulation characteristics under single-frequency oscillations with various conditions (2002) Trans IEE Japan, 122-B, pp. 1035-1041. , in Japanese For example; Okabe, S., Yuasa, S., Evaluation method of non-standard lightning impulse waveforms for GIS (2004) IEEE Trans PE, 124, pp. 156-161. , in Japanese; Goshima, H., Shinkai, H., Yashima, M., Lightning impulse breakdown characteristics of high-pressure N2 as an alternative insulation gas to SF6 (2004) Proc 9th International Symposium on Gaseous Dielectrics, pp. 359-364; Juhre, K., Kynast, E., High pressure N2, N2/CO 2 and CO2 gas insulation in comparison to SF6 in GIS applications (2005) Proc 14th ISH, pp. C-01; Yuasa, S., Fujihara, H., Okabe, S., Insulation characteristics Of CO 2 gas gap under non-standard lightning impulse oscillatory waveform (2003) Proc 14th Annual Conference of Power & Energy Society, B, pp. 275-276. , IEE Japan, in Japanese; Kaneko, S., Yokoi, T., Okabe, S., Insulation characteristics of CO2 gas for non-standard lightning impulse oscillation-Effect of damping time with high frequency oscillation (2005) Proc 16th Annual Conference of Power & Energy Society, 361. , IEE Japan, in Japanese; (1986) SFg gas V-t characteristics.
