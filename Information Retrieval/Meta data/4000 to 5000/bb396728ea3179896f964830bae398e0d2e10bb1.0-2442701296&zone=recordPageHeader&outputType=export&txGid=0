The multimodel data utilized are the long-term integration of six atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and the downscaling method is based on the singular value decomposition with the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) truncation to correct the systematic bias in the dynamic models. Interestingly, even though prediction skill in the training period is increased with increasing number of AOGCMs used, the skill is often decreased in the independent period. It is found that prediction skill in the independent period continues to rise when we use an optimal combination of predictors. The optimum combination used in constructing the superensemble model is the super-3 ensemble, which is a combination of three AOGCMs (CCCma, CSIRO, and NCAR) among the six AOGCMs used in this study. In general, the first four EOFs of sea-level pressure (SLP) in the super-3 ensemble are very similar to those of the observed SLP. The dynamic link between Korean winter precipitation and East Asian monsoon circulation in the super-3 ensemble is similar to that of the observed indicating that the super-3 ensemble realistically simulates the circulations in the East Asian monsoon region. The cross-validation for the prediction of the super-3 ensemble shows that the correlation skill score is about 0.49, which is significant at the 5% level. The results provide hope for regional climate prediction in decadal time-scales using superensemble methods together with statistical downscaling. © 2004 Royal Meteorological Society.","Atmospheric circulation; Decadal time scale; Downscaling; East Asia; General circulation models; Korea; Rainfall; Superensemble","Data acquisition; Integration; Observatories; Optimization; Sea level; Signal filtering and prediction; Downscaling; Ensemble; Seasonal precipitation; Condensation; atmospheric general circulation model; ensemble forecasting; precipitation (climatology); weather forecasting; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea",,,,,,"Barnett, T.P., Preisendorfer, R., Origins and levels of monthly and seasonal forecast skill for United States surface air temperatures determined by canonical correlation analysis (1987) Monthly Weather Review, 115, pp. 1825-1850; Barnston, A.G., Linear statistical short-term climate predictive skill in the Northern Hemisphere (1994) Journal of Climate, 7, pp. 1513-1564; Benestad, R.E., Empirically downscaled multimodel ensemble temperature and precipitation scenarios for Norway (2002) Journal of Climate, 15, pp. 3008-3027; Brethern, C.S., Smith, C., Wallace, J.M., An intercomparison of methods for finding coupled patterns in climate data (1992) Journal of Climate, 5, pp. 541-560; Busuioc, A., von Storch, H., Changes in the winter precipitation in Romanis and its relation to the large-scale circulation (1996) Tellus Series A: Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography, 48, pp. 538-552; Emori, S., Nozawa, T., Abe-Ouchi, A., Numaguti, A., Kimoto, M., Nakagima, T., Coupled ocean-atmosphere model experiments of future climate change with an explicit representation of sulfate aerosol scattering (1999) Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan, 77, pp. 1299-1307; Feddersen, H., Navarra, A., Ward, M.N., Reduction of model systematic error by statistical correction for dynamic seasonal prediction (1999) Journal of Climate, 12, pp. 1974-1989; Flato, G.M., Boer, G.J., Lee, W.G., McFarlane, N.A., Ramsden, D., Reader, M.C., Weaver, A.J., The Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis global coupled model and its climate (1999) Climate Dynamics, 16, pp. 451-467; Glahn, H.R., Statistical weather forecasting (1985) Probability, Statistics, and Decision Making in the Atmoshperic Sciences, pp. 289-335. , Westview Press; Graham, N.E., Barnett, T.P., Wilde, R., Ponater, M., Schubert, S., On the roles of tropical and midlatitude SSTs in forcing interannual to interdecadal variability in the winter Northern Hemisphere circulation (1994) Journal of Climate, 7, pp. 1416-1448; Hirst, A.C., O'Farrell, S.P., Gordon, H.B., Comparison of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model with and without oceanic eddy-induced advection.
