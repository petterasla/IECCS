Global warming induces steric as well as eustatic rise in sea-level, by thermal expansion and addition of ice-melt water, respectively. Although the IPCC (2007) estimated a maximum possible sea-level rise of about 59 cm, more recent estimates show a global average rise of ≥1 m by the 2100 AD. The low-lying coastal zones are more vulnerable to rising sea levels as they face submergence or saltwater intrusion which affects the agriculture activities. Geomatics-based models on the possible impact of the predicted sea-level rise on coastal agriculture are necessary to initiate appropriate mitigation plans. The present study is an attempt in this direction taking the Andhra Pradesh (AP) coast as an example. The land use / land cover of the AP coast was mapped through the interpretation of IRS-P6 LISS III imagery from 2008. SRTM digital elevation models coupled with landform evidences have been used to interpolate contours at 0.5 m interval, although highly approximate, for the entire coastal region. If the sea level rises by 1.0 m, about 4040 km 2 area including the present intertidal wetlands as well as the land between the present and future high tide lines would be affected along the entire 1030-km-long AP coast displacing about 1.67 million inhabitants and their economic activities, in about 351 revenue villages. The low-lying Krishna-Godavari delta region in the central part of the AP coast would be the worst affected zone as 2205 km 2 of its area including about 1593 km 2 under various types of agricultural activities is lying within the future high tide limit of 2. 5 m elevation. © 2011 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Andhra Pradesh coast; Geomatics analysis; Impact on coastal agriculture; Sea-level rise","agricultural practice; agricultural production; anthropogenic effect; climate change; coastal zone; deforestation; drought; economic analysis; emission; flood; global warming; greenhouse gas; land cover; land use; numerical model; saline intrusion; sea level change; vulnerability; wetland; Andhra Pradesh; Godavari Delta; India; Krishna Delta",,,,,,"Ahn, J., Brook, E.J., Atmospheric CO 2 and climate on millennial time scales during the last glacial period (2009) Science, 322, pp. 83-85; Alexander, D., Nasheed, M., (2009) Climate: Rich and poor must work together, , http://www.thehindu.com/2009/11/11/stories/2009111155650900.htm, Accessed 08 April 2008; Allen, J.C., Komar, P.D., Climate controls on US west coast erosion processes (2006) Journal of Coastal Research, 22, pp. 511-529; Baskaran, R., Coastal erosion (2004) Current Science, 86, p. 25; Dash, S.K., Hunt, J.C.R., Variability of climate change in India (2007) Current Science, 93, pp. 782-788; Finerin, D., (2009), http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL13885723, Accessed 08 April 2011Ghosh, B., Numerical modeling of saltwater intrusion due to human activities and sea level change in the Godavari delta, India (2002) Hydrological Sciences Journal, 47, pp. 67-80; Goodwin, P., Williams, R.G., Ridgwell, A., Follows, M.J., Climate sensitivity to the carbon cycle modulated by past and future changes in ocean chemistry (2009) Nature Geoscience, 2, pp. 145-150; Hema Malini, B., Nageswara Rao, K., Coastal erosion and habitat loss along the Godavari delta front-a fallout of dam construction (?)
