A climatic warming trend (r = 0.615, P < 0.001; 0.35°C/decade) was evident during the twentieth century, with peak precipitation occurring from 1970 to 1990. Five major wetg""dry cycles, based on net water balance values (precipitation minus potential evaporation), were evident with peaks occurring at about 17(±3) year intervals. Each cycle became slightly less arid than the previous until the mid-1990s. Deciduous forests dominated upland sites in 2004, whereas deciduous shrub and juvenile tree stands comprised 78% in 1950. Total wetland area remained relatively constant between 1950 and 2004, but less meadow and more standing water were present in 2004. Lake-surface area changes suggested that wetlands were recharged by precipitation rather than floodwaters from the nearby Peace River. Low water availability and historical descriptions suggest grassland-dominated parkland-like vegetation occurred in the study area during the early part of the twentieth century, with upland shrubs replacing grasslands by 1950. Increased atmospheric water availability rather than cessation of aboriginal burning or natural fires was considered responsible for increased forest abundance after 1945. Greater aridity in response to future global warming could reduce the abundance of forests in the lower Peace River district, and shift the regional climate from a boreal to a grassland-dominated parkland climatic regime.","Aboriginal burning; Boreal forest; Landscape ecology; Late-Holocene climate; Parkland; Water balance","aridity; boreal forest; burning; climate change; grassland; Holocene; indigenous population; precipitation (climatology); proxy climate record; twentieth century; vegetation dynamics; vegetation mapping; warming; water availability; water budget; wetland; Canada; North America; Peace River [Canada]",,,,,,"Anderson, H.G., Bailey, A.W., Effects of annual burning on grassland in the aspen parkland of east-central Alberta (1980) Canadian Journal of Botany, 58, pp. 958-96; Bartos, D.L., Mueggler, W.F., Early succession in aspen communities following fire in western Wyoming (1981) Journal of Range Management, 34, pp. 315-18; Bird, R.D., (1961) Ecology of the aspen parkland of western Canada in relation to land use, p. 1066. , Canada Department of Agriculture, Publication; Bradley, R.S., Diaz, H.F., Eischeid, J.K., Jones, P.D., Kelly, P.M., Goodess, C.M., Precipitation fluctuations over northern hemisphere land areas since the mid-19th century (1987) Science, 237, pp. 171-75; Campbell, C., Campbell, I.D., Blyth, C.B., McAndrews, J.H., Bison extirpation may have caused aspen expansion in western Canada (1994) Ecoscience, 17, pp. 360-62; Coupland, R.T., A reconsideration of grassland classification in the northern Great Plains of North America (1961) Journal of Ecology, 49, pp. 136-67; Davi, N.K., Jacoby, G.C., Wiles, G.C., Boreal temperature variability inferred from maximum latewood density and tree-ring width data, Wrangell Mountain region, Alaska (2003) Quaternary Research, 60, pp. 252-62; Delisle, G.P., Hall, R.J., (1987) Forest fire history maps of Alberta, 1931 to 1983 (scale 1:500,000), , Canadian Forest Service; Dunne, T., Leopold, L.B., (1978) Water in environmental planning, , Freeman; Dyke, A.S., Prest, V.K., (1987) Paleogeography of North America, 18,000-6,000 years ago (1:12,500,000 scale), , Geological Survey of Canada, Map 1703A; Ecoclimatic regions of Canada, first approximation.
