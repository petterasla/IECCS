To search for an environmental-friendly and economical fusion reactor system, comparative system studies have been done for several magnetic fusion energy reactors, and have been extended to include inertial fusion energy reactors. We clarify new scaling formulae for the cost of electricity and GHG emission rate with respect to key design parameters, which might be helpful in making a strategy for fusion research development. Comparisons with other conventional electric power generation systems are carried out taking into account the introduction of GHG taxes and the application of the carbon dioxide capture and storage system to fossil power generators. © 2011 IAEA, Vienna.",,"Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Cost of electricity; Economic assessments; Electric power; Environmental-friendly; Fusion research; GHG emission; Inertial fusion energy; Key design parameters; Magnetic fusion energy; System study; Carbon dioxide; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Electricity; Fusion reactors; Gas emissions; Global warming; Inertial confinement fusion; Laser fusion; Greenhouse gases",,,,,,"Yamazaki, K., (2009) Nucl.
