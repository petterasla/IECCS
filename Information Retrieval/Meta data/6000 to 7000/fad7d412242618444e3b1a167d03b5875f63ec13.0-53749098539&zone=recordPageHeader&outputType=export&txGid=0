Using occupancy modeling to control for variation in detectability, we show substantial (∼500 meters on average) upward changes in elevational limits for half of 28 species monitored, consistent with the observed ∼3°C increase in minimum temperatures. Formerly low-elevation species expanded their ranges and high-elevation species contracted theirs, leading to changed community composition at mid- and high elevations. Elevational replacement among congeners changed because species' responses were idiosyncratic. Though some high-elevation species are threatened, protection of elevation gradients allows other species to respond via migration.",,"climate effect; community composition; ecological impact; ecological modeling; elevation; endangered species; global warming; habitat conservation; migration; national park; range expansion; replacement; small mammal; twentieth century; animal community; article; climate change; geographic elevation; greenhouse effect; health survey; history; land use; mammal; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; species identification; United States; warming; Acclimatization; Altitude; Animal Migration; Animals; Biodiversity; California; Climate; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Mammals; Population Dynamics; Temperature; Time Factors; California; North America; United States; Yosemite National Park; Mammalia",,,,,,"(2007) Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report Contribution of Working Groups I, II, and III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland; Rosenzweig, C., (2008) Nature, 453, p. 353; Parmesan, C., Yohe, G., (2003) Nature, 421, p. 37; Walther, G.R., (2002) Nature, 416, p. 389; Parmesan, C., (2006) Annu.
