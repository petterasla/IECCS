However, the use of CO2 as a refrigerant requires a refrigeration cycle with greater extremes of pressure, placing greater demands on the polymer materials used for seals and packing. In this work we have measured the solubility and diffusivity of gaseous CO2 in two polymers used as sealing materials in CO2 refrigeration plants. These are Hydrogenated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (HNBR) and Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) which are used in seals such as O-rings. The experiments were performed on a high-pressure microbalance. Solubility results were modelled using an equation of state for polymers (simplified PC-SAFT). The necessary polymer parameters were obtained using a previously published method. The measured results can be successfully correlated using simplified PC-SAFT. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.","Carbon dioxide; Diffusivité; Diffusivity; Dioxyde de carbone; Équation d'état; Equation of state; Joint; Matériau; Material; Measurement; Mesure; Modélisation; Modelling; Polymère; Polymer; Refrigeration system; Seal; Solubilité; Solubility; Système frigorifique","Diffusivities; Dioxyde de carbone; Equation of state; Joint; Material measurements; Refrigeration system; Butadiene; Capillary tubes; Carbon dioxide; Cyanides; Diffusion; Equations of state; Ethylene; Global warming; O rings; Packing; Polymer blends; Polymers; Propylene; Refrigerants; Refrigerating machinery; Refrigerators; Sealants; Solubility; Synthetic apertures; Ternary systems; Refrigeration",,,,,,"Fitch, M.W., Koros, W.J., Nolen, R.L., Carnes, J.R., Permeation of several gases through elastomers, with emphasis on the deuterium/hydrogen pair (1993) J.
