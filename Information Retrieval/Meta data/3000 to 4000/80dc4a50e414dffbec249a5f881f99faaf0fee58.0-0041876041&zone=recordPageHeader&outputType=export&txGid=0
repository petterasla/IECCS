This paper describes the basic formulation of MERGE-ETL, the solving techniques used for this model and some first numerical results in the context of policies designed to mitigate global climate changes.","Endogenous technological change; Global climate change mitigation policies; MERGE",,,,,,,"Barreto, L., Kypreos, S., A post-Kyoto analysis with the ERIS model prototype (2000) Int.
