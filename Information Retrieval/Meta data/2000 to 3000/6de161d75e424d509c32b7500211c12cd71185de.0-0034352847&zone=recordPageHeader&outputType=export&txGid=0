The simulated AO trends are strongly dependent on the model and on the initial conditions of the simulations. The simulated winter temperature increase averaged over the Northern hemisphere is very similar in both models. However, the effect of the different AO trends on temperature causes clear differences in the predicted regional warming, which are reduced if the effects of the AO is linearly discounted. The uncertainty in the predictions of circulation changes has impacts on the estimation of regional temperature changes.",,"Arctic Oscillation; global warming; prediction; Computer simulation; Flow patterns; Geographical regions; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Probability; Arctic oscillation; Atmospheric circulation patterns; Global warming",,,,,,"Fyfe, J.C., Boer, G.J., Flato, G.M., The Arctic and Antarctic Oscillations and their projected changes under global warming (1999) Geophys.
