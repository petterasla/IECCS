Until recently, the efficacy of biomass-derived energy has focused primarily on biogeochemical consequences. Here we show that the biogeophysical effects that result from hypothetical conversion of annual to perennial bioenergy crops across the central United States impart a significant local to regional cooling with considerable implications for the reservoir of stored soil water. This cooling effect is related mainly to local increases in transpiration, but also to higher albedo. The reduction in radiative forcing from albedo alone is equivalent to a carbon emissions reduction of 78 t C ha-1, which is six times larger than the annual biogeochemical effects that arise from offsetting fossil fuel use. Thus, in the near-term, the biogeophysical effects are an important aspect of climate impacts of biofuels, even at the global scale. Locally, the simulated cooling is sufficiently large to partially offset projected warming due to increasing greenhouse gases over the next few decades. These results demonstrate that a thorough evaluation of costs and benefits of bioenergy-related land-use change must include potential impacts on the surface energy and water balance to comprehensively address important concerns for local, regional, and global climate change.","Agriculture; CO2; Landscape modification; Regional climate modeling","biofuel; fossil fuel; soil water; albedo; article; bioenergy; biogeochemical cycle; biomass energy; climate change; cooling; crop; evapotranspiration; greenhouse effect; perennial plant; priority journal; radiative forcing; rural area; sweating; United States; Biofuels; Climate; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Time Factors; United States",,"Biofuels",,,,"Sustainable Bioenergy: A Framework for Decision Makers, , http://esa.un.org/un-energy/pdf/susdev.Biofuels.FAO.pdf, (United Nations, Geneva), Available at; Fargione, J., Hill, J., Tilman, D., Polasky, S., Hawthorne, P., Land clearing and the biofuel carbon debt (2008) Science, 319 (5867), pp. 1235-1238. , DOI 10.1126/science.1152747; Martindale, W., Trewavas, A., Fuelling the 9 billion (2008) Nature Biotechnol, 26, pp. 1068-1070; Searchinger, T., Heimlich, R., Houghton, R.A., Dong, F., Elobeid, A., Fabiosa, J., Tokgoz, S., Yu, T.-H., Use of U.S. croplands for biofuels increases greenhouse gases through emissions from land-use change (2008) Science, 319 (5867), pp. 1238-1240. , DOI 10.1126/science.1151861; Hill, J., Nelson, E., Tilman, D., Polasky, S., Tiffany, D., Environmental, economic, and energetic costs and benefits of biodiesel and ethanol biofuels (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 103 (30), pp. 11206-11210. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.0604600103; Hill, J., Climate change and health costs of air emissions from biofuels and gasoline (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 106, pp. 2077-2082; Tilman, D., Hill, J., Lehman, C., Carbon-negative biofuels from low-input high-diversity grassland biomass (2006) Science, 314 (5805), pp. 1598-1600. , DOI 10.1126/science.1133306; Tilman, D., Beneficial biofuels - The food, energy, and environment trilemma (2009) Science, 325, pp. 270-271; Pielke Sr., R.A., Land use and climate change (2005) Science, 310, pp. 1625-1626; Foley, J.A., Global consequences of land-use (2005) Science, 309, pp. 570-574; Feddema, J.J., Oleson, K.W., Bonan, G.B., Mearns, L.O., Buja, L.E., Meehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Atmospheric science: The importance of land-cover change in simulating future climates (2005) Science, 310 (5754), pp. 1674-1678. , DOI 10.1126/science.1118160; Pielke Sr., R.A., An overview of regional land-use and land-cover impacts on rainfall (2007) Tellus B, 59, pp. 587-601; Adler, P.R., Del, G.S.J., Parton, W.J., Life-cycle assessment of net greenhouse-gas flux for bioenergy cropping systems (2007) Ecological Applications, 17 (3), pp. 675-691. , http://www.esajournals.org/pdfserv/i1051-0761-017-03-0675.pdf, DOI 10.1890/05-2018; Davis, S.C., Anderson-Teixera, K.J., DeLucia, E.H., Life-cycle analysis and the ecology of biofuels (2009) Trends Plant Sci, 14, pp. 140-146; (2006), http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/publications/2006/UCD-ITS-RR-06-08.pdf, (University of California, David, CA), Available atSkamarock, W.C., (2008) A Description of the Advanced Research WRF Version 3, , (National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO); Dohleman, F.G., Long, S.P., More productive than maize in the Midwest: How does Miscanthus do it?
