A reduction in the GHG emissions in the entire life cycle stages of a product was chosen as the global warming performance of the product. The external cost which converts the external effect of global warming into a monetary value was chosen as the global warming performance indicator in order to measure the performance of the GHG reduction of the product. The life cycle cost (LCC) of the product was chosen as the economic performance indicator to measure the performance of the life cycle cost reduction of the product. The assessment method based on the two performance indicators was applied to the liquid crystal display (LCD) panel for a case study. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
