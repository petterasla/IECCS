Facility operators may be familiar with pumping system equipment controllability, reliability, and availability, but only marginally aware of system efficiency. The general methodologies employed and case study examples of the prescreening and software application are described.",,"Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Energy savings; Screening pumping systems; Pumps",,,,,,"(1994) Centrifugal Pump Design and Application, , ANSI/HI 1.3; (1994) Efficiency Prediction Method for Centrifugal Pumps; (1989) IEEE Master Test Guide for Electrical Measurements in Power Circuits, , ANSI/IEEE 120; http:Hwww.motor.doe.gov/mmplus/default.htm, MotorMaster+ software program(1993) Full-Load Efficiencies of Energy Efficient Motors, (PART 12). , NEMA MG 1, Section II, Table 12-10; (1996) Assessment of Methods for Estimating Motor Efficiency and Load Under Field Conditions, , ORNL/TM-13165, January; (1998) United States Industrial Motor-Driven Systems Market Assessment: Charting a Roadmap to Energy Savings for Industry, International Workshop on Industrial Energy Efficiency Policies: Understanding Success and Failure, , June; (1998) United States Industrial Motor Systems Market Opportunities Assessment, , December","Casada, Don; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, United States",,,"Fairmont Press Inc, Lilburn, GA, United States",,,,,01998595,,EENGD,,"English","Energy Eng",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033747427
