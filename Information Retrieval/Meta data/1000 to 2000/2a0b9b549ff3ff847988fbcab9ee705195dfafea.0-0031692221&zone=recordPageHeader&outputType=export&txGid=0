N2L 3G1, Canada","Tourism and recreation are important economic activities which are major agents of change globally and, more specifically, in wetland areas. There is a regular round of activities associated with the seasons and anything which influences operating seasons is likely to have substantial consequent, for tourism businesses. Atmospheric conditions influence both whether of not people will participate as well as the quality of the experience. In marine coasts, wetland recreations may be threatened by rising sea levels but recreation in inland water bodies may be affected more by deficiencies rather than superabundance of water. Marinas and recreational boating are harmed by extremes of both high and low water, particularly the latter which is the most likely situation under global climate change. Two main groups can be considered with respect to the potential to adapt to climate change. These are the participants themselves and the businesses which cater to them. It is argued that the former are likely to be much more adaptable than the latter.","Marinas; Natural areas; Seasonality; Tourism","climate change; recreational activity; tourism; wetland",,,,,,"Armentano, T.V., Park, R.A., Cloonan, C.L., Impacts on coastal wetlands throughout the United States (1988) Greenhouse Effect, Sea Level Rise and Coastal Wetlands, pp. 87-149. , Titus, J.G.
