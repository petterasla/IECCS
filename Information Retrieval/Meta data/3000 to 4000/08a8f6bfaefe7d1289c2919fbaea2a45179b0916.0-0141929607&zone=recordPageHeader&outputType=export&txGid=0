The analysis was based on real industrial operations in Japan, USA and UK. It showed that production required limestone, water and transition metal catalysts, in addition to the basic raw materials, and that the energy required to provide these raw materials in a form that can be used at the plants and to process them through intermediates into HFC-134a is the equivalent of 4.52 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of product. Environmental releases associated with HFC-134a included waste salt brine (to the sea), mine tailings (mainly ""country"" rock landfilled at the mine) and small quantities of calcium sulphate and spent catalyst (both sent to landfill). In addition, greenhouse gases amounting to the equivalent of 2.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of product were emitted to the atmosphere from the plants studied, an effect very much smaller than that estimated in previous studies mainly because the real release rates from current processes are very much less than those assumed in prior work. The global warming potential2 The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of a material is defined as the integrated radiative forcing over 100 years following an assumed release of 1kg divided by the integrated radiative forcing over the same period from release of 1 kg of carbon dioxide. Radiative forcing is the specific increase in infrared absorption in Wm-2 ppb-1 (Watts per square metre at the Earth's surface per part per billion concentration of the material). All effects beyond 100 years are disregarded; thus Global Warming Potential captures all of the effect of an HFC but less than 40% of the total effect from CO2. of HFC-134a is 1300, meaning that, during the first 100 years following the release of one tonne, the effect on climate change is equivalent to 1300 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Consequently, the 6.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, emitted during production in the form of energy required and other greenhouse gases, is of relatively little importance and the key requirement to reduce environmental impact is containment during use. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. and IIR.
