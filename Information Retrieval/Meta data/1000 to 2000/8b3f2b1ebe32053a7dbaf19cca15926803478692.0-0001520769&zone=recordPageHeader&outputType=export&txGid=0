Photosynthetic conversion of CO2 into Chlorella biomass was investigated in a photobioreactor, which we termed a cone-shaped helical tubular photobioreactor. The laboratory scale photobioreactor (0.48 m high × 0.57 m top diameter) was set up with a 0.255 m2 installation area. The photostage was made from transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing (1.6 cm internal diameter with 2 cm wall thickness and 27 m in length). The inner surface of the cone-shaped photostage (0.50 m2) was illuminated with a metal halide lamp, the energy input into the photostage[photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) ] was 2127 KJ day-1 (12 h day /12 h night) . The maximum daily photosynthetic efficiency was 5.67% (PAR) under an air-lift operation at a flow rate of 0.3 litre min-1 10 % CO2 enriched air. Maximum increase of Chlorella biomass was 21.5 g dry biomass m-2 (installation area) day-1 or 0.68 g dry biomass litre medium-1 day-1. Also, a helical tubular photobioreactor for outdoor culture was constructed with a 1.1 m2 installation area (1.2 m top diameter) and photosynthetic productivity was investigated in July, 1996. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Chlorella; CO2; CO2 fixation; Global warming; Microalgae; Photobioreactor; Photosynthesis",,,,,,,"Hall, D.O., Scurlock, J.M.O., Biomass production and data (1993) Photosynthesis and Production in a Changing Environment, pp. 425-444. , D.O.
