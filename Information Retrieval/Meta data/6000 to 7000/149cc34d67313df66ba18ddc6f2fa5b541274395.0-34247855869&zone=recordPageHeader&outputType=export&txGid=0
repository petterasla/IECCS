Responses from 286 participants were analyzed and compared to results obtained in a similar survey conducted in 1993. Respondents tended to rank highest those threats associated with human population growth, coastal development, and overfishing. While coral bleaching was ranked much more highly than in the 1993 survey, about two-thirds of the respondents felt that direct human impacts were worse threats than those associated with global climate change. © 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.",,"anthropogenic effect; biological survey; climate change; coastal development; coral bleaching; coral reef; ecosystem management; environmental disturbance; environmental impact assessment; global climate; overfishing; perception; population growth; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Bryant, D., Burke, L., McManus, J., Spalding, M., Reefs at Risk (1998) A Map-Based Indicator of Threats to the World's Coral Reefs, , World Resources Institute. 56 p; Buddemeier, R.W., Kleypas, J.A., Aronson, R.B., Coral Reefs and Global Climate Change.
