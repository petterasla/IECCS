Elevated CO2 decreased the palatability of winter-dormant silver and paper birch stems to both hares and rabbits, respectively. But the effect on hares was only apparent at intermediate levels of N fertilization. Elevated T had no effect on palatability. The effects of elevated CO2, N, and T on levels of silver birch bark phenolics and terpenoids were dominated by two-way interactions between N and CO2, and N and T. Generally, however, N amendments elicited a parabolic response in carbon partitioning to most biosynthetic classes of silver birch phenolics (i.e. highest concentrations occurring at intermediate N). CO2 elevation was most enhancing at highest levels of N. On the other hand, T increases, more often than not, elicited reductions in phenolics, but especially so at the highest N level. In the case of B. papyrifera, elevated CO2 increased carbon partitioning to Folin-Denis stem and branch phenolics and condensed tannins. Early-season defoliation, on the other hand, had no effect on phenolics and tannins but lowered both N and energy levels of branches. Elevated CO2 substantially ameliorated the negative effects of severe defoliation on tree growth. These results support the hypothesis that continuing anthropogenic alterations of the atmosphere may trigger significant changes in plant phenotypic resistance to mammalian herbivores owing to an increasing net carbon balance between the highly vagile supply and demand capacities of plant carbon sources and sinks. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Global climate change; Growth-differentiation balance; Phenolics; Source-sink balance; Tannins","carbon dioxide; climate change; defoliation; herbivory; phenol; tannin; Betula; Betula papyrifera; Betula pendula; Lagomorpha; Lepus; Lepus timidus; Mammalia; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Sylvilagus; Sylvilagus floridanus",,,,,,"Anttonen, S., Piispanen, R., Ovaska, J., Effects of defoliation on growth, biomass allocation, and wood properties of Betula pendula clones grown at different nutrient levels (2002) Canadian Journal of Forestry Research, 32, pp. 498-508; Arnold, T.M., Schultz, J.C., Induced sink strength as prerequisite for induced tannin biosynthesis in developing leaves of Populus (2002) Oecologia, 130, pp. 585-593; Bezemer, T.M., Jones, T.H., Plant-insect herbivore interactions in elevated atmospheric CO2: Quantitative analyses and guild effects (1998) Oikos, 82, pp. 212-222; Chapin, F.S., Zavaleta, E.S., Eviner, V.T., Consequences of changing biodiversity (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 234-242; Coviella, C.E., Trumble, J.T., Effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on insect-plant interactions (1999) Conservation Biology, 13, pp. 700-712; Curtis, P.S., Wang, X., A meta-analysis of elevated CO2 effects on woody plant mass, form, and physiology (1998) Oecologia, 113, pp. 299-313; Dickson, R.E., Lewin, K.F., Isebrands, J.G., (2000) Forest Atmosphere Carbon Transfer and Storage (FACTS-II) The Aspen Free-air CO2 and O3 Enrichment (FACE) Project: An Overview, , USDA General Technical Report NC-214, North Central Res.
