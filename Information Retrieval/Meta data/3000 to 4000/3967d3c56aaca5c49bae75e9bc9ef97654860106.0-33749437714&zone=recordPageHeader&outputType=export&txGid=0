Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) can be used for treatment of wet organic waste. The technology has been under development for over 20 years but has not yet been fully commercialized. SCWO allows for complete oxidation of all organics in sewage sludge and almost complete recovery of the inherent energy, essentially without harmful emissions. In this paper, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of sewage sludge SCWO (Aqua-Critox) is presented and the results are compared with LCA results for other sludge handling options: agricultural use, co-incineration with municipal solid waste, incineration with subsequent phosphorus extraction (Bio-Con) and sludge fractionation with phosphorus recovery (Cambi-KREPRO). For SCWO, beneficial utilization of the heat of reaction is of crucial importance for the outcome. The electricity consumed by pumping and the nitrous oxide produced are other important parameters. The best sludge handling option from an environmental point of view depends on what aspect is considered more important in the impact assessment. Regarding global warming, the energy recovery methods perform better than agricultural use. © ISWA 2005.","(SCWO); Aqua-Critox; Cycle assessment; District heating; Eco-efficiency; Life; Sewage sludge; Supercritical water oxidation; Wmr 774-3","Environmental impact; Sewage sludge; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; Eco-efficiency; Environmental assessment; Sewage sludge handling; Supercritical water oxidation; Wet organic waste; Sewage treatment; nitrous oxide; phosphorus; water; Environmental impact; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; environmental impact assessment; fractionation; life cycle analysis; oxidation; sewage; sludge; supercritical flow; agricultural procedures; article; commercial phenomena; controlled study; electricity; energy recovery; environmental impact assessment; fractionation; greenhouse effect; incineration; intermethod comparison; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; organic waste; oxidation; priority journal; resource management; sludge treatment; supercritical fluid; sustainable development; technology; waste component removal; waste management; waste water management",,"nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Baumann, H., Rydberg, T., Life Cycle Assessment: A comparison of three methods for impact analysis and evaluation (1994) Journal of Cleaner Production, 2, pp. 13-20; Brännström-Norberg, B.-M., Dethlefsen, U., Johansson, R., Setterwall, C., Tunbrant, S., Life-Cycle Assessment for Vattenfall's Electricity Generation (1996), Summary Report.
