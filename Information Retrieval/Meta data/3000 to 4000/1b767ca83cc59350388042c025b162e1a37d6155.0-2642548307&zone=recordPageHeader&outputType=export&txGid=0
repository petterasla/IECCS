The frequency and severity of drought in the tropics may increase through stronger El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes, global warming, and rainfall inhibition by land use change. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of drought in moist tropical forests, and the complex relationships between patterns of drought and forest fire regimes, tree mortality, and productivity. We present a simple geographic information system soil water balance model, called RisQue (Risco de Queimada - Fire Risk) for the Amazon basin that we use to conduct an analysis of these patterns for 1996-2001. RisQue features a map of maximum plant-available soil water (PAWmax) developed using 1565 soil texture profiles and empirical relationships between soil texture and critical soil water parameters. PAW is depleted by monthly evapotranspiration (ET) fields estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation and satellite-derived radiation inputs and recharged by monthly rain fields estimated from 266 meteorological stations. Modeled PAW to 10 m depth (PAW 10m) was similar to field measurements made in two Amazon forests. During the severe drought of 2001, PAW10m fell to below 25% of PAWmax in 31% of the region's forests and fell below 50% PAWmax in half of the forests. Field measurements and experimental forest fires indicate that soil moisture depletion below 25% PAWmax corresponds to a reduction in leaf area index of approximately 25%, increasing forest flammability. Hence, approximately one-third of Amazon forests became susceptible to fire during the 2001 ENSO period. Field measurements also suggest that the ENSO drought of 2001 reduced carbon storage by approximately 0.2 Pg relative to years without severe soil moisture deficits. RisQue is sensitive to spin-up time, rooting depth, and errors in ET estimates. Improvements in our ability to accurately model soil moisture content of Amazon forests will depend upon better understanding of forest rooting depths, which can extend to beyond 15m. RisQue provides a tool for early detection of forest fire risk. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Evapotranspiration; Fire; Hydrology; NPP; Rainforest; Soil moisture; Tropical; Water balance","drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forest fire; growth rate; mortality; soil water; Amazon Basin; South America",,,,,,"Alencar, A., Solórzano, L., Nepstad, D., Modeling forest understory fire in an eastern Amazon landscape Ecological Applications, , in press; Barlow, J., Lagan, B.D., Haugaasen, T., Large tree mortality and the decline of forest biomass following Amazonian wildfires (2003) Ecology Letters, 6, pp. 6-8; Barreto, P., Amaral, P., Vidal, E., Costs and benefits of forest management for timber production in eastern Amazonia (1998) Forest Ecology and Management, 108, pp. 9-26; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., The storage and production of organic matter in tropical forests and their role in the global carbon cycle (1982) Biotropica, 14, pp. 161-187; Canadell, J., Jackson, R.B., Ehleringer, J.R., Maximum rooting depth of vegetation types at the global scale (1996) Oecologia, 108, pp. 583-595; Ceballos, J.C., Moura, G.B.A., Solar radiation assessment using Meteosat 4-VIS imagery (1997) Solar Energy, 60, pp. 209-219; Cochrane, M.A., Alencar, A., Schulze, M.D., Positive feedbacks in the fire dynamic of closed canopy tropical forests (1999) Science, 284, pp. 1832-1835; Cochrane, M.A., Schulze, M.D., Forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon (1998) Conservation Biology, 12, pp. 948-950; Costa, M.H., Foley, J.A., Combined effects of deforestation and doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the climate of Amazonia (2000) Journal of Climate, 13, pp. 18-34; Curran, L.M., Caniago, I., Paoli, G.D., Impact of El Niño and logging on canopy tree recruitment in Borneo (1999) Science, 286, pp. 2184-2188; Dawson, T.E., Hydraulic lift and water use by plants: Implications for water balance, performance and plant-plant interactions (1993) Oecologia, 95, pp. 565-574; Grace, J., Lloyd, J., McIntyre, J., Carbon dioxide uptake by an undisturbed tropical rain forest in southwest Amazonia, 1992-1993 (1995) Science, 270, pp. 778-780; Hodnett, M.G., Pimental da Silva, L., da Rocha, H.R., Seasonal soil water storage changes beneath central Amazonia rainforest and pasture (1995) Journal of Hydrology, 170, pp. 233-254; Holdsworth, A.R., Uhl, C., Fire in Amazonian selectively logged rain forest and the potential for fire reduction (1997) Ecological Applications, 7, pp. 713-725; Houghton, R.A., The annual net flux of carbon to the atmosphere from changes in land use 1850-1990 (1999) Tellus, 51 B, pp. 298-313; Houghton, R.A., Lawrence, K.T., Hackler, J.L., The spatial distribution of forest biomass in the Brazilian Amazon: A comparison of estimates (2002) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 731-746; Houghton, R.A., Skole, D.L., Nobre, C.A., Annual fluxes of carbon from deforestation and regrowth in the Brazilian Amazon (2000) Nature, 403, pp. 301-304; Jackson, R.B., Schenk, H.J., Jobbagy, E.G., Belowground consequences of vegetation change and their treatment in models (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 470-483; Jipp, P., Nepstad, D.C., Cassel, K., Deep soil moisture storage and transpiration in forests and pastures of seasonally-dry Amazonia (1998) Climatic Change, 39, pp. 395-412; Kauffman, J.B., Uhl, C., Cummings, D.L., Fire in the Venezuelan Amazon 1: Fuel biomass and fire chemistry in the evergreen rainforest of Venezuela (1988) Oikos, 53, pp. 167-175; Lean, J., Bunton, C.B., Nobre, C.A., The simulated impact of Amazonian deforestation on climate using measured ABRACOS vegetation characteristics (1996) Amazonian Deforestation and Climate, pp. 549-576. , (eds Gash JHC, Nobre CA, Roberts JM, Victoria RL), John Wiley and Sons, New York; Malhi, Y., Nobre, A.D., Grace, J., Carbon dioxide transfer over a central Amazonian rain forest (1998) Journal of Geophysical Research, 103, pp. 31593-31612; Mendoça, M., Diaz, M., Nepstad, D., The economic cost of the use of fire in the Amazon (2004) Ecological Economics, , in press; Monteith, J.L., Evaporation and environment (1965) Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology, 19, pp. 205-234; Nepstad, D.C., Carvalho, G.O., Barros, A.C., Road paving, fire regime feedbacks, and the future of Amazon forests (2001) Forest Ecology and Management, 154, pp. 395-407; Nepstad, D.C., Carvalbo, C.J.Rd., Davidson, E.A., The role of deep roots in the hydrological and carbon cycles of Amazonian forests and pastures (1994) Nature, 372, pp. 666-669; Nepstad, D.C., Jipp, P., Moutinho, P.R.dS., Forest recovery following pasture abandonment in Amazonia: Canopy seasonality, fire resistance and ants (1995) Evaluating and Monitoring the Health of Large-Scale Ecosystems, pp. 333-349. , (ed.
