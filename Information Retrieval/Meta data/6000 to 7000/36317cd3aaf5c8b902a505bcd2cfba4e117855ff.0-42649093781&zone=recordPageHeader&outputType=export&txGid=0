The greater persistence may affect surface climatic anomalies, particularly the frequency and severity of heat and cold waves associated with severe impacts on society and environment. In this paper, relationships between the persistence of circulation types over Europe and extreme surface air temperature anomalies are studied over the 20th century using the Hess-Brezowsky catalogue of large-scale circulation patterns and long-term temperature series at stations covering most of the European continent. Types significantly conducive to heat and cold waves are identified, and temperature anomalies are linked to their persistence. It is shown that more persistent circulation enhances the severity of temperature extremes over the whole area, which is slightly more important for warm than cold temperature anomalies. The changes in both frequencies and residence times of circulation patterns have been supporting sharply rising trends in warm temperature extremes observed over Europe in recent decades, and the circulation changes may also contributed to the fact that trends in cold temperature extremes have been less pronounced or absent in the same period. The findings also emphasize the need for taking into account the persistence of circulation types together with their frequencies when evaluating links between the atmospheric circulation and the surface climate. In global warming context, the effects of the future climate change on the occurrence and severity of temperature extremes may be exacerbated by a more persistent circulation related to a decreased cyclone activity over mid-latitudes and a northward shift of storm tracks. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
