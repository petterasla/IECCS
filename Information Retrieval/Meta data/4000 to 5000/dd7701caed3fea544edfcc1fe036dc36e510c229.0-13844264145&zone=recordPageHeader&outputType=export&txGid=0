Nine different types of power generation systems were examined: coal-fired, oil-fired, LNG-fired, LNG-combined cycle, nuclear, hydropower, geothermal, wind power and solar-photovoltaic (PV). Life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission per kW h of electricity generated was estimated for the systems using a combined method of process analysis and input-output analysis. First, average power generation systems reflecting the current status in Japan were examined as base cases. Second, the impacts of emerging and future nuclear, wind power and PV technologies were analyzed. Finally, uncertainties associated with some assumptions were examined to help clarify interpretation of the results. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Combined cycle power plants; Electric power generation; Electricity; Geothermal power plants; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Hydroelectric power; Liquefied natural gas; Nuclear power plants; Solar power generation; Wind power; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Japan; Life cycle analysis (LCA); LNG-combined cycle power generation systems; Gas emissions; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; power generation; power plant; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; World",,,,,,"Van De Vate, J.F., Comparison of energy sources in terms of their full energy chain emission factors of greenhouse gases (1997) Energy Policy, 25 (1), pp. 1-6; Uchiyama, Y., Yamamoto, H., (1992) Greenhouse Effect Analysis of Power Generation Plants, Report No. Y91006, Y91006. , Tokyo, Japan: Central Research Institute Electric Power Industry [in Japanese]; Yoshioka, K., Uchiyama, Y., Suga, M., Hondo, H., An application of input-output approach in environmental analysis: Estimating CO2 emission from fossil-fired and nuclear power generation (1994) Innov I-O Tech, 5 (1), pp. 31-56. , [in Japanese]; Waku, H., Tamura, I., Inque, M., Akai, M., Life cycle analysis of fossil power plant with CO2 recovery and sequestering system (1995) Energy Convers Manage, 36 (6-9), pp. 877-880; Uchiyama, Y., Life cycle analysis of electricity generation and supply systems (1996) Proceedings of a Symposium on Electricity, Health and the Environment: Comparative Assessment in Support of Decision Making, pp. 279-291. , Vienna, Austria; Izuno, N., Akutsu, N., Natori, K., Life cycle CO2 analysis of electric power in electric industry (1998) Proceedings of the Third International Conference on EcoBalance, pp. 343-347. , Tsukuba, Japan; Nomura, N., Inaba, A., Tonooka, Y., Akai, M., Life-cycle emission of oxide gases from power-generation systems (2001) Appl Energy, 68, pp. 215-227; Proofs, J.L.R., Gay, P.W., Speck, S., Schroder, T., The lifeteime pollution implications of various types of electricity generation (1996) Energy Policy, 24 (3), pp. 229-237; Hondo, H., Moriizumi, Y., Uchiyama, Y., (2000) Evaluation of Power Generation Technologies Based on Life Cycle CO2 Emissions, , report no.
