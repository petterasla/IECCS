Since automobiles exert an important effect on global warming due to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2), measures for promoting ""EcoDrive"" and ""safe driving"" are expected to gain more importance in the future. This paper is intended to introduce the fuel consumption and drive safety improvement effects of EcoDrive, which are further explained by surveys on the introduction of the EcoDrive diagnosis system. It also serves to introduce the EcoDrive diagnosis system ""DriveManager"".","DriveManager; EcoDrive; ITS; Safe driving","EcoDrive; Safe driving; Environmental impact; Fuel consumption; Program diagnostics; Safety factor; Automobile simulators",,,,,,,"Igarashi, T.; 2nd Systems Dept., 1st Government Solutions Division, NEC Soft Ltd.Japan",,,,,,,,18805884,,,,"English","NEC Tech.
