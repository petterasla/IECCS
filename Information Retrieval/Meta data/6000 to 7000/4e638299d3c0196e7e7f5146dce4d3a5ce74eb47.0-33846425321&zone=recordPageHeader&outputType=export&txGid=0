Temporal and spatial patterns of the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of the PDSI reveals a fairly linear trend resulting from trends in precipitation and surface temperature, which is similar to the linear PDSI trend during 1951-2000 calculated using all monthly data. The EOF analysis also reveals that the leading mode correlates significantly with ENSO events in time and space. The ENSO EOF shows that during the typical warm phase of ENSO, surface conditions are drier in most regions of China, especially North China, but wetter than normal in the southern regions of Changjiang River, and Northwest China. During the typical cold phase of ENSO, these anomalies reverse sign. From 1951 to 2000, there are large multi-year to decadal variations in droughts and wet spells over China, which are all closely related to strong El Niño events. In other words, when one strong El Niño event happens, there is a possible big variability in droughts and wet spells over China on the multi-year or decadal scale. Studies also suggest that during the last 2-3 decades climate changes over China, especially North China's drying and northwest China's wetting, are closely related to the shift in ENSO towards warmer events and global warming since the late 1970s. The instability of the relationship is also studied. It is revealed that there is a good correlation between ENSO and Chinese variations in droughts and wet spells in the 3-8-year band, but the correlation between ENSO and Chinese variations in droughts and wet spells is instable. Studies suggest that there are decadal changes in the correlation: the wavelet coherency between ENSO and Chinese variations in droughts and wet spells is high during 1951-1962 and 1976-1991, but low during 1963-1975 and 1992-2000. © Science in China Press 2007.","Droughts and wet Spells; ENSO; Instability; PDSI; Variations","Climate change; Drought; Statistical methods; Empirical orthogonal function; Wet spells; Meteorology; annual variation; decadal variation; drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; empirical analysis; precipitation (climatology); temperature; wet season; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Yangtze Basin",,,,,,"Wang, S.W., Diagnostic studies on the climate change and variability for the period of 1880-1990 (1994) Acta Meteorol Sin, 52 (3), pp. 263-272. , (in Chinese); Chen, L.X., Shao, Y.N., Zhang, Q.F., The elementary analysis of Chinese climate change during the last forty years (1991) J Appl Meteorol, 2 (2), pp. 164-173. , (in Chinese); Chen, L.X., Zhou, X.J., Li, W.L., Climate change and its mechanism during the last eighty years (2004) Acta Meteorol Sin, 62 (5), pp. 634-646. , (in Chinese); Wang, S.W., Studies on climatic change in China during the last one hundred years (1998) Sci Found of China, 3, pp. 167-170. , (in Chinese); Zhai, P.M., Chao, Q.C., Zou, X.K., Progress in China's climate change study in the 20th century (2004) J Geogr Sci, 14 (SUPPL.), pp. 3-11; Trenberth, K.E., Overpeck, J.T.S., Exploring drought and its implications for The future (2004) Eos, 85, p. 27; Wilhite, D.A., Drought as a natural hazard: Concepts and definitions (2000) Droughts: A Global Assessment, pp. 3-18. , In: Wilhite D A, ed.
