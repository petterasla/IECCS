Here we report 20 brachiopod species in 18 genera from the uppermost Shaiwa Group. This brachiopod fauna is latest Changhsingian in age and dominated by productides. The palaeoecologic and taphonomic analysis reveals that the brachiopod fauna is preserved in situ. The attachment modes and substratum preference demonstrate that the Shaiwa brachiopod fauna comprises admixed elements of deep-water and shallow-water assemblages. The presence of the shallow-water brachiopods in the Shaiwa faunas indicates the involuntary settlement of shallow-water brachiopods. The stressed ecologic pressure, triggered by warming surface waters, restricted ecospace and short food sources, may have forced some shallow-water elements to move to hospitable deep-water settings and others to modify their habiting behaviours and exploit new ecospace in deep-water environments. We infer that the end-Permian global warming and subsequent transgression event may have accounted for the stressed environmental pressure in the shallow-water communities prior to the end-Permian mass extinction. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Brachiopods; Ecologic admixture; Ecologic pressure; End-Permian global warming; Shaiwa fauna","brachiopod; deep water; global warming; paleoecology; Permian; taphonomy; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Guizhou; Bivalvia; Brachiopoda; Foraminifera; Here; Radiolaria (protozoans)",,,,,,"Brunton, C.H.C., The shell structure of chonetacean brachiopods and their ancestors (1972) Bulletin of British Museum (Natural History) Geology, 21, pp. 1-26; Brunton, C.H.C., Growth and shell shape in productacean brachiopods (1984) Bulletin of British Museum (Natural History) Geology, 38, pp. 273-281; Brunton, C.H.C., The palaeoecology of brachiopods, and other faunas, of Lower Carboniferous (Asbian) limestones in West Fermanagh (1987) Irish Journal of Earth Sciences, 8, pp. 97-112; Chen, Z.Q., Lower Permian reef-dwelling brachiopod faunas from the northern Tarim Basin, NW China (2004) Palaeontographica Abteilung A, 272, pp. 1-96; Chen, Z.Q., Campi, M.J., Shi, G.R., Kaiho, K., Post-extinction brachiopod faunas from the Late Permian Wuchiapingian coal series of South China (2005) Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 50, pp. 343-363; Chen, Z.Q., Jin, Y.G., Shi, G.R., Permian transgression-regression sequences and sea-level changes of South China (1998) Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria, 110, pp. 345-367; Chen, Z.Q., Kaiho, K., George, A.D., Survival strategies of brachiopod faunas from the end-Permian mass extinction (2005) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology, 224, pp. 232-269; Chen, Z.Q., Kaiho, K., George, A.D., Early Triassic recovery of brachiopod faunas from the end-Permian mass extinction: A global review (2005) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology, 224, pp. 270-290; Chen, Z.Q., Kaiho, K., George, A.D., Tong, J.N., Survival brachiopod faunas of the end-Permian mass extinction from northern Italy and south China (2006) Geological Magazine, , (in press); Chen, Z.Q., Liao, Z.T., Intense biotic predatory/parasitic interactions during the Permian-Triassic transition: A link between predation/parasitism and mass extinction (2005) Abstracts, The Fifth International Brachiopod Congress, , Copenhagen.
