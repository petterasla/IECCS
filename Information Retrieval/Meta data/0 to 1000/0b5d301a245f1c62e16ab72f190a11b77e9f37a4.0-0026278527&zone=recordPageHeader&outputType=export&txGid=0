Negative effects limiting population growth will probably set in during the latter stages of the 3.0° and 4.5°C CO2 doubling scenarios. Of chief importance to population restructuring is the timing of temperature increases during specific periods of the year and whether these temperature increases co-occur with fragile, temperature-sensitive early life stages. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide; fish; global warming; lake water; water temperature; whitefish; Germany, Lake Constance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026278527
