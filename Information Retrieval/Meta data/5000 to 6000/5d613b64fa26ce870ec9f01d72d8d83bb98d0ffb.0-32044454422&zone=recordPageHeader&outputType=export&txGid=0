In this study, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and organic carbon density were estimated based on a soil survey of a small landscape in Dongguan, South China, with spatial heterogeneity of SOC distribution and the impacts of land-use patterns on soil organic carbon content assessed. Field sampling was carried out based on a 150 m x 150 m grid system overlaid on the topographic map of the study area and samples were collected in three 20-cm layers to a depth of 60 cm. Spatial variability in the distribution of SOC was assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results showed that SOC in the topsoil layer (0-20 cm) was not much higher or even lower in some sites than the underlying layers, and except for the two sites covered with natural woodland, it did not exhibit a pronounced vertical gradient. The difference in both horizontal and vertical distribution of SOC was not statistically significant. However, in the topsoil layer among land-use/land-cover patterns, significant differences (P ≤ 0.05) in SOC distribution existed, indicating that management practices had great impact on SOC content. SOC storage in the study area to a depth of 20, 40, and 60 cm was estimated as 2.13 × 106 kg, 3.46 × 10 6 kg, and 4.61 × 106 kg, respectively. © 2006 Soil Science Society of China Published by Elsevier Limited and Science Press.","Land-use pattern; Organic carbon content; Organic carbon density; Spatial variability","land use change; organic carbon; spatial variation; vegetation cover; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,,,,,"Chen, Q.Q., Shen, C.D., Sun, Y.M., Peng, S.L., Yi, W.X., Li, Z.A., Jiang, M.T., Mechanism of distribution of soil organic matter with depth due to evolution of soil profiles at the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve (2005) Acta Pedologica Sinica (in Chinese), 42 (1), pp. 1-8; Fang, J.Y., Chen, A.P., Dynamic forest biomass carbon pools in China and their significance (2001) Acta Botanica Sinica (in Chinese), 43 (9), pp. 967-973; Fang, J.Y., Liu, G.H., Xu, S.L., The carbon pool of the terrestrial ecosystems in China (1996) Monitoring and Relevant Process of Greenhouse Gas Concentration and Emission (in Chinese), pp. 109-128. , Wang, G.
