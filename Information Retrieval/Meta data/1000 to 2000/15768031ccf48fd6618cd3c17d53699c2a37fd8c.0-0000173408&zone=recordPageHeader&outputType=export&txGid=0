Commonly accepted models need to be modified to accurately estimate the impact from a single process gas. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), commonly used in CVD chamber cleans, create particular problems in the atmosphere. A variety of techniques can be used to manage the effluent stream. Recent work has focused on improving reaction efficiencies to reduce the quantity of PFCs.",,"Air pollution control; Chemical vapor deposition; Effluent treatment; Electronics industry; Fluorine compounds; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Perfluorinated compounds (PFC); Integrated circuit manufacture",,,,,,"Climate change (1990) The IPCC Scientific Assessment, pp. xxii. , Cambridge University Press; Maroulis, P., PFCs and the semiconductor industry: A closer look (1994) Semiconductor International, 17, pp. 107-110. , Nov; Ridgeway, R., Determination of perfluorinated carbons, nitrogen trifluoride and sulfur hexafluoride in process tool exhaust at a fully operational aemiconductor dabrication dacility (1994) Proc.
