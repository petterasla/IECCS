The study area was separated into a control and treatment block using a sheet-metal groundwater divide to a depth of 1 m. Temperatures were increased according to General Circulation Model (GCM) projections for Southern Ontario, Canada. We examined the response of the groundwater chironomid community during pre-manipulation, manipulation and recovery periods. We found that warming decreased the total abundance of chironomids whereas no significant change in taxonomic richness was apparent. Interestingly, taxon composition changed markedly during both the manipulation and the recovery period. Whereas Heterotrissocladius disappeared during the manipulation in the treatment block, other coldstenothermal taxa such as Micropsectra, Parametriocnemus and Heleniella remained unaffected. Conversely, Corynoneura, Polypedilum and Thienemannia gracilis disappeared but were not reported as coldstenothermal. The chironomid community composition in the system changed from a Heterotrissocladius, Brillia, and Tanytarsini-dominated community during the pre-manipulation towards one dominated by Parametriocnemus, Polypedilum, Orthocladius/Cricotopus and Corynoneura during the recovery. Although increased temperature had a strong effect, chironomid occurrence was also influenced by a number of other abiotic variables, such as dissolved oxygen, depth, ammonia concentration and TDS (Total dissolved solids). © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chironomids; Ecosystem-manipulation; Global warming; Groundwater; Species-environment relationships; Springbrook","Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Ecology; Ecosystems; Global warming; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Metal recovery; Oxygen; Sheet metal; Underground reservoirs; Water treatment; Ammonia concentrations; Chironomids; Community compositions; Ecosystem-manipulation; Freshwater ecosystems; Increased temperatures; Ontario , canada; Shallow ground waters; Species-environment relationships; Springbrook; Study areas; Taxonomic richness; Thermal regimes; Total dissolved solids; Chemicals removal (water treatment); abundance; community response; dissolved oxygen; fly; freshwater ecosystem; general circulation model; global warming; species richness; species-area relationship; temperature effect; thermal regime; Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Brillia; Chironomidae; Corynoneura; Heleniella; Heterotrissocladius; Micropsectra; Parametriocnemus; Polypedilum; Tanytarsini; Thienemannia gracilis",,,,,,"Adams, G.A., Wall, D.H., Biodiversity above and below the surface of soils and sediments: Linkages and implications for global change (2000) Bioscience, 50, pp. 1043-1048; Araújo, M.B., Pearson, R.G., Thuiller, W., Erhard, M., Validation of species-climate impact models under climate change (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 1504-1513; Baker, M.A., Dahm, C.N., Valett, H.M., (2000)Baulch, H.M., Schindler, D.W., Turner, M.A., Findlay, D.L., Paterson, M.J., Vinebrooke, R.D., Effects of warming on benthic communities in a boreal lake: Implications of climate change (2005) Limnology and Oceanography, 50, pp. 1377-1392; Brooks, S.J., Birks, H.J.B., Chironomid-inferred air temperatures from Late-glacial and Holocene sites in north-west Europe: Progress and problems (2001) Quaternary Science Reviews, 20, pp. 1723-1741; Burgmer, T., Hillebrand, H., Pfenninger, M., Effects of climate driven temperature changes on the diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates (2007) Oecologia, 151, pp. 93-103; Covich, A.P., Fritz, S.C., Lamb, P.J., Marzolf, R.D., Matthews, W.J., Poiani, K.A., Prepas, E.E., Winter, T.C., Potential effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems of the Great Plains of North America (1997) Hydrological Processes, 11, pp. 993-1021; Danks, H.V., Williams, D.D., Arthropods of springs, with particular reference to Canada: Synthesis and needs for research (1991) Memoirs of the Entomological Society of Canada, 155, pp. 203-217; Daufresne, M., Roger, M.C., Capra, H., Lamouroux, N., Long-term changes within the invertebrate and fish communities of the upper Rhône River: Effects of climatic factors (2003) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 124-140; Davis, A.J., Jenkinson, L.S., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Wood, S., Making mistakes when predicting shifts in species range in response to global warming (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 783-786; Franken, R.J.M., Storey, R.G., Williams, D.D., Biological, chemical and physical characteristics of downwelling and upwelling zones in the hyporheic zone of a north-temperate stream (2001) Hydrobiologia, 444, pp. 183-195; Freeze, R.A., Cherry, J.A., (1979), pp. 23-24. , Prentice-Hall, Inc New JerseyGathmann, F.O., Williams, D.D., Insect emergence in Canadian coldwater springs: Spatial and temporal patterns, and species-environment relationships (2006) International Journal of Limnology, 42, pp. 143-156; Hengeveld, H.G., Projections for Canada's climate future: A discussion of recent simulations with the canadian global climate model (2000) Climate Change Digest Special Edition (CCD 00-01), , Meteorological Service of Canada, Environment Canada, Downsview, Ontario; Hogg, I.D., Williams, D.D., Response of stream invertebrates to a global-warming thermal regime: An ecosystem-level manipulation (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 395-407; Hogg, I.D., Williams, D.D., Eadie, J.M., Butt, S.A., The consequences of global warming for stream invertebrates: A field simulation (1995) Journal of Thermal Biology, 20, pp. 199-206; Hubbs, C., Perspectives: Springs and spring runs as unique aquatic systems (1995) Copeia, 4, pp. 989-991; Hughes, L., Biological consequences of global warming: Is the signal already apparent?
