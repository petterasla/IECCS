Both are part of the IMAGE 2.0 model of global climate change. The models have been calibrated and tested with regional data from 1970-1990. The Agricultural Demand Model can approximate the observed trend in commodity consumption and the Land Cover Model simulates the total amount of land converted within 13 world regions during this period. Some degree of the spatial variability of deforestation has also been captured by the simulation. Applying the model to a ""Conventional Wisdom"" scenario showed that future trends of land conversions could be strikingly different on different continents even though a consistent scenario (IS92a from the IPCC) was used for assumptions about economic growth and population. Sensitivity analysis indicated that future land cover patterns are especially sensitive to assumed technological improvements in crop yield and computed changes in agricultural demand. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","agricultural demand; climate change; global change; land cover; land use","Agriculture; Calibration; Climatology; Computer simulation; Consumer products; Crops; Economic and social effects; Estimation; Mathematical models; Sensitivity analysis; Agricultural demand model; Climate change; Global change; Global land cover; Global terrestrial grid; Greenhouse gases; Land cover model; Land use; agriculture; air pollution; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; agricultural demand; climate change; climatic change; future scenario; global problem; IMAGE 2.0 model; land cover; land use; land-cover response; model; modelling approach",,,,,,"Addiscot, T.M., Whitemore, A.P., Powlson, D.S., (1991) Farming, Fertilizers and the Nitrate Problem, , CAB International, Oxon, U.K; Alcamo, J.M., G.J.J.
