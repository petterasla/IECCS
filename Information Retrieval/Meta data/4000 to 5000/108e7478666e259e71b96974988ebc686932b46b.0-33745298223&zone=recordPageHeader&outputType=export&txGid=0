When the ratio of the infrared radiation energy of the Earth's surface that is lost to outer space to the non-reflected average solar radiation energy is small, the model admits an accurate approximate analytical solution - the resulting energy balance equation of the model is a quartic equation that can be solved analytically - and thus provides an alternative solution and instructional strategy. A search through the literature fails to find an analytical solution, suggesting that the solution may be new. In this paper, we review the model, derive the approximation and obtain its solution. The dependence of the temperature of the surface of the Earth and the temperature of the atmosphere on seven parameters is made explicit. A simple and convenient formula for global warming (or cooling) in terms of the percentage change of the parameters is derived. The dependence of the surface temperature on the parameters is illustrated by several representative graphs. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Approximation theory; Graph theory; Greenhouse effect; Infrared radiation; Linear equations; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Problem solving; Solar radiation; Thermal effects; Earth's surface; Instructional strategy; Quartic equation; Surface temperature; Global warming",,,,,,"Boeker, E., Van Grondelle, R., (1999) Environmental Physics; Sorensen, B., (2004) Renewable Energy, pp. 208-209; Sorensen, B., (1979) Renewable Energy, pp. 205-206; Harvey, L.D.D., (2000) Global Warming the Hard Science; Mason, N., Hughes, P., (2001) Introduction to Environmental Physics Planet Earth, Life and Climate; Thorndike, E.H., (1976) Energy and Environment A Primer for Scientists and Engineers; Houghton, J., Global warming (2005) Rep.
