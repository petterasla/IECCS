Since the characteristics of the future regional climate are still uncertain and the response of our forests to changes in the atmospheric and climatic conditions may be both positive or negative, decision making in managed forests should consider the new risks and uncertainties arising from climatic change, especially if the rotation periods are long. An extended version of the forest gap model FORSKA was applied to simulate the forest development at 488 forest inventory plots in the federal state of Brandenburg, Germany, under two climate and three management scenarios. The transient growth dynamics from 1990 to 2100 were investigated at four sites in different parts of the state, representing the variability of environmental and forest conditions within Brandenburg. The alternative management strategies led to distinct differences in forest composition after 110 years of simulation. The projected climate change affected both forest productivity and species composition. The impacts of alternative management scenarios are discussed. It is concluded that the extended forest gap model can be a valuable tool to support decision making in forest management under global change.","Adaptation and mitigation strategies; Climate change; Forest management; Forest succession model; FORSKA","climate change; decision support system; forest management; gap dynamics; productivity",,,,,,"Botkin, D.B., Nisbet, R.A., Forest response to climatic change: Effects of parameter estimation and choice of weather pattern on the reliability of projections (1992) Climatic Change, 20, pp. 87-111; Bugmann, H., On the ecology of mountainous forests in a changing climate: A simulation study (1994), Ph.D. thesis, ETH ZurichBugmann, H., A simplified forest model to study species composition along climate gradients (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 2055-2074; Bugmann, H., Sensitivity of forests in the European Alps to future climatic change (1997) Climate Research, 8, pp. 35-44; Bugmann, H., Cramer, W., Improving the behaviour of forest gap models along drought gradients (1998) Forest Ecology and Management, 103, pp. 247-263; Bugmann, H., Grote, R., Lasch, P., Lindner, M., Suckow, F., A new forest gap model to study the effects of environmental change on forest structure and functioning (1997) Impacts of Global Change on Tree Physiology and Forest Ecosystems, pp. 255-261. , In: Mohren, G.M.J., Kramer, K. & Sabate, S.
