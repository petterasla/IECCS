Considerable year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10-yr study (1983-1992), with most extreme hot-dry conditions in 1988 during a 3-yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age-0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age-0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding on invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no-chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot-dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size-structured trophic interactions between age-0 fish along lake-stream gradients. Hot-dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species. The response of fish to climatic variation appears to be strongly influenced by their position in the 'hydrologic landscape.' The most dramatic fish response occurred in stream reaches influenced by groundwater.","Creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus); Dispersal; Environmental boundaries; Fish; Freshwater ecosystems; Global warming; Lake-stream interactions; Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides); Minnesota; Ontogenetic niches; Predator-prey interactions; Size-structured interactions; Temperature","climate; fish; growth rate; interspecific competition; predation; species interaction; United States; climate variation; growth; ichthyofauna; interspecific interaction; size effect; trophic interaction; United States; Micropterus salmoides; Semotilus atromaculatus",,,,,,"Angermeier, P.L., Resource seasonality and fish diets in an Illinois stream (1982) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 7, pp. 251-254; Angermeier, P.L., Smoger, R.A., Steele, S.D., An electric seine for collecting fish in streams (1991) North American Journal of Fisheries Management, 11, pp. 352-357; Bayley, P.B., Sampling problems in freshwater fisheries (1985) Proceedings of the Fourth British Freshwater Fisheries Conference, pp. 3-13. , K.
