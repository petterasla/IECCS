The comparisons were performed with daily mean temperature and daily precipitation amounts for the continental climate of the state of Nebraska, USA. Both the T21 and the T42 versions resulted in an increase of daily mean temperature under a 2 × CO2 climate. The magnitude of warming was substantially greater for T21 than for T42, except for February and June and at some stations in July where the T42 model suggested greater warming. Both GCMs resulted in a slight decrease in precipitation frequency and an increase in the amount of precipitation on wet days. Here, the T42 model again led to smaller changes. Different locations within Nebraska exhibited somewhat different temperature and precipitation responses with both GCM versions.",,"climate change; GCM; model downscaling; precipitation; scale effect; temperature; USA, Nebraska; Climate; General Circulation Model; Global Warming; Local; Precipitation",,,,,,"Bardossy, A., Plate, E., Space-time model for daily rainfall using atmospheric circulation patterns (1992) Wat.
