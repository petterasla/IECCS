In this study the performance potential of the carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle is investigated theoretically. For this purpose, two cycle simulation models were developed. One is an Evans-Perkins cycle model for R-22, and the other is a transcritical cycle model for CO2. By using these models, the CO2 refrigeration cycle and heat exchangers for the CO2 refrigeration cycle were optimized. The water chilling and tap water heating performances of CO2 were compared to those of R-22. The thermophysical properties of CO2 and the proper heat exchanger design appropriate to CO2 offer the opportunity of reducing heat exchanger size and mass for tap water heating applications.",,"Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Heat exchangers; Mathematical models; Optimization; Refrigeration; Evans-Perkins cycle model; Refrigeration cycle; Tap water heating; Water chilling; Refrigerants",,,,,,,"Hwang, Yunho; Univ of Maryland, College Park, United States",,,"ASHRAE, Atlanta, GA, United States","Proceedings of the 1999 ASHRAE Winter Meeting","23 January 1999 through 27 January 1999","Chicago, IL, USA",55431,00012505,,ASHTA,,"English","ASHRAE Trans",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032645399
