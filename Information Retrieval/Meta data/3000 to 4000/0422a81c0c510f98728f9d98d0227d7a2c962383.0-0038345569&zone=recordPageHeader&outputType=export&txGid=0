These systems play essential roles in regional-to-continental scale climate fluctuation and vegetation activity in response to global change. Using the Pathfinder AVHRR NDVI (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data for the period 1982-2000, the authors investigated the relationship of the inter-annual variations of spring NDVI to nine large-scale climate indices. On average, 57.2% of the satellite-sensed NDVI variance was explained. These climate indices also accounted for a large portion of the trends in NDVI as observed in five regions, namely, north-west North America (climate-related trend was 18.2% /10 years), south-eastern North America (5.8% /10 years), Europe (6.9% /10 years), high-latitude Asia (12.4% /10 years), and East Asia (8.0% /10 years). The results are useful for understanding and predicting the regional-to-continental NDVI variations in response to global climate change.",,"Climate change; Image sensors; Satellites; Vegetation; Climate indices; Remote sensing; AVHRR; climate change; NDVI; NOAA satellite; Northern Hemisphere; spring (season); vegetation dynamics",,,,,,"Gong, D.-Y., Ho, C.-H., Detection of large-scale climate signals in spring vegetation index (NDVI) over the northern hemisphere (2002) Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmosphere, , in revision; Hurrell, J.W., Decadal trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation: Regional temperatures and precipitation (1995) Science, 269, pp. 676-679; Hurrell, J.W., Influence of variations in extratropical wintertime teleconnections on northern hemisphere (1996) Geophysical Research Letters, 23, pp. 665-668; Climate change 2001: The scientific basis (2001) Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 1-881. , IPCC, edited by J.
