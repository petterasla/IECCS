This is a test, within a model context, of proposals that have been advanced to use knowledge of the present day climate to make ""empirical"" estimates of global climate sensitivity. The scaling of the topof-the-atmosphere infrared flux and the planetary albedo as functions of surface temperature was inferred by examining four different temporal and geographical variations of the control simulations. Each of these inferences greatly overestimates the climate sensitivity of the model, largely because of the behavior of the cloud albedo. In each inference the control results suggest that cloudiness and albedo decrease with increasing surface temperature. However, the experiment with the increased solar constant actually has higher albedo and more cloudiness at most latitudes. The increased albedo is a strong negative feedback, and this helps account for the rather weak sensitivity of the climate in the NCAR model. To the extent that these model results apply to the real world, they suggest empirical evaluation of the scaling of global-mean radiative properties with surface temperature in the present day climate provides little useful guidance for estimates of the actual climate sensitivity to global changes. © Science Press 2008.","Climate sensitivity; Coupled GCM; Empirical estimates; Surface temperature",,,,,,,"Boer, G.J., Yu, B., Climate sensitivity and response (2003) Climatic Dyn., 20, pp. 415-429; Bonan, G.B., The land surface climatology of the NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM 1.0) coupled to the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM3) (1998) J.
