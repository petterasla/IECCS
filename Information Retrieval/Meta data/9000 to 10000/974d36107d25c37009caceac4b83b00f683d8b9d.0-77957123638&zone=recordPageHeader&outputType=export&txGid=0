A special attention is given to the global warming period started since 1976. It is shown that the intensity of air temperature increase on the reservoir shore during recent 30 years made up 0. 46-0. 56°C/10 years. The maximum increase in the water temperature at shore stations and in the surface layer was registered in July at an increase rate of 0.7-1. 2°C/10 years. The change in climate conditions resulted in the increase in low-water runoff, decrease in snowmelt flood volumes, and shift in the time of snowmelt flood start. © 2010 Allerton Press, Inc.",,"Air temperature; Climate condition; Hydrometeorological variables; Long-term variations; Reservoir area; Snowmelt; Surface layers; Water runoff; Water temperatures; Global warming; Snow melting systems; Reservoirs (water); air temperature; climate change; flooding; global warming; hydrological change; hydrometeorology; runoff; snowmelt; spatial variation; Russian Federation; Rybinsk Reservoir",,,,,,"","Litvinov, A.
