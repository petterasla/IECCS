Point-to-point comparisons between temperature and quantified hemagglutinins were performed for all species and for the major prevailing species. The comparisons show that the trends for both hemagglutinin evolution and temperature change run in a similar direction. Global warming has a consistent and progressive impact on the hemagglutinin evolution of influenza A viruses. © 2011 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.","Evolution; Global warming; Hemagglutinin; Influenza A virus; Mutation","Influenza virus hemagglutinin; article; evolution; genetics; greenhouse effect; Influenza virus A; Biological Evolution; Global Warming; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Influenza A virus; Influenza A virus; Influenzavirus A",,"Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus",,,,"Thomas, C.D., Cameron, A., Green, R.E., Bakkenes, M., Beaumont, L.J., Collingham, Y.C., Erasmus, B.F.N., Williams, S.E., Extinction risk from climate change (2004) Nature, 427 (6970), pp. 145-148. , DOI 10.1038/nature02121; Sym, D., Patel, P.N., El-Chaar, G.M., Seasonal, avian, and novel H1N1 influenza: Prevention and treatment modalities (2009) Ann Pharmacother, 43, pp. 2001-2011; Yan, S., Wu, G., What these trends suggest?
