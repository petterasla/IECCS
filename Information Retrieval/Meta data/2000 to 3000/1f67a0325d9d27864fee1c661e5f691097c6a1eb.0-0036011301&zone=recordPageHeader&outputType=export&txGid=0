Arabidopsis thaliana contains two photolyases specific for photoreactivation of either cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) or pyrimidine (6-4)pyrimidones (6-4PPs), the two major UV-B-induced photoproducts in DNA. Reduced FADH and a reduced pterin were identified as cofactors of the native Arabidopsis CPD photolyase protein. This is the first report of the chromophore composition of any native class II CPD photolyase protein to our knowledge. CPD photolyase protein levels vary between tissues and with leaf age and are highest in flowers and leaves of 3-5-week-old Arabidopsis plants. White light or UV-B irradiation induces CPD photolyase expression in Arabidopsis tissues. This contrasts with the 6-4PP photolyase protein which is constitutively expressed and not regulated by either white or UV-B light. Arabidopsis CPD and 6-4PP photolyase enzymes can remove UV-B-induced photoproducts from DNA in planta even when plants are grown under enhanced levels of UV-B irradiation and at elevated temperatures although the rate of removal of CPDs is slower at high growth temperatures. These studies indicate that Arabidopsis possesses the photorepair capacity to respond effectively to increased UV-B-induced DNA damage under conditions predicted to be representative of increases in UV-B irradiation levels at the Earth's surface and global warming in the twenty-first century.","6-4PP photolyase; Arabidopsis thaliana; CPD photolyase; UVB","Dimers; DNA; Enzymes; Global warming; Irradiation; Tissue; Ultraviolet radiation; Photoproducts; Plants (botany); Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Embryophyta; deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase; pyrimidine dimer; pyrimidine(6 4)pyrimidone photolyase; pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photolyase; adaptation; Arabidopsis; article; darkness; DNA damage; enzymology; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; genetics; isolation and purification; light; metabolism; plant leaf; plant stem; radiation exposure; temperature; ultraviolet radiation; Adaptation, Physiological; Arabidopsis; Darkness; Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase; DNA Damage; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Light; Plant Leaves; Plant Stems; Pyrimidine Dimers; Temperature; Ultraviolet Rays",,"Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase, EC 4.1.99.3; Pyrimidine Dimers; pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photolyase, EC 4.1.99.-",,,,"Ahmad, M., Jarilo, J., Klimczak, L., Landry, L., Peng, T., Last, R., Cashmore, A., An enzyme similar to animal type II photolyases mediates photoreactivation in Arabidopsis (1997) The Plant Cell, 9, pp. 199-207; Birnboim, H.C., Doly, J., A rapid alkaline extraction procedure for screening recombinant plasmid DNA (1979) Nucleic Acids Research, 7, pp. 1523-1523; Bornman, J.F., Target sites of UV-B radiation in photosynthesis of higher plants (1989) Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology, 4, pp. 145-158; Britt, A.B., DNA damage and repair in plants (1996) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology, 47, pp. 75-100; Britt, A.B., Molecular genetics of DNA repair in higher plants (1999) Trends in Plant Science, 4, pp. 20-25; Caldwell, M.M., Teramura, A.H., Tevin, M., Bornman, J.F., Bjorn, L.O., Kulandaivelu, G., Effects of increased solar radiation on terrestrial plants (1995) Ambio, 24, pp. 166-173; Chen, J.-J., Mitchell, D., Britt, A.B., A light-dependent pathway for the elimination of UV-induced pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidinone photoproducts in Arabidopsis thaliana (1994) The Plant Cell, 6, pp. 1311-1317; Ecker, A.P.M., Kooiman, P., Hessels, J.K.C., Yasui, A., DNA photoreactivating enzyme from the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans (1990) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 265, pp. 8009-8015; Featherstone, C., Jackson, S.P., DNA double-strand break repair (1999) Current Biology, 9, pp. R759-R761; Hada, M., Hashimoto, T., Shin, M., UV-B-induced DNA damage and its photorepair in nuclei and chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea L.
