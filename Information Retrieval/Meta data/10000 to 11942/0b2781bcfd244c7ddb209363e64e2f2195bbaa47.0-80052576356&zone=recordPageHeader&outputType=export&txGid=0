The ECCS introduces a new passive component called the advanced accumulator which integrates both functions of the conventional accumulator and the low-pressure pump without any moving parts. The advanced accumulator uses a new fluidics device that automatically regulates flow rates of injected water in case of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). This fluidics device is referred to as a flow damper. This paper describes the design method of the flow damper and the standpipe. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,"Design method; Emergency core cooling system; Injected water; Instrumentation and control system; Mitsubishi; Moving parts; New components; Passive components; Fluidics; Global warming; Loss of coolant accidents; Pressurized water reactors; Small nuclear reactors; Water supply; Water towers; Design",,,,,,"Fineblum, S.S., Vortex Diodes (1974) Proceedings of the Fluidic State-of-The-Art Symposium, Vol. 1, pp. 45-80. , 30 September-3 October; Kirshner, J.M., Katz, S., (1975) Design Theory of Fluidic Components, , Academic Press; Makihara, Y., Study of the PWR hybrid safety system (1993) Nuclear Engineering and Design, 144, pp. 247-256; Shiraishi, T., (1994) Emergency Water Supply System for Nuclear Reactor, , Japanese Patent H6-44060; Shiraishi, T., Flow Control by a Vortex (flow Damper) (1997) Turbo Machinery, 25 (9), pp. 54-61. , (in Japanese); Shiraishi, T., On Flow Controlled Accumulator for Mitsubishi's Simplified PWR (MS-300/600) (1991) Proc.
