Thus, there is a great urgency to create relocation plans for dangerous hillside aggregations that are not suitable for human settlement. The government of Taipei City in Taiwan has not properly addressed the assessment needs for decisions involving priority and budget allocation for these relocation projects. This study proposes a hybrid approach combining the Delphi method, fuzzy-logic inference system (FLIS), and the multi-objective programming (MOP) method to assist the city government in dealing with complex aggregation relocation decision problems. Twenty-four projects are tested by the proposed approach. Compared to the original relocation plan, results from this study reveal that the proposed approach is more objective and effective in relocation prioritization, project selection, budget utilization, and resource planning. These results will provide the city government with useful information for improving the relocation plan, thereby reducing the potential for human and material losses due to inadequate decision-making. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
