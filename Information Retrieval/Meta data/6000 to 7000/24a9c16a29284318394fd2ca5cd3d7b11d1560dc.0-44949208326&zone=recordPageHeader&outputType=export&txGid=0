However, there is very little evidence regarding the differential effects of climate change on the phenologies of different trophic levels and their potential effects on ecosystem functioning. The Japan Meteorological Agency has monitored the flowering of 4 Prunus tree species and the appearance date of the butterfly Pieris rapae (a proxy for potential pollinators) in spring at Nagano, Japan, since 1953. Flowering tended to occur earlier over the last 3 decades, whereas the appearance of the butterfly was delayed. The effects of climate and the timing of the sensitive period differ between both trophic levels. The plants were strongly affected by temperature (r = -0.87) 30 to 40 d prior to flowering, whereas the butterfly was less affected by temperature (r = -0.50), and the effects mainly occurred during the 15 d prior to its appearance. The temperature during the plants' sensitive period has increased sharply since 1953, whereas the temperature during the butterfly's sensitive period has not changed significantly. The phenologies of the plants and butterfly are changing in opposite directions because they use different climatic cues with different temporal trends. This is the first documentation of differential effects of climate change between plant and insect phenology in Japan. © Inter-Research 2008.","Daily temperature; Flowering; Global warming; Insect appearance; Phenology; Pieris rapae; Prunus","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants (botany); butterfly; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem function; flowering; global warming; phenology; temperature effect; tree; trophic level; Asia; Chubu; Eurasia; Far East; Honshu; Japan; Nagano; Hexapoda; Pieris rapae; Prunus",,,,,,"Ahola, M., Laaksonen, T., Sippola, K., Eeva, T., Rainio, K., Lehikoinen, E., Variation in climate warming along the migration route uncouples arrival and breeding dates (2004) Glob Change Biol, 10, pp. 1610-1617; Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Awmack, C., and others, Herbivory in global climate change research: Direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Glob Change Biol, 8, pp. 1-16; Both, C., Visser, M.E., Adjustment to climate change is constrained by arrival date in a long-distance migrant bird (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 296-298; Doi, H., Winter flowering phenology of Japanese apricot Prunus mume reflects climate change across Japan (2007) Clim Res, 34, pp. 99-104; Doi, H., Katano, I., Phenological timings of leaf budburst with climate change in Japan (2008) Agric For Meteorol, 148, pp. 512-516; Easterling, D.R., Horton, B., Jones, P.D., Peterson, T.C., and others, Maximum and minimum temperature trends for the globe (1997) Science, 277, pp. 364-367; Estrella, N., Sparks, T.H., Menzel, A., Trends and temperature response in the phenology of crops in Germany (2007) Glob Change Biol, 13, pp. 1737-1747; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Harris, I.T.B., Williamson, M.H., Relationships between first flowering date and temperature in the flora of a locality in central England (1995) Funct Ecol, 9, pp. 55-60; Gordo, O., Sanz, J.J., Phenology and climate change: A long-term study in a Mediterranean locality (2005) Oecologia, 146, pp. 484-495; Gordo, O., Sanz, J.J., Temporal trends in phenology of the honey bee Apis mellifera (L.) and the small white Pieris rapae (L.) in the Iberian Peninsula (1952-2004) (2006) Ecol Entomol, 31, pp. 261-268; Harrington, R., Woiwod, I., Sparks, T.H., Climate change and trophic interactions (1999) Trends Ecol Evol, 14, pp. 146-150; Inoue, T., (2004) Community structure of butterflies in the forestry and forest production research institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki prefecture, central Japan, 392, pp. 221-247. , Bulletin of Forestry & Forest Products Research Institue, in Japanese with English summary; Inouye, D.W., Barr, B., Armitage, K.B., Inouye, B.D., Climate change is affecting altitudinal migrants and hibernating species (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 97, pp. 1630-1633; (1985) Guidelines for the observation of phenology, , JMA (, 3rd edn.
