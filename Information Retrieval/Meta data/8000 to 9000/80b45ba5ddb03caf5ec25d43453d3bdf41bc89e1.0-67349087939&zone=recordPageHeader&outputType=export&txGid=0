All have wide-reaching physical and biological ecosystem effects in the region. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) calibrated radiance, snow cover extent, and vegetation index products for interpreting interannual variation in the duration and extent of snowpack, lake ice, and vegetation dynamics for southwest Alaska. The approach integrates multiple seasonal metrics across large ecological regions. Throughout the observation period (2001-2007), snow cover duration was stable within ecoregions, with variable start and end dates. The start of the lake ice season lagged the snow season by 2 to 3 months. Within a given lake, freeze-up dates varied in timing and duration, while break-up dates were more consistent. Vegetation phenology varied less than snow and ice metrics, with start-of-season dates comparatively consistent across years. The start of growing season and snow melt were related to one another as they are both temperature dependent. Higher than average temperatures during the El Niño winter of 2002-2003 were expressed in anomalous ice and snow season patterns. We are developing a consistent, MODIS-based dataset that will be used to monitor temporal trends of each of these seasonal metrics and to map areas of change for the study area.","Ecosystem monitoring; Lake ice; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Phenology; Snow cover","Ecosystem monitoring; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Phenology; Snow cover; Atmospherics; Climate change; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Ice; Image retrieval; Lakes; Nickel compounds; Radiometers; Snow; Spectrometers; Vegetation; annual variation; calibration; climate change; El Nino; global climate; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; seasonality; snowpack; vegetation dynamics; vegetation index; Alaska; North America; United States",,,,,,"Adams, L.G., Singer, F.J., Dale, B.W., Caribou calf mortality in Denali National Park, Alaska (1995) Journal of Wildlife Management, 59, pp. 584-594; Badhwar, G.D., Crop emergence date determination from spectral data (1982) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 46, pp. 369-377; Bradley, B.A., Jacob, R.W., Hermance, J.F., Mustard, J.F., A curve-fitting technique to derive inter-annual phenologies from time series of noisy satellite data (2007) Remote Sensing of Environment, 106, pp. 137-145; Courtin, G.M., Kalliomaki, N.M., Hillis, T., Robitaille, R.L., The effect of abiotic factors on the overwintering success in the meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus: Winter redefined (1991) Arctic and Alpine Research, 23, pp. 45-52; Crowley, T.J., Causes of climate change over the past 1000 years (2000) Science, 289 (5477), pp. 270-277; Davey, C.A., Redmond, K.T., Simeral, D.B., Weather and climate inventory, National Park Service, Southwest Alaska Network (2007) Natural resource technical report NPS/SWAN/NRTR-2007/045, , 80 pgs; Delbart, N., Kergoat, L., Le Toan, T., Lhermitte, J., Picard, G., Determination of phenological dates in boreal regions using normalized difference water index (2005) Remote Sensing of Environment, 97, pp. 26-38; Déry, S.J., Salomonson, V.V., Stieglitz, M., Hall, D.K., Appel, I., An approach for using snow areal depletion curves inferred from MODIS and its application to land surface modeling in Alaska (2005) Hydrological Processes, 19, pp. 2755-2774; Dye, D.G., Tucker, C.J., Seasonality and trends of snow-cover, vegetation index, and temperature in northern Eurasia (2003) Geophysical Research Letters, 39 (7), p. 1405. , 10.1029/2002GL016384; Fancy, S.G., Gross, J.E., Carter, S.L., Monitoring the condition of natural resources in U.
