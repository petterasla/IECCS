Tide in this HGDB branch is semi-diurnal showing daily, monthly and yearly time versus water level asymmetry. This branch is at present microtidal in nature having tidal range in between 0.41-1.78 m, though mean water level varies from 0.87-5.18 m above average mean sea level. Geomorphologically the study area is divided into estuarine plain in south and deltaic plain in north with estuarine channel in between. The 3 m high bank cliff section of the 26 km long estuarine channel at 32 sites recognizes seven litho-facies. The litho-facies - finely laminated sand and silt (facies A), finely laminated silt and clay (facies B), laminated sand-clay (sub-facies C1), alternating clay and organic matter (facies D) and rippled laminated sand (facies G) are tide generated. Crudely laminated to massive clay (facies E) and clay with ripple laminated silt and sand (facies F) are interdistributary bay/swamp and deltaic plain deposits respectively. Sub-facies C2 (massive sand) and some ripples within facies B and G are storm/flood and wave influenced deposits respectively. The morphological straight- meander- straight divisions of the HGDB estuarine reach can be zoned as funnel- meander- head on the basis of channel morphology, sedimentary structure, facies and sand+silt:clay ratio of sedimentary succession. Rhythmic occurrence of sand-silt, silt-clay and clay-organic matter with sedimentary structures of parallel- and wavy-lamination along with occasional lenticular-, flaser-, and bi-directional cross-lamination and plained off ripples of facies A, B, D and sub- facies C1 are tide generated. Some ripples in facies B and G and sub-facies C2 are wave and storm/flood generated. These laterally change to massive to crudely laminated clay with minor amount of rippled sand and silt embedded with soil peds and root traces of delta originated facies E and F in headward direction and vertically up the succession. This is a well-recognized geologically predictable spatial variation when estuary is linked up with delta in landward direction and when delta progrades down the estuary with time. The relative influence of tide (facies A, B, D and sub-facies C1), wave (part of facies B and G and sub-facies C2) and river (deltaic facies E and F) is well reflected in this zonation. The facies A, B, C and D were deposited in an estuarine environmental set up that was established in the study area immediately after the mid-Holocene 7000-5000 years BP marine transgression. The Ganges delta was shaped and started progradation towards southeast direction probably after the late Holocene sea level fall at around 3000 years BP when the Bhagirathi, now in West Bengal, shifted toward east through Mathabhang, Bhairab-Pushar, Garai-Madhumati-Haringhata, Arial Khan to Padma, the new main branch of the Ganges in Bangladesh. The Padma might have met the old Meghna at around 1110 ± 90 years BP and facies E and F deposited in a deltaic environment at a later time when the Ganges delta prograded to the present position. Facies G is a tidal bar deposit within the present estuarine channel. The Ganges delta is still prograding southeastward, but at a much reduced rate due to present trend of global warming initiating a new sea level rise. © Geol. Soc.
