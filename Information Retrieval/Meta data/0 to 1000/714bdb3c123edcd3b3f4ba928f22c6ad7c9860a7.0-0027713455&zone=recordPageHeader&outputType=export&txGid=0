This analysis shows that most of the near-term fossil fuel-based alternatives would not dramatically reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. However, in the long run, several ultra- low-emission fuels and technologies are available. The major uncertainties in the analysis are the efficiency of energy use, the warming potential of greenhouse gases other than CO2 and the economic and political context in which energy is used. © 1993.",,"electricity generation; global warming; greenhouse gas; pollution emission",,,,,,"DeLuchi, (1991) Emissions of Greenhouse Gases from the Use of Transportation Fuels and Electricity, , Center for Transportation Research, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, November; DeLuchi, Ogden, Solar-hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (1991) Transpn.
