Countries belonging to Annex I Parties are obligated to meet their target in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper broadens the scope of research to compare the performance between two groups, Annex II Parties and economies in transition (EIT) Parties (both of which are in the set of Annex I Parties), undertaking responsibilities for GHG emission reduction. This differs from the traditional application of evaluation and aims to identify inherent efficiency differences across systems, rather than separately from the potential inefficiency of individual countries. An efficiency gap was found between the group of Annex II Parties and the group of EIT Parties, by adjusting efficiency levels. Considering a reference set, efficient Annex II countries are referenced, both within their own group and within the EIT group; efficient EIT countries are only benchmarked within the group. The evidence provided can shed light on the function of joint implementation, that Annex I countries will cooperate to reduce GHG emissions, based on their common, but differentiated, responsibilities and capacity for global climate change.","Annex I parties; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; GHG emissions; System","climate change; efficiency measurement; emission; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol",,,,,,"Brockett, P.L., Golany, B., Using rank statistics for determining programmatic efficiency differences in data envelopment analysis (1996) Management Science, 42 (3), pp. 466-472; Cooper, W.W., Seiford, L.M., Tone, K., (2002) Data Envelopment Analysis: A Comprehensive Text with Models, Applications, References and DEA-Solver Software, , Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers;; Färe, R., Grosskopf, S., Lovell, C.A.K., Pasurka, C., Multilateral productivity comparisons when some outputs are undesirable: A nonparametric approach (1989) Review of Economics and Statistics, 71, pp. 90-98; Ganley, J.A., Cubbin, J.S., (1992) Public Sector Efficiency Measurement: Applications of Data Envelopment Analysis, , Amsterdam: North-Holland;; Lo, S.F., Sheu, H.J., Hu, J.L., Taking CO2 emissions into a country's productivity change: The Asian growth experience (2005) International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 12 (3), pp. 279-290; Lovell, C.A.K., Pastor, J.T., Turner, J.A., Measuring macroeconomic performance in the OECD: A comparison of European and non-European countries (1995) European Journal of Operational Research, 87, pp. 507-518; Missfeldt, F., Villavicenco, A., (2002) How can economies in transition pursue emissions trading or joint implementation, , Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, UMEP Collaborating Centre on Energy and Environment.
