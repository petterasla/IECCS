Our study evaluates the environmental consequences of waste prevention on waste management systems and on the wider society, using life-cycle thinking. The partial prevention of unsolicited mail, beverage packaging and food waste is tested for a ""High-tech"" waste management system relying on high energy and material recovery and for a ""Low-tech"" waste management system with less recycling and relying on landfilling. Prevention of 13% of the waste mass entering the waste management system generates a reduction of loads and savings in the waste management system for the different impacts categories; 45% net reduction for nutrient enrichment and 12% reduction for global warming potential. When expanding our system and including avoided production incurred by the prevention measures, large savings are observed (15-fold improvement for nutrient enrichment and 2-fold for global warming potential). Prevention of food waste has the highest environmental impact saving. Prevention generates relatively higher overall relative benefit for ""Low-tech"" systems depending on landfilling. The paper provides clear evidence of the environmental benefits of waste prevention and has specific relevance in climate change mitigation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","EASEWASTE; Environmental impacts; Food waste; LCA; Modelling; Municipal waste; Packaging waste; Unsolicited mail; Waste prevention","EASEWASTE; Food waste; LCA; Modelling; Municipal waste; Packaging waste; Unsolicited mails; Waste prevention; Beverages; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Global warming; Nutrients; Renewable energy resources; Waste management; environmental impact assessment; landfill; life cycle analysis; modeling; municipal solid waste; packaging waste; quantitative analysis; recycling; waste management; article; climate change; economic aspect; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; nutrient content; priority journal; recycling; waste disposal; waste management; waste prevention; Climate Change; Environment; Garbage; Models, Theoretical; Product Packaging; Recycling; Waste Management; Waste Products",,"Waste Products",,,,"Christensen, T.H., Simion, F., Tonini, D., Moller, J., Global warming factors modelled for 40 generic municipal waste management scenarios (2009) Waste Management Research, 27, pp. 871-884; Christensen, T.H., Bhander, G.S., Lindvall, H.K., Larsen, A.W., Fruergaard, T., Damgaard, A., Manfredi, S., Hauschild, M.Z., Experience with the use of LCA-modelling (EASEWASTE) in waste management (2007) Waste Management and Research, 25, pp. 257-262; Cleary, J., The incorporation of waste prevention activities into life cycle assessments of municipal solid waste management systems: methodological issues (2010) The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 15, pp. 579-589; Cox, J., Giorgi, S., Sharp, V., Strange, K., Wilson, D.C., Blakey, N., Household waste prevention - A review of evidence (2010) Waste Management Research, 28, pp. 193-219; (2009), http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/municipal-waste-generation/municipal-waste-generation-assessment-published-2, EEA.
