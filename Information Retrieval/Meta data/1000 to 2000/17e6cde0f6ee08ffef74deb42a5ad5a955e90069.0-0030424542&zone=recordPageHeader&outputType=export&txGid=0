The road transport sector's contributions to this problem are then detailed and various policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars are discussed. The paper then describes a model which forecasts greenhouse gas emissions from cars. The effects of various policy options are then modelled and the results compared. Policies considered include: raising fuel prices in terms of the UK government's commitment to increase road fuel duties; subsidising public transport in terms of reduced public transport fares; and a tax differentiated by engine size.","Emissions; Global warming; Petrol tax; Road transport; Subsidies","Automobiles; Crude petroleum; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Motor transportation; Public policy; Taxation; Transportation charges; Great Britain; Greenhouse gas emissions; Petrol tax; Road transport; Subsidies; Global warming; global warming; greenhouse gas; modelling approach; policy evaluation; pollution control; road transport; transport emissions; UK",,,,,,"(1989) National Road Traffic Forecasts (Great Britain) 1989, , HMSO, London; Pearce, D.W., Turner, R.K., (1990) Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment, , Harvester Wheatsheaf, London; Baumol, W.J., Oates, W.E., (1988) The Theory of Environmental Policy (2nd Edition), , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Whitelegg, J., Gatrell, A., Naumann, P., (1993) Traffic and Health, , Environmental Epidemiology Unit, University of Lancaster; Grubb, M., (1989) The Greenhouse Effect: Negotiating Targets, p. 5. , Royal Institute of International Affairs, London; (1994) Climate Change: The UK Programme, , HMSO, London; (1993) Planning Policy Guidance Note 13, Transport, , Department of the Environment, London; (1993) Paying for Better Motorways: Issues for Discussion, , HMSO, London; Fankhauser, S., (1994) Valuing Climate Change: The Economics of the Greenhouse Effect, , Earthscan, London; (1986) Environmental Effects of Automotive Transport, , The OECD Compass Project, Paris; (1992) New Car Fuel Consumption: The Official Figures, , Department of Transport, London; Martin, D., Shock, R.A.W., (1989) Energy Use and Energy Efficiency in UK Transport Up to the Year 2010, , HMSO, London; Op. cit(1992) Vehicle Speeds in Great Britain 1992, , Department of Transport, London; Acutt, M.Z., Dodgson, J.S., (1994) A Price-Sensitive Model for Forecasting Car Emissions, , Paper presented to UTSG Annual Conference, University of Leeds; Dodgson, J.S., Kneller, R.A., (1994) Goods Vehicle Fuel Consumption and Emission Forecasts, , University of Liverpool, September; Acutt, M.Z., Dodgson, J.S., Multi-model national traffic forecasts (1994) Transportation Planning Methods Volume I, 1. , Proceedings of Seminar G, PTRC 22nd European Transport Forum; (1992) Transport Statistics Great Britain 1992, , HMSO, London, Table 2.2; (1993) National Travel Survey 1989-1991, , HMSO, London; Op. citOp. citSorrell, S., Fuel efficiency in the UK vehicle stock (1992) Energy Policy, 19, pp. 766-780; Rice, P., A review of GB vehicle fuel efficiency and price-induced energy conservation, 1973-1984 (1985) Traffic Engineering and Control, 26, pp. 425-433; Eggleston, H.S., (1992) Pollution in the Atmosphere Future Emissions from the UK, , Warren Spring Laboratory, Stevenage; Acutt, M.Z., (1994) Greenhouse Gas Emissions from the Car Model, , University of Liverpool, August","Acutt, M.Z.; Department of Economics, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,03081060,,,,"English","Transp.
