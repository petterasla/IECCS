In this work, the reuse of anaerobically digested sludge in agriculture is evaluated from an environmental point of view by using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. More specifically, the potential impacts of emerging micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, present in the sludge have been quantified. Four scenarios were considered according to the temperature of the anaerobic digestion (mesophilic or thermophilic) and the sludge retention time (20 or 10. d), and they have been compared with the non-treated sludge.From an environmental point of view, the disposal of undigested sludge is not the most suitable alternative, except for global warming due to the dominance (65-85%) of the indirect emissions associated to the electricity use. Nutrient-related direct emissions dominate the eutrophication category impact in all the scenarios (>71.4%), although a beneficial impact related to the avoidance of industrial fertilisers production is also quantified (up to 6.7%). In terms of human and terrestrial toxicity, the direct emissions of heavy metals to soil dominate these two impact categories (>70%), and the contribution of other micropollutants is minimal. Moreover, only six (Galaxolide, Tonalide, Diazepam, Ibuprofen, Sulfamethoxazole and 17α-ethinyloestradiol) out of the 13 substances considered are really significant since they account for more than 95% of the overall micropollutants impact. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Anaerobic digestion; Land disposal; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs); Potential toxicity impacts; Waste management","Land disposal; Life-cycle assessments; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs); Potential toxicity impacts; Agriculture; Drug products; Eutrophication; Global warming; Heavy metals; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Sludge disposal; Toxicity; Waste management; Anaerobic digestion; ammonia; cadmium; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; chromium; copper; cosmetic; diazepam; estradiol; estrone; ethinylestradiol; fertilizer; galaxolide; heavy metal; ibuprofen; iron; lead; mercury; methane; nickel; nitrous oxide; roxithromycin; sulfamethoxazole; zinc; agricultural application; anoxic conditions; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; sewage treatment; toxicity; waste management; agriculture; anaerobic digestion; article; controlled study; electricity; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; priority journal; quantitative analysis; recycling; sludge; sludge treatment; soil pollution; temperature; waste disposal; Anaerobiosis; Benzopyrans; Diazepam; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Ibuprofen; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Public Health; Sulfamethoxazole; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; chromium, 14092-98-9, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; diazepam, 439-14-5; estradiol, 50-28-2; estrone, 53-16-7; ethinylestradiol, 57-63-6; galaxolide, 1222-05-5; ibuprofen, 15687-27-1; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; lead, 13966-28-4, 7439-92-1; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; methane, 74-82-8; nickel, 7440-02-0; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; roxithromycin, 80214-83-1; sulfamethoxazole, 723-46-6; zinc, 14378-32-6, 7440-66-6; Benzopyrans; Diazepam, 439-14-5; Ibuprofen, 15687-27-1; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Sulfamethoxazole, 723-46-6; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; acetyl methyl tetramethyl tetralin, 21145-77-7; galaxolide, 1222-05-5",,,,"Baumann, H., Tillman, A.M., (2004) The Hitch Hiker's guide to LCA.
