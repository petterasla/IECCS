Carbon-oriented management of forests also offers forest owners an opportunity to obtain a new source of income, and commonly has environmental co-benefits. The USA is developing climate change policy that recognizes forestry as a source of offsets in carbon markets, and the emissions trading programs and standards that have developed to date offer opportunities for afforestation, reforestation, reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and improved forest management projects. Private forest owners are key players in carbon markets because they own over half of the forest land in the USA and carbon offsetting from public forest land is rare. However, a number of environmental, economic, and social constraints currently limit carbon market participation by forest owners. Key issues include: the low price of carbon and high cost of market entry; whether small landowners can gain market access; how to meet requirements such as management plans and certification; and whether managing for carbon is consistent with other forest management goals. This paper provides an overview of current and emerging opportunities for family forest owners to contribute to climate change mitigation in the USA, and explores ways of overcoming some of the challenges so that they can take advantage of these opportunities. © 2010 US Government employee.","Carbon markets; Family forest owners; Forest carbon offsets","carbon sequestration; climate change; emissions trading; forest management; landowner; small scale industry; United States",,,,,,"Alig, R.J., US landowner behavior, land use and land cover changes, and climate change mitigation (2003) Silva Fennica, 37 (4), pp. 511-527; Beach, R.H., Pattanayak, S.K., Yang, J.C., Murray, B.C., Abt, R.C., Econometric studies of non-industrial private forest management: a review and synthesis (2005) For Policy Econ, 7 (3), pp. 261-281. , doi:10.1016/S1389-9341(03)00065-0; Beddoe, R., Danks, C., (2009) Carbon trading: A joint effort between the Delta Institute, Illinois, and Michigan, , http://www.uvm.edu/~cfcm/?Page=interim_products.html, Case study, Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, University of Vermont; Bliss, J.C., Kelly, E.C., Comparative advantages of small-scale forestry among emerging forest tenures (2008) J Small-scale For, 7 (1), pp. 95-104. , doi: 10. 1007/s11842-008-9043-5; Breshears, D.B., Cobb, N.S., Rich, P.M., Regional vegetation die-off in response to global-change-type drought (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 102 (42), pp. 144-148. , doi: 10. 1073/pnas. 0505734102; Butler, B.J., (2008) Family forest owners of the United States, 2006, , USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station GTR-NRS-27, Newtown Square; Capoor, K., Ambrosi, P., (2009) State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2009, , Washington, DC: The World Bank; Chen, W., Chen, J.M., Price, D.T., Cihlar, J., Liu, J., Carbon offset potentials of four alternative forest management strategies in Canada: a simulation study (2000) Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Chang, 5 (2), pp. 143-169. , doi:10.1023/A:1009671422344; Cortner, H.J., Introduction (2008) Wildfire Risk: Human Perceptions and Management Implications, pp. 1-6. , W.
