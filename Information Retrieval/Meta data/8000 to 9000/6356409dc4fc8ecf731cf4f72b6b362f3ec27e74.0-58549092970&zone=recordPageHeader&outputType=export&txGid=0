Thermochemical water-splitting theoretically offers a higher overall efficiency than high-temperature electrolysis of water because heat from the nuclear reactor is provided directly to the hydrogen generation process, instead of using the intermediate step of generating electricity. The primary heat source for the S-I cycle is an advanced nuclear reactor operating at temperatures corresponding to those required by the sulfur-iodine process. This LCA examines the environmental impact of the combined advanced nuclear and hydrogen generation plants and focuses on quantifying the emissions of carbon dioxide per kilogram of hydrogen produced. The results are presented in terms of global warming potential (GWP). The GWP of the system is 2500 g carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-eq) per kilogram of hydrogen produced. The GWP of this process is approximately one-sixth of that for hydrogen production by steam reforming of natural gas, and is comparable to producing hydrogen from wind- or hydro-electric conventional electrolysis. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Life cycle analysis; Nuclear production of hydrogen; Sulfur-iodine cycle","Carbon dioxide; Electric generators; Electrochemistry; Electrolysis; Environmental impact; Gas fuel manufacture; Gas industry; Gas producers; Global warming; Hydrogen; Industrial chemicals; Iodine; Life cycle; Nonmetals; Nuclear energy; Nuclear propulsion; Nuclear reactors; Oxides; Steam engineering; Sulfur; Global-warming potential (GWP); Heat sourcing; Hydrogen generations; Hydrogen-generation process; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle assessment (LCA)); Nuclear production of hydrogen; S I cycle; Steam reforming; Sulfur-iodine cycle; Hydrogen production",,,,,,"Brown, L., Besenbruch, G., Lentsch, R., Schultz, K., Funk, J., Pickard, P., (2003) High efficiency generation of hydrogen fuels using nuclear power.
