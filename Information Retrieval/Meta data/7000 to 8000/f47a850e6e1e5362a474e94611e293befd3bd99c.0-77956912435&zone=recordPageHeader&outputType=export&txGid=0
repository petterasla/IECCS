Rapid urbanization is transforming landscapes from vegetation to an engineered infrastructure and thus altering land cover and land use. These alterations impact urban and global climate change, energy demand, human health, and ecological service functions. This article presents an overview of a refined land-cover classification protocol that seeks to refine current land-cover classifications of engineered paved surfaces. This new approach provides those who model urban systems and engineer the environment as well as other scientists and policy makers an expanded understanding of how intervention to the system can most effectively be accomplished through enhanced modeling. An object-oriented analysis regime is presented for an industrial park utilizing commercial software in conjunction with multispectraland panchromatic Quickbird satellite imagery. A detailed examination of hot-mix asphalt paved surfaces was undertaken in relation to the materials' engineered function such as various types of streets, parking, etc. The results were validated using a commercial raster graphics editor and data analysis software as well as on-site inspections. An overall accuracy of 95% was achieved.
