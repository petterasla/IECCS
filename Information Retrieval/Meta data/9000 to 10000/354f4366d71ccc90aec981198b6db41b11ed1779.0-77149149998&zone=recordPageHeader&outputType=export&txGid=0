In the majority of the country, the length of summer has extended and the length of winter has shortened since the 1950s. These changes in the lengths of seasons are linked to the changes in the starting dates of seasons. Namely, the starting date of summer has advanced and the starting date of winter has shifted back. Averaged across the whole country, the starting date of summer has been brought forward by 5. 8 days and the season has extended 9 days. On the other hand, the starting date of winter has been delayed by 5. 6 days and the season has shortened by 11 days. The changes for spring and fall are relatively smaller. Particularly, spring has started earlier by 5. 7 days but shortened by 0. 3 day, and fall has started later by 3. 2 days but lengthened by 2. 3 days. The changes in seasons exhibit apparent regional differences. They are more significant in the north than in the south where the trend of some local changes in seasons is opposite to that of the rest of the country. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Daily temperatures; Global warming; global warming; regional climate; seasonality; temperature gradient; weather station; China",,,,,,"Chen, X.Q., Zhang, F.C., Spring phonological change in Beijing in the last 50 years and its response to the climate changes (2001) Agric Meteorol, 22, pp. 1-5; de Viron, O., Dehant, V., Goosse, H., Crucifix, M., Galvin, A.B., Effect of global warming on the length-of-day (2002) Geophy Res Lett, 29, p. 1146. , doi:10.1029/2001GL013672; Ding, Y.H., Dai, X.S., Temperature variation in China during the last 100 years (1994) Meteorol Monthly, 20, pp. 19-26; Fu, C.B., Dong, W.J., Wen, G., Ye, D.Z., Regional response and adaptation to global change (2003) Acta Meteorol Sin, 61, pp. 245-250; Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, J.J., (2001) Climate Change 2001, pp. 194-238. , The IPCC scientific assessment, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , http://www.ipcc.ch, IPCC, Contribution of working group I to the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change.
