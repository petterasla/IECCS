The main reaction of the process is the extraction of calcium ions from waste concrete particles by use of pressurized carbon dioxide (several MPa in pressure). The extracted Ca2+ is deposited as calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles when the pressure is reduced to the atmospheric pressure. The CaCO3 particles can either be disposed of directly or reused industrially for cement production. The former case is a direct disposal of CO2; the latter case is an indirect disposal of CO2, because the net mining amount of virgin limestone could be reduced. Energy consumption and cost for the fixation process of CO2, emitted from a 100-MW thermal power plant by the proposed process was evaluated based on laboratory scale experimental results. It was found that energy consumption for the operation was 3.5 MW per 100-MW power generation, and the fixation cost was about JPY 2100 per metricton of carbon. This result indicates that the present process is highly competitive with the previous CO2 fixation scenarios such as ocean sequestration.","CO2 fixation; Concrete; Global warming; Material recycle; Waste product","Concretes; Energy utilization; Extraction; Limestone; Particles (particulate matter); Positive ions; Pressure effects; Reduction; Waste treatment; Waste concretes; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Halmann, M.M., Steinberg, M., (1998) Greenhouse Gas Carbon Dioxide Mitigation, , Lewis Publishers Inc., Chelsea, USA; Kakizawa, M., Yamasaki, A., Yanagisawa, Y., A new CO2 disposal process via artificial weathering of calcium silicate accelerated by acetic acid (2001) Energy, 26, pp. 341-354; Kagakukougakukai, (1999) Kagaku Kogaku Binran, 6th ed., , Maruzen, Tokyo, Japan; Kaya, Y., (1999) Kannkyo Nenpyo 2000/2001, , Ohmsha, Tokyo, Japan; Kojima, T., Nagamine, A., Ueno, N., Uemiya, S., Absorption and fixation of carbon dioxide by rock weathering (1997) Energy Conv.
