We determined CH4 concentration in 216 groundwaters used for agriculture in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, and analyzed the spatial and seasonal variations. The percentage of CH4-detected samples and mean CH4 concentration were high in deltaic regions, 88% and 239 μmol L-1(n = 24) or 69% and 166 μmol L-1 (n = 49), low in alluvial fan (0%; n = 12) and mountainous area (35% and 11.7 μmol L-1(n = 22)). Methane was more frequently detected in groundwater with &gt;50 m depth (84%; n = 37). Mean CH4 concentration for CH4-detected samples from &gt;50 m depth was also higher than those from &lt;5 m depth, 248 versus 60.2 μmol L-1. Among groundwater samples with &lt;5 m depth, the probability of CH4 detection was higher under paddy fields. Seasonal variations in the concentration and stable C isotopic ratio of CH4 (δ 13CC H4; -65 to -89‰) were generally small in monitored groundwaters with 4-180 m depth, suggesting that CH4 produced mainly by CO2 reduction was preserved through a year. There were also shallow groundwaters (&lt;5 m depth) showing adverse seasonal changes in CH4 concentration and δ 13CC H4 (up to 20‰). Such shallow groundwaters showed significant CH4 production in a 90-day incubation with maximum rates of 3.03-6.43 nmol day-1. Acetoclastic methanogens were generally absent, while an addition of glucose and especially CO2/H2 enhanced methanogenesis. CH4 oxidizing potential was also observed in an aerobic incubation. These results suggested that the production/oxidation of CH4 in situ or at the source was responsible for the seasonal variations in CH4 concentration. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
