The anticipated population increase and global climate change raise further concerns on the future. Transboundary and other shared waters have been the sources of numerous conflicts between the countries and communities sharing them, and there are fears that many of these shared basins will be hotspots for violent conflicts in this century. Proper planning and management of these shared waters will play a key role in resolving future water problems and conflicts. Despite the many existing legal frameworks and bilateral/multilateral agreements, tremendous challenges remain in managing the shared waters. These challenges have scientific, political, economic, environmental, social, cultural, racial, religious, linguistic and other facets. This study discusses the human side of water planning, management and conflicts. The positive and negative effects of water planning and management on human life are presented, with particular emphasis on human behaviour. How these effects, in turn, can shape our perception of water planning and management and motivate us towards specific agenda(s) is also discussed. The water dispute in an inter-state river basin (the Cauvery River basin) in south India is chosen as a representative for discussion. It is argued that studying the transactions between humans and water-related activities should be an integral part of water research. The field of ""hydropsychology"" is proposed for this kind of study, and a few ideas are also presented for making fundamental advances. © 2011 IAHS Press.","Human behaviour; Hydrology; Hydropsychology; Transboundary waters; Water crisis and conflict; Water planning and management","Human behaviour; Hydropsychology; Transboundary water; Water crisis and conflict; Water planning and management; Behavioral research; Climate change; Planning; Social sciences; Watersheds; Water resources; bilateral agreement; conflict management; crisis management; dispute resolution; freshwater; human behavior; legislation; perception; water management; water planning; Cauvery Basin; India",,,,,,"Abraham, F.D., Gilgen, A.R., (1995) Chaos theory in psychology, , Connecticut: Praeger; Benjamin, N., Cauvery waters dispute (1971) Economic and Political Weekly, 6 (34), pp. 1794-1795; Biswas, A.K., Tortajada, C., Izquierdo, R., (2009) Water management in 2020 and beyond, , (eds.), Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Cassidy, T., (1997) Environmental psychology: Behaviour and experience in context, , East Sussex, UK: Psychology Press Ltd; (2007) Report of the Cauvery water disputes tribunal with the decision, 5. , Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT), New Delhi: CWDT; Cooley, H., Gleick, P.H., Climate-proofing transboundary water agreements (2011) Hydrological Sciences Journal, 56 (4), pp. 711-718; D'Souza, D., (2002) What a lovely water war!, , http://www.rediff.com, Rediff News, 15 October Available from:, [Accessed March 2004]; Delli Priscoli, J., Wolf, A.T., (2009) Managing and transforming water conflicts, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Earle, A., Jägerskog, A., Öjendal, J., (2010) Transboundary water management: Principles and practice, , London: Earthscan; Elhance, A.P., (1999) Hydropolitics in the Third World: Conflict and cooperation in international river basins, , Washington, DC: USA Institute of Peace Press; Gleick, P.H., Water in the 21st century (1993) Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Fresh Water Resources, pp. 105-113. , In: P.H.
