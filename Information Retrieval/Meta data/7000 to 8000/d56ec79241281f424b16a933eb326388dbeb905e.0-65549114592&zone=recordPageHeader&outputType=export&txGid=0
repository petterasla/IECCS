This feedback activates at increased greenhouse gas concentrations. It may help to explain the warm ""equable climates"" of the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene eras (∼100 to ∼35 million years ago) and may be relevant for future climate under global warming. Here, the factors that determine the critical threshold CO2 concentration at which this feedback is active and the magnitude of the warming caused by the feedback are analyzed using both a highly idealized model and NCAR's single-column atmospheric model (SCAM) run under Arctic-like conditions. The critical CO2 is particularly important because it helps to establish the relevance of the feedback for past and future climates. Both models agree that increased heat flux into the high latitudes at low altitudes generally decreases the critical CO2. Increases in oceanic heat transport and in solar radiation absorbed during the summer should cause a sharp decrease in the critical CO2, but the effect of increases in atmospheric heat transport depends on its vertical distribution. It is furthermore found (i) that if the onset of convection produces more clouds and moisture, the critical CO2 should decrease, and the maximum temperature increase caused by the convective cloud feedback should increase and (ii) that reducing the depth of convection reduces the critical CO2 but has little effect on the maximum temperature increase caused by the convective cloud feedback. These results should help with interpretation of the strength and onset of the convective cloud feedback as found, for example, in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) coupled ocean - atmosphere models with different cloud and convection schemes. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric heats; Atmospheric models; Convective clouds; Critical thresholds; Future climates; Green house gas; Heat transports; High-latitudes; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Late cretaceous; Low altitudes; Maximum temperatures; Ocean-atmosphere models; Onset of convections; Paleogene; Surface temperatures; Vertical distributions; Atmospheric movements; Climatology; Clouds; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat transfer; Ocean engineering; Oceanography; Sea ice; Seawater; Sun; Sodium compounds; atmospheric modeling; carbon dioxide; cloud microphysics; concentration (composition); convective cloud; convective system; feedback mechanism; heat flux; surface temperature",,,,,,"Abbot, D.S., Tziperman, E., A high-latitude convective cloud feedback and equable climates (2008) Quart.
