In the ensuing search for new environmentally begin refrigerants, carbon dioxide has been considered due to its excellent thermophysical properties. This paper gives a review of the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of supercritical carbon dioxide in tube flow. This information is necessary for designing the gas cooler of a carbon dioxide refrigeration system. A comparison of the different heat transfer correlations applicable to cooling of supercritical carbon dioxide has also been made.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Flow of fluids; Pressure drop; Refrigerants; Refrigerating machinery; Tubes (components); Gas cooler; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Thermophysical properties; Heat transfer",,,,,,,"Pitla, Srinivas S.; Purdue Univ, West Lafayette, United States",,,"ASHRAE, Atlanta, GA, United States","Proceedings of the 1999 ASHRAE Winter Meeting","23 January 1999 through 27 January 1999","Chicago, IL, USA",55431,00012505,,ASHTA,,"English","ASHRAE Trans",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032655573
