A key missing element from models of climatic change impacts on animals is the buffering influence of behavioral thermoregulation. Here, we show how behavioral and mass/energy balance models can be combined with spatial data on climate, topography, and vegetation to predict impacts of increased air temperature on thermoregulating ectotherms such as reptiles and insects (a large portion of global biodiversity). We show that for most ""cold-blooded"" terrestrial animals, the primary thermal challenge is not to attain high body temperatures (although this is important in temperate environments) but to stay cool (particularly in tropical and desert areas, where ectotherm biodiversity is greatest). The impact of climate warming on thermoregulating ectotherms will depend critically on how changes in vegetation cover alter the availability of shade as well as the animals' capacities to alter their seasonal timing of activity and reproduction. Warmer environments also may increase maintenance energy costs while simultaneously constraining activity time, putting pressure on mass and energy budgets. Energy- and mass-balance models provide a general method to integrate the complexity of these direct interactions between organisms and climate into spatial predictions of the impact of climate change on biodiversity. This methodology allows quantitative organism- and habitat-specific assessments of climate change impacts.","Australia; Biophysical model; Climate change; GIS; Terrestrial ectotherm","animal behavior; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; biodiversity; body temperature; climate change; cold climate; controlled study; desert; energy balance; glacial mass balance; habitat structure; insect; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reptile; thermoregulation; topography; tropics; vegetation; Air; Animals; Australia; Behavior, Animal; Body Temperature Regulation; Circadian Rhythm; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Lizards; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Animalia; Hexapoda; Reptilia",,,,,,"Lovejoy, T.E., Hannah, L., (2006) Climate Change and Biodiversity, , Yale Univ Press, New Haven, CT; Parmesan, C., Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change (2006) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 37, pp. 637-669; Thomas, C.D., Extinction risk from climate change (2004) Nature, 427, pp. 145-148; Schwartz, M.W., Iverson, L.R., Prasad, A.M., Matthews, S.N., O'Connor, R.J., Predicting extinctions as a result of climate change (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 1611-1615; Araújo, M.B., Thuiller, W., Pearson, R.G., Climate warming and the decline of amphibians and reptiles in Europe (2006) Journal of Biogeography, 33, pp. 1712-1728; Davis, A.J., Jenkinson, L.S., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Wood, S., Making mistakes when predicting shifts in species range in response to global warming (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 783-786; Kearney, M., Porter, W.P., Mapping the fundamental niche: Physiology, climate, and the distribution of a nocturnal lizard (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 3119-3131; Pearson, R.G., Dawson, T.P., Predicting the impacts of climatechangeonthe distribution of species: Are bioclimate envelope models useful?
