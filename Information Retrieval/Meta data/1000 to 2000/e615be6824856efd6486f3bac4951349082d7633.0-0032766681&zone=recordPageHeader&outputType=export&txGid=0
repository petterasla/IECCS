Among all the sources of methane emission, paddy fields form the most dominant source. An experiment was conducted with a common paddy crop (Oryza sativa var. Vishnuparag) by amending the soils with different organic manures and biofertilizers with a view to find out an inexpensive strategy to mitigate methane emission from the rice-fields. The results revealed that there was a seasonal change in the CH4 flux, registering a peak at heading stage in all treatments. The application of rice straw before flooding and the biofertilizer after flooding enhances CH4 efflux from the rice-fields significantly, while composts of cowdung and leaves did not stimulate CH4 production and, rather, decreased CH4 fluxes. As soil pH and temperature were optimum for methanogenesis, it was likely that the organic C and the redox potential mainly modulated methane production and its emission through rice plants.","Methane emission; Redox potential; Rice fields; Vishnuparag","Methane emission; Redox potential; Rice field; Vishnuparag; Climate change; Crops; Fertilizers; Manures; Methane; pH; Redox reactions; Soils; Temperature; Gas emissions; fertilizer; methane; biogenic emission; methane; paddy farming; rice; soil amendment; article; crop; manure; methanogenesis; oxidation reduction potential; rice; seasonal variation; Oryza sativa",,"methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Bachelet, D., Neue, H.-U., Methane emission from wetland rice areas of Asia (1993) Chemosphere, 26 (1-4), p. 219; Connell, W.E., Patrick W.H., Jr., Reduction of sulphate to sulphide in waterlogged soil (1969) Soil Sci.
