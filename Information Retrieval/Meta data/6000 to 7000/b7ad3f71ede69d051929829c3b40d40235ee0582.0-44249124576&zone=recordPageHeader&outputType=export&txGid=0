The extent to which changes in bird phenology reflect responses to weather conditions in the wintering or breeding areas, or during migration, however, remains to be elucidated. We analyse the relationships between the timing of spring migration of 9 species of trans-Saharan migratory birds across the Mediterranean, and thermal and precipitation anomalies in the main wintering areas south of the Sahara Desert and in North African stopover areas. Median migration dates were collected on the island of Capri (southern Italy) by standardized mist-netting during 1981 to 2004. High temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa (Sahel and Gulf of Guinea) prior to northward migration (February and March) were associated with advanced migration. Moreover, birds migrated earlier when winter rainfall in North Africa was more abundant. The relationships between relevant meteorological variables and timing of migration were remarkably consistent among species, suggesting a coherent response to the same extrinsic stimuli. All these results were obtained while statistically controlling for the long-term trend towards the earlier timing of spring migration across the Mediterranean that has been documented in previous analyses of the same dataset, a trend that was confirmed by the present analyses. In conclusion, our results suggest that thermal conditions in the wintering quarters, as well as rainfall in North African stopover areas, can influence interannual variation in migration phenology of trans-Saharan migratory birds, although the ecological mechanisms that causally link meteorological conditions to the timing of migration remain a matter of speculation. © Inter-Research 2007.","Arrival date; Long-distance migration; Mediterranean; Sahel; Weather","Atmospheric temperature; Birds; Climate change; Ecology; Population dynamics; Rain; annual variation; arrival date; bird; climate change; climate effect; migratory species; Northern Hemisphere; phenology; rainfall; temperature anomaly; Africa; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sub-Saharan Africa; Aves",,,,,,"Ahola, M., Laaksonen, T., Sippola, K., Eeva, T., Rainio, K., Lehikoinen, E., Variation in climate warming along the migration route uncouples arrival and breeding dates (2004) Glob Change Biol, 10, pp. 1610-1617; Baillie, S.R., Peach, W.J., Population limitation in Palaearctic-African migrant passerines (1992) Ibis, 134 (SUPPL.), pp. 120-132; Both, C., Comment on 'Rapid advance of spring arrival dates in long-distance migratory birds' (2007) Science, 315, pp. 598b; Both, C., Visser, M.E., Adjustment to climate change is constrained by arrival date in a long-distance migrant bird (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 296-298; Both, C., Artemyev, A.V., Blaauw, B., Cowie, R.J., and others, Large-scale geographical variation confirms that climate change causes birds to lay earlier (2004) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 271, pp. 1657-1662; Both, C., Bijlsma, R.G., Visser, M.E., Climatic effects on timing of spring migration and breeding in a long-distance migrant, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca (2005) J Avian Biol, 36, pp. 368-373; Cotton, P.A., Avian migration phenology and global climate change (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 12219-12222; Cramp, S., (1998) The complete birds of the western Palearctic, , on CD-ROM.
