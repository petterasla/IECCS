Improved cooking stoves (ICS) have been developed worldwide as an alternative household fuel burning device, as well as a climate change mitigation. A study was conducted among female Forest User Groups (FUGs) of Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh, to assess the status of ICS disseminated by the Forest Department (FD) under the Nishorgo (2009) Support Project, along with the community's biomass fuel consumption pattern. Wood consumption was highest (345kg month -1 household -1) followed by agricultural residues (60kg month -1 household -1), tree leaves (51kg month -1 household -1) and cow dung (25kg month -1 household -1). Neighbouring forests of the sanctuary was the core source for wood fuel, with little or no reduction in the extraction even after joining the FUG. Twenty-two species, both indigenous and introduced, were preferred as wood fuel. None of the respondents were found willing to use ICS although 43% owned one; either as a status symbol or to meet the conditions of the FD for membership in FUG. Seven negative features of the disseminated ICS were identified by households, which made them unwilling to use them further. Manufacturing faults may be responsible for some ICS demerits, while the FD failed to convince the community of the benefits. A proper examination of the disseminated ICS efficacy is crucial, with active involvement of community members. The Sustainable Energy Triangle Strategy (SETS) could be implemented for this purpose. Findings of the study are of immense importance in designing a strategy for the introduction of ICS into Bangladesh. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Bangladesh; biomass fuel; climate change; cooking stove; protected area","assessment method; biomass burning; cooking appliance; energy conservation; fuel; global warming; introduced species; manufacturing; protected area; species diversity; sustainable development; Bangladesh; Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary; Sylhet",,,,,,"Alam, S.M.N., Chowdhury, S.J., Begum, A., Rahman, M., Effect of improved earthen stoves: Improving health for rural communities in Bangladesh (2006) Energy Convers Manage, 10 (3), pp. 46-53; (1997) Biological Survey, , [BCAS] Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies (Bangladesh).
