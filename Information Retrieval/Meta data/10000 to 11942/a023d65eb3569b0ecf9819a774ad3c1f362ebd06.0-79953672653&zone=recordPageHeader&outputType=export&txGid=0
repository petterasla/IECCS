Denitrification, the biological conversion of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen, removes a substantial fraction of the nitrogen from aquatic ecosystems, and can therefore help to reduce eutrophication effects. However, potential responses of denitrification to warming are poorly understood. Although several studies have reported increased denitrification rates with rising temperature, the impact of temperature on denitrification seems to vary widely between systems. Methodology/Principal Findings: We explored the effects of warming on denitrification rates using microcosm experiments, field measurements and a simple model approach. Our results suggest that a three degree temperature rise will double denitrification rates. By performing experiments at fixed oxygen concentrations as well as with oxygen concentrations varying freely with temperature, we demonstrate that this strong temperature dependence of denitrification can be explained by a systematic decrease of oxygen concentrations with rising temperature. Warming decreases oxygen concentrations due to reduced solubility, and more importantly, because respiration rates rise more steeply with temperature than photosynthesis. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that denitrification rates in aquatic ecosystems are strongly temperature dependent, and that this is amplified by the temperature dependencies of photosynthesis and respiration. Our results illustrate the broader phenomenon that coupling of temperature dependent reactions may in some situations strongly alter overall effects of temperature on ecological processes. © 2011 Veraart et al.",,"dissolved oxygen; oxygen; article; cell respiration; controlled study; denitrification; freshwater environment; greenhouse effect; microcosm; nitrification; oxygen concentration; oxygen consumption; photosynthesis; primary production (biomass); steady state; temperature dependence; ecosystem; metabolism; physiology; temperature; Denitrification; Ecosystem; Oxygen; Temperature",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Vitousek, P.M., Aber, J.D., Howarth, R.W., Likens, G.E., Matson, P.A., Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle: sources and consequences (1997) Ecol Appl, 7, pp. 737-750; Seitzinger, S.P., Denitrification in freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems: Ecological and geochemical significance (1988) Limnol Oceanogr, 33, pp. 702-724; Barnard, R., Leadley, P.W., Hungate, B.A., Global change, nitrification, and denitrification: A review (2005) Global Biogeochem Cy, 19, pp. GB1007; Smith, K.A., The potential for feedback effects induced by global warming on emissions of nitrous oxide by soils (1997) Glob Change Biol, 3, pp. 327-338; Thomann, R.V., Mueller, J.A., Principles of surface water quality modeling and control (1987), New York, Harper & Row, Publishers, IncHoltan-Hartwig, L., Dörsch, P., Bakken, L.R., Low temperature control of soil denitrifying communities: kinetics of N2O production and reduction (2002) Soil Biol Biochem, 34, pp. 1797-1806; Dawson, R.N., Murphy, K.L., The temperature dependency of biological denitrification (1972) Water Res, 6, pp. 71-83; Bachand, P.A.M., Horne, A.J., Denitrification in constructed free-water surface wetlands: II.
