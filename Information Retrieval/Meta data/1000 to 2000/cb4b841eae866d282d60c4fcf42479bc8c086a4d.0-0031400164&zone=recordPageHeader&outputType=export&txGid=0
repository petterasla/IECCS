Concern for the adequacy of Delta water supplies increases with growing population and environmental maintenance needs and with the hydroclimatic uncertainty of global warming. Reconstructed or unimpaired discharges for Delta tributary areas are analyzed for trend and for changes in the seasonal regime of Delta inflows. Nonparametric tests indicate the absence of trend for annual inflows, but the low inflow months of September and October display increasing trends that are statistically significant. Additional changes in the Delta inflow regime are evident when inflow volumes are expressed relative to annual inflow. Decreasing trends in the spring fraction of annual total inflows and in the monthly fractions for April and May are statistically significant. March displays a significant increasing trend in the monthly fraction of inflow. The emerging decadal changes in monthly inflows have practical ramifications for water managers in the Delta.
