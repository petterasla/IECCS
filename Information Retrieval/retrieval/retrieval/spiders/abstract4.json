Methane emissions from ricefields are affected by climate, water regime, soil properties, and various cultural practices like irrigation and drainage, organic amendments, fertilization, and rice cultivars. Irrigated rice comprises 50% of the world-harvested rice area and contributes 70% to total rice production. Because of assured flooding during the growing period it is the primary source of methane. Rainfed rice emits less methane due to periods of droughts. Upland rice, being never flooded for a significant period of time, is not a significant source of methane. There is great potential to develop 'no regret' mitigation options that are in accordance with increasing rice production. \u00a9 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Means of evaluating and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are being sought. In this study an existing simulation model of a tropical savanna woodland grazing system was adapted to account for greenhouse gas emissions. This approach may be able to be used in identifying ways to assess and limit emissions from other rangeland, agricultural and natural ecosystems. GRASSMAN, an agricultural decision-support model, was modified to include sources, sinks and storages of greenhouse gases in the tropical and sub-tropical savanna woodlands of northern Australia. The modified model was then used to predict the changes in emissions and productivity resulting from changes in stock and burning management in a hypothetical grazing system in tropical northeastern Queensland. The sensitivity of these results to different Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) and emission definitions was then tested. Management options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the tropical grazing system investigated were highly sensitive to the GWPs used, and to the emission definition adopted. A recommendation to reduce emissions by changing burning management would be to reduce fire frequency if both direct and indirect GWPs of CO", ", CH", ", N", "O, CO and NO are used in evaluating emissions, but to increase fire frequency if only direct GWPs of CO", ", CH", " and N", "O are used. The ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from these systems by reducing stocking rates was also sensitive to the GWPs used. In heavily grazed systems, the relatively small reductions in stocking rate needed to reduce emissions significantly should also reduce the degradation of soils and vegetation, thereby improving the sustainability of these enterprises. The simulation studies indicate that it is possible to alter management to maximise beef cattle production per unit greenhouse gases or per unit methane emitted, but that this is also dependent upon the emission definition used. High ratios of liveweight gain per unit net greenhouse gas emission were found in a broadly defined band covering the entire range of stocking rates likely to be used. In contrast, high values of liveweight gain per unit 'anthropogenic' greenhouse gas emission were found only at very low stocking rates that are unlikely to be economically viable. These results suggest that policy initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tropical grazing systems should be evaluated cautiously until the GWPs have been further developed and the implications of emission definitions more rigorously determined. \u00a9 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

A global energy system model, ETSAP-TIAM, was used and a Scrap Availability Assessment Model (SAAM) was developed to analyse the relation between steel demand, recycling and the availability of scrap and their implications for steel production technology choices. Steel production using recycled materials has a continuous growth and is likely to be a major route for steel production in the long run. However, as the global average of in-use steel stock increases up to the current average stock of the industrialised economies, global steel demand keeps growing and stagnates only after 2050. Due to high steel demand levels and scarcity of scrap, more than 50% of the steel production in 2050 will still have to come from virgin materials. Hydrogen-based steel production could become a major technology option for production from virgin materials, particularly in a scenario where Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is not available.

Observed significant changes in the atmospheric circulation throughout the troposphere revealed a deeper and eastward shifted Aleutian low pressure system in the winter half year which advected warmer and moister air along the west coast of North America and into Alaska and colder air over the north Pacific. Consequently, there were increases in temperatures and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) along the west coast of North America and Alaska but decreases in SSTs over the central north Pacific, as well as changes in coastal rainfall and streamflow, and decreases in sea ice in the Bering Sea. Associated changes occurred in the surface wind stress, and, by inference, in the Sverdrup transport in the north Pacific Ocean. Changes in the monthly mean flow were accompanied by a southward shift in the storm tracks and associated synoptic eddy activity and in the surface ocean sensible and latent heat fluxes. In addition to the changes in the physical environment, the deeper Aleutian low increased the nutrient supply as seen through increases in total chlorophyll in the water column, phytoplankton and zooplankton. These changes, along with the altered ocean currents and temperatures, changed the migration patterns and increased the stock of many fish species. A north Pacific (NP) index is defined to measure the decadal variations, and the temporal variability of the index is explored on daily, annual, interannual and decadal time scales. The dominant atmosphere-ocean relation in the north Pacific is one where atmospheric changes lead SSTs by one to two months. However, strong ties are revealed with events in the tropical Pacific, with changes in tropical Pacific SSTs leading SSTs in the north Pacific by three months. Changes in the storm tracks in the north Pacific help to reinforce and maintain the anomalous circulation in the upper troposphere. A hypothesis is put forward outlining the tropical and extratropical realtionships which stresses the role of tropical forcing but with important feed-backs in the extratropics that serve to emphasize the decadal relative to interannual time scales.

In the analysis of energy intensity using Input-Output table, the evaluation of electricity has several alternatives. A method is proposed to modify the structural matrix to manipulate electricity in a unified way. The effect of fixed capital depreciation is considered, which is not counted in normal way of Input-Output analysis. The result shows that the change in considering fixed capital is not so large for energy consumption structure in Japan. Two graphic methods to analyze the structure of Input-Output table are also considered. The inverse matrix coefficient that is the total sum of production to supply unit final demand, is plotted in a special graph to analyze the structure of energy flow from petroleum to automobiles and other products. The effect of transportation sector on the energy flow is analyzed by calculating and plotting inverse matrix coefficient from modified structural matrix. This paper suggests that Input-Output table is useful for energy analysis."], "title": "Estimation of energy intensity and structure of energy consumption based on input-output table"},

They contribute to global warming. To a large extent, emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are connected with the intensification of food production. Therefore, feeding a growing world population and at the same time controlling these emissions is a great challenge. Important anthropogenic sources of biogenic methane are wet rice fields, cattle, animal waste, landfills and biomass burning. Important anthropogenic sources of biogenic nitrous oxide are land-use change, fertilizer production and use and manure application. The ultimate objective of the Framework Convention on Climate Change implies a stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. As a small first step towards achieving this objective, the Convention requires the industrialized countries to bring their anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by 2000 back to 1990 levels. It was also agreed that all parties would make national inventories of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and programmes for control (UN, 1992). In this context, in February 1993 an international workshop was held in Amersfoort in the Netherlands to discuss methods in national emission inventories for methane and nitrous oxide, and options for control (Van Amstel, 1993). A selection of the papers presented in Amersfoort that focus on agricultural sources is published in this volume. This introductory chapter gives background information on biogenic sources and sinks of methane and nitrous oxide and options for their control. The goal of the Climate Convention is described as well as the IPCC effort to develop an internationally accepted methodology for the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks. Finally, some preliminary results from country inventories are given. It is concluded that a common reporting framework and transparency of the inventories are important to obtain comparable results that can be used for complying with the requirements of the Climate Convention and for facilitating the international debate about appropriate response strategies. \u00a9 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers."], "title": "Methane and nitrous oxide emissions: an introduction"},

CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs absorb infra-red radiation and thus are greenhouse gases that can exert an additional radiative forcing that tends to warm the climate. The purpose of this paper is to describe the current understanding of the role of refrigerants in affecting climate. Increasing atmospheric concentrations of CFCs have accounted for about 24% of the direct increase in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases over the last decade. However, an observed decrease in stratospheric ozone, thought to be connected to increasing stratospheric chlorine from CFCs (and, to a lesser extent, from other man-made compounds containing chlorine and bromine), suggests a negative radiative forcing or cooling tendency over the last decade. This cooling tendency has strong latitudinal gradients, but is, when globally averaged, about comparable in magnitude and opposite in sign to the radiative forcing from CFCs over this period. On the other hand, the radiative influence on climate from the compounds being considered as replacements, because of their shorter atmospheric lifetimes, should generally be much smaller than the CFCs. However, the effects on ozone should also be much smaller from the replacement compounds and there should be less cancellation in the overall globally averaged influence on climate. \u00a9 1994."], "title": "The role of refrigerants in climate change"},

The solar energy reaching the surface is modified by the aerosols in the atmosphere, however, and that means primarily aerosols of volcanic origin. The climatic history of the Earth is divided up into episodes with abrupt beginnings and ends. Rapid changes from one climatic state to another are normal. The fluctuations within this century do not appear to be unusual in any respect. To the Author's knowledge there is no evidence that past climatic changes, including those of the last decades, are related to changes in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - except perhaps for warmer nights in the North American mid-west. It is not possible to simulate past climates using carbon dioxide content as the main variable, but it is possible to do so using calculated solar radiation as modified by volcanic aerosols. This strongly suggests that forecasts of the climatic future based on carbon dioxide increases are suspect. Computerized models of the climate that can simulate decadal and century-long variations of climate as well as variations on the millennium scale, suggest that the climate will not warm dramatically in the next fifty years, but will, rather soon after that, begin a rather rapid change towards the next glacial climate. Changes in our global array of cultures, sufficient to affect the global climate in a way which we perceive as beneficial, probably are not possible within centuries without massive physical conflict. There are both winners and losers when the climate changes in a non-uniform pattern, as it always does. It is a well-known fact that a global change of 0.5\u00b0C in mean temperature, such as has happened in recent years, might produce some regions of 10\u00b0C change in either direction and some regions with no change at all, and additionally an array of rainfall changes of various magnitudes. Russians would welcome warming of their climate! The problems with attempting to modify the global climate in a particular direction are enormous and would be incredibly costly. This is compounded by our not knowing what the climate would do without intervention. Only one thing is truly clear, and it is that the present knowledge of the climatic effect of changing carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is totally inadequate as a basis for initiating any global attempt to change the climate. The indicated action would appear to be to engage in some high- quality climatic research based on sound science before taking global risks greater than those that might arise from the putative 'global warming'."], "title": "Simulating past and forecasting future climates"},

Since constructions in marine environments mostly have an important social function with a high economic impact, fast repair of the cracks is desirable. However, repair costs are large and in some cases repair is impossible due to inaccessibility. A possible solution is self-healing by means of encapsulated polyurethane which has the ability to induce recovery without external intervention. From the test results it seems that chloride penetration increases when the crack width increases. Furthermore, chloride penetration at the crack tip, for crack widths between 100 \u03bcm and 300 \u03bcm, is higher than from the surface. Preliminary tests by using manual crack healing show that polyurethane is able to seal the cracks and prevent chlorides to penetrate along the crack path in 83% of the cases for initial crack widths of 100 \u03bcm and in 67% of the cases for initial crack widths of 300 \u03bcm. Based on these findings, tests were performed with autonomous crack healing by means of encapsulated polyurethane. Autonomous healing is able to seal crack widths of 100 \u03bcm and 300 \u03bcm for chloride penetration in 67% and 33% of the cases, respectively. So, autonomous crack healing by means of encapsulated polyurethane has the potential to improve durability of cementitious materials and increase the service life of constructions in chloride containing environments.

Agricultural crops, grown specifically for use as a fuel source, might play an important role in reducing our consumption of fossil fuel sources through substitution. However, in order to fully qualify as a \"beneficial crop\" it must be clearly shown that production entails a net benefit in terms of energy output to energy input i.e.; it has a positive energy balance. This paper considers the difficulties in assessing both carbon and energy budgeting. It describes a recently developed computer model which attempts to define the energy and carbon inputs and outputs of the leading UK energy crop, that is of short rotation coppice (SRC). Preliminary results show that SRC, when displacing fossil fuel, has a very positive energy yield with the added benefit of carbon saving in terms of offset emissions. The computer model takes account of direct and indirect energy and carbon inputs to the crop, allowing the model user to determine the sensitivity of individual cropping operations including establishment, fencing, harvesting operations, rotation and cutting cycle variations, the impact of field size, transport distance from the farm to the point of utilisation, the energy cost of storage and drying. Each management decision influences the final energy or carbon ratio of the SRC crop. Such complexity makes a definitive statement on the energy/carbon ratio for crop production difficult, however if a standard management system is adopted (as described later) the energy ratio of growing SRC for fuel may be assigned. In the case examined here a ratio of 30 : 1 (energy units produced : used) is reported. However, this ratio is sensitive to variation in crop yield and management efficiency and so, although the ratio is positive, this should not encourage a wasteful attitude to crop management systems. In terms of carbon balances, the most important consideration is the substitution value of the material in relation to fossil fuels. In this paper, figures presented refer to wood substituted for coal use and pertain to a field area of 1 hectare (ha). If field size is increased up to 3ha, then the energy and carbon ratios improve by approximately 15 %. \u00a9 1993."], "title": "The carbon and energy budgets of energy crops"},

All four GCM scenarios show similar trends in vegetation shifts and in areas that remain stable, although the UKMO scenario predicts greater warming than the others. Climate change maps produced by all four GCM scenarios show good agreement with the current climate vegetation map for the globe as a whole, although over half of the vegetation classes show only poor to fair agreement.

Thus, quite a number of recent studies have focused on detecting the \"global sea level rise\" or even an acceleration of this trend. A brief review of these studies is presented, showing, however, that the results are not conclusive, though most of the studies have been based on a single global data set of coastal tide gauge data provided by the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). A detailed discussion of a thoroughly revised subset reveals that the PSMSL data set suffers from three severe limitations: (1) the geographical distribution of reliable tide gauge stations is rather uneven with pronounced concentrations in some areas of the northern hemisphere (Europe, North America, Japan), and much fewer stations on the southern hemisphere where particularly few stations are located in Africa and in Antarctica; (2) the number of stations recording simultaneously at any time is far less than the total number of stations with the maximum within the interval between 1958 and 1988; (3) the number of long records is extremely small and almost all of them originate from a few regions of the northern hemisphere. The sensitivity of the median of the local trends to these temporal and spatial limitations is discussed by restricting the data set in both the spatial and temporal distribution. It is shown that the data base is insufficient for determining an integral value of the global rise in relative sea level. The effect of polar motion on sea level is modelled and it turns out to be locally of the order of 0.5 mm/yr, affecting regional trends to an order of 0.1 mm/yr. Thus, this effect can be neglected on time scale of decades to a hundred years. Though the data set is insufficient for determining an integral sea level rise, the data, nevertheless, are providing information concerning regional trends in sea level and even temporal variations in these regional patterns. Thus, the most comprehensive subset of the data reveals the existence of a significant interdecadal east-west fluctuation of the oceans possibly indicating some kind of teleconnection. Besides the limitations of the data set, the physical nature of the long term changes in relative sea level, which by no means are globally uniform, might render any globally averaged value of relative sea level rise useless for detecting climatic impacts or validating climate models. \u00a9 1993."], "title": "Estimations of a global sea level trend: limitations from the structure of the PSMSL global sea level data set"},

The central Asian records along with that from Quelccaya provide strong evidence of recent and rapid warming in the tropics and subtropics. For the Dunde Ice Cap, where a long paleoclimatic record is available, the warming in this century appears to be unprecedented in the Holocene. These tropical and subtropical records contrast sharply with those from polar cores which show little evidence of a recent warming. These data suggest that either the recent warming is a middle and lower latitude phenomenon or that these high altitude tropical and subtropical glaciers may be more sensitive to climate changes than the massive polar ice sheets. Regardless, the current rapid disintegration of many tropical and subtropical glaciers may result in the permanent loss of numerous unique archives. \u00a9 1993."], "title": "\"Recent warming\": ice core evidence from tropical ice cores with emphasis on Central Asia"},

We observe in both continents a well-developed dense forest at 30,000 and 9000 yr B.P. The succession of vegetation types during the Late Quaternary appeared strongly related to the regional conditions: (1) the dense forest was more or less degraded depending on the regions during the last full glacial period (20,000-15,000 yr B.P.); (2) a slow increase of tree elements is evidenced in some areas during the Late Glacial (15,000-10,000 yr B.P.), whereas short-term fluctuations occurred in central Brazil during the same time; (3) a strong regression of the forest during the middle Holocene (6000-5000 yr B.P.), in the southern tropical zone of South America, was in opposition to a full forest development in Africa. In both continents two main features characterize the tropical forest evolution: (1) Montane elements developed in the lowlands during the last glacial period and in some southern or northern regions during the early Holocene; and (2) the climate seasonality was enhanced in several regions since 8500-7500 yr B.P. For a tentative explanation, we relate the cold or cool climate, inferred by palaeoecological evidences in the glacial period and glacial-interglacial transition, to polar air-masses reaching more frequently the tropical zone. This interpretation explains the apparent contradiction between the markedly low temperature of the continental lowlands opposed: (1) at 18,000 yr B.P., to the 1-2\u00b0C lower Sea Surface Temperature of tropical oceans and (2) to the global warming during the late glacial. During the middle and Late Holocene, climate evolution was mainly influenced by the latitudinal shift of the ITCZ positions in July and January and, in South America, by short-term changes of the zonal atmospheric circulation. \u00a9 1993."], "title": "Tropical forest changes during the late quaternary in African and South American lowlands"},

One such effort, the Vision 2020 plan in the Seattle region, is described in this paper. The modeling tools utilized widely available travel and land-use models, applied interactively. A wide range of variables, consisting of transportation facility investments, demand management measures and land-use controls, were grouped into identifiable long-term alternatives. The analysis suggested some ambiguity in the ability to model the processes, particularly within a highly political planning program, and indicated rather modest effects of land-use changes on reducing urban travel over 20 to 30 years. Land use and demand management were most effective when supported by significant investment in facilities, including transit. Although attempting to alter urban spatial structure may not be the most cost-effective place to seek reductions in vehicular emissions over this period of time, planning programs like Seattle's may be an opportunity to mold less travel-dependent urban regions for the next century. \u00a9 1993."], "title": "Linked simulation of land use and transportation systems: Developments and experience in the Puget sound region"},

Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has established a methodology for assessment of GHG emissions from agriculture, the forecasting options are limited, especially when policies and their interaction with the agricultural system are tested. Therefore, an advanced tool, a system dynamics model, was developed that enables assessment of effects various decisions and measures have on agricultural GHG emissions. The model is based on the IPCC guidelines and includes the main elements of an agricultural system, i.e. land management, livestock farming, soil fertilization and crop production, as well as feedback mechanisms between the elements. The case of Latvia is selected for simulations, as agriculture generates 22% of the total anthropogenic GHG emissions in the country. The results demonstrate that there are very limited options for GHG mitigation in the agricultural sector. Thereby, reaching the non-ETS GHG emission targets will be very challenging for Latvia, as the level of agricultural GHG emissions will be exceeded considerably above the target levels. Thus, other non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions drastically to \"neutralize\" the agricultural sector's emissions for reaching the EU's common ambition to move towards low-carbon economy. The developed model may serve as a decision support tool for impact assessment of various measures and decisions on the agricultural system's GHG emissions. Although the model is applied to the case of Latvia, the elements and structure of the model developed are similar to agricultural systems in many countries. By changing numeric values of certain parameters, the model can be applied to analyze decisions and measures in other countries. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V."], "title": "Searching for solutions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by agricultural policy decisions - Application of system dynamics modeling for the case of Latvia"},

Assuming climate variability with a time scale of a decade or less, climate sensitivity is estimated to be significantly greater than zero, but also significantly lower than that predicted by GCM's. Climate variability with a century time scale is consistent with both the recent temperature record and the pre-instrumental record for the last millenium; if this type of variability is assumed, the estimate of climate sensitivity has a confidence band wide enough to encompass both zero and typical values obtained by GCM's.

Since observed climate anomaly patterns often are computed as time-averaged differences between two periods, climate-change signals in the coupled model are defined using differences of various averaging intervals between the transient and control integrations. Annual mean surface air temperature differences for several regions show that the Northern Hemisphere warms faster than the Southern Hemisphere and that land areas warm faster than ocean. The high northern latitudes outside the North Atlantic contribute most to global warming but also exhibit great variability, while the high southern latitudes contribute the least. The equatorial tropics warm more slowly than the subtropics due to strong upwelling and mixing in the ocean.

By chance, one particular northern winter five-year average geographical difference pattern in the Northern Hemisphere from the coupled model resembles the recent observed pattern of surface temperature and sea-level pressure anomalies. This pattern is not consistent from one five-year period to the next in any season in the model. However, multidecadal averages in the coupled model show that the North Atlantic warms less than the rest of the high northern latitudes, and recent observations may be a manifestation of this phenomenon.

Thaw-freeze and root-freeze events in winter and early spring were key factors in triggering (and synchronizing) severe episodes of dieback. Once trees were injured by freezing, forest dieback correlated significantly with heat and drought stress. Freezing (but not drought) stresses in Northern Hardwoods correlated significantly (r = 0.70, p < 0.001) with increasing global mean annual temperatures and low values of the Pacific tropical Southern Oscillation Index. Major diebacks did not occur early in the century at a time of notable freezing stress. Prior to 1940, the Northern Hardwoods consisted of relatively young populations of trees regrowing following extensive cutting and forest burning in the late 19th century (1860-1890). It appears that forest maturation is the key factor preconditioning trees to climatic injury, and dieback. A simple projection of climate and forest maturation ages suggested the recurrence of major dieback episodes on white/yellow birch, sugar maple and red spruce in the latter half of the 21st century (2045-2085)."], "title": "The role of climate variability and global warming in the dieback in Northern Hardwoods"},

After the mathematical description of the method, an example of the analysis for model data on which some trends are superimposed (given) at any stations was shown for an explanation of the method. This example not only clarified the performance (impact, weight) of the superimposed trend in the trend for each principal component score (Z-score) but also showed how all the superimposed trends were separated from the model data by this method.

A total rise of up to 1 m is possible by the year 2100 (relative to 1990). To deal with this change, coastal managers require site-specific information on relative (i.e., local) changes in sea level to determine what might be threatened. Therefore as a first step, global sea-level rise scenarios need to be transformed into relative sea-level change scenarios which take account of local and regional factors, such as vertical land movements, in addition to global changes. Even present rates of relative sealevel rise have important long-term implications for coastal management - projecting existing trends predicts a relative sea-level rise from 1990 to 2100 of up to 0.4 m and 1.15 m for the Mid-Atlantic Region and Louisiana, respectively. Ignoring sea-level rise will lead to unwise decisions and increasing hazard with time. This article adapts the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global scenarios for sea-level rise (Warrick et al., 1996) to three relative sea-level rise scenarios for the contiguous United States. These scenarios cover the period 1990 to 2100 and provide a basis to assess possible proactive measures for sea-level rise. However, they are subject to the same uncertainties as the global scenarios as most of the sea-level rise will occur decades into the future. When considering what should be done now in response to future sea-level rise, given these large uncertainties, it is best to identify (1) low-cost, no regret responses which would maintain or enhance the choices available to tomorrow's coastal managers; and (2) sectors where reactive adaptation would have particularly high costs and where allowance for future sea-level rise can be considered a worthwhile \"insurance policy.\" Sea-level rise will impact an evolving coastal landscape which already is experiencing a range of other pressures.

In the Philippines, a preliminary assessment of the vulnerability of water resources to climate change and variability was undertaken.

Climate change scenarios developed from results from three general circulation models and incremental changes were used. The results showed that changes in temperature and rainfall could affect runoff either positively or negatively. Using the temperature and rainfall changes from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model there was a 32% increase in runoff, and with the Canadian Climate Centre Model, there was a 15% decrease in runoff. Under a climate scenario generated by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office model, runoff is estimated to increase by 5%.

This produces net benefits for recycling, per tonne of material, of \u00a31769 for aluminium, \u00a3238 for steel, \u00a3226 for paper and \u00a3188 for glass, and net costs of \u00a32.57 for high density polyethylene (HDPE), \u00a34.10 for poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) and \u00a37.28 for poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET). It is concluded that lifecycle evaluation, the combination of lifecycle assessment and economic valuation, can be applied to a variety of waste management issues such as the appraisal of alternative methods of collection for recycling or an examination of the UK waste management hierarchy. This technique allows impacts to be expressed in homogenous units, and the inclusion of social and environmental impacts that would not normally be-addressed within a lifecycle assessment. The approach would also facilitate the evaluation of environmental and social effects at a local level, which are particularly crucial to the success of community recycling schemes. Lifecycle evaluation could provide a powerful tool to aid the development of sustainable waste management and recycling policy."], "title": "Lifecycle assessment and economic evaluation of recycling: A case study"},

These coupled models show that the heat input by the model atmosphere to the ocean in such an event could be quite non-uniform in different areas of the ocean. One of the most significant effects predicted by some of the models is a weakening of the thermohaline circulation, which normally transports heat poleward. Since the greatest heat input from enhanced greenhouse warming is in the higher latitudes, a weakening of the poleward heat transport effectively redistributes the heat anomaly and the associated sea level rise to lower latitudes. In this study, the mechanism of ocean circulation spindown and heat redistribution was studied in the context of a much simpler, linearized shallow water model. Although the model is much simpler than the three-dimensional ocean circulation models used in the coupled model experiments, and neglects several important physical effects, it has a nearly 10-fold increase in horizontal resolution and clearer dynamical interpretations. The results indicated that advanced signals of sea level rise propagated rapidly through the action of Kelvin and Rossby waves, but the full adjustment toward a more uniform sea level rise took place much more slowly. Long time scales were required to redistribute mass through narrow currents trapped along coasts and the equatorial wave guide. For realistic greenhouse warming, the model showed why the sea level rise due to ocean heating could be far from uniform over the globe and hence difficult to estimate from coastal tide gauge stations."], "title": "Redistribution of sea level rise associated with enhanced greenhouse warming: A simple model study"},

We have reconstructed late Paleocene surficial boundary conditions and modeled atmospheric conditions using the Goddard Institute for Space Studies general circulation model version II (GISS GCM II). These experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that warm saline deep water formed during the late Paleocene and to understand atmospheric circulation near the beginning of a period of global warming. The warming is attributed primarily to increased sea surface temperatures at high latitudes. The sensitivity of the climate to ocean temperature was tested using two sea surface temperature distributions, each delimited latitudinally by oxygen isotope values, but with different east-west gradients. The simulations discussed here contain several features unique among warm climate experiments. The first experiment (P-1) used latitudinally constant (zonal) sea surface temperatures. The zonally distributed sea surface temperatures strengthen the general circulation of the atmosphere. In particular, Hadley Cell circulation is intensified, leading to extremes of precipitation in the equatorial region and extreme evaporation across subtropical oceans. The unusual results prompted a second experiment with modern east-west sea surface temperature gradients superimposed and referred to as P-Gradient (P-Grad). The east-west gradients in the sea surface temperature field exert a strong influence on the general atmospheric circulation, but the extreme zonality prevails. Under extreme zonal conditions it is possible to create a model where evaporation is in excess of precipitation by as much as 3 mm/day. If this occurred in restricted areas in a generally warmer ocean, such as the late Paleocene eastern Tethys Ocean and parts of the South Atlantic Ocean, it should be possible to create very saline water, which could become a component in warm saline deep water formation."], "title": "Implications for the creation of warm saline deep water: Late Paleocene reconstructions and global climate model simulations"},

Tourism is the most important economic sector in the coastal zone and contributes about 10% of the government revenue. Fisheries and agriculture are also important coastal industries.

The existence of trends has been investigated by calculating correlation against years and the statistical significance of the regression lines has been examined at the 5% probability level (p<0.05). A consistent trend in the earlier commencement of the flowering season is observed in all cases, as well as an earlier incidence of peak days. A marked trend to an earlier end of the season was also found in the majority of cases. In most cases, the length of the season showed a trend towards prolongation although this was not significant. Both the peak values and the annual totals exhibit clear trends towards higher values. Since both the start of the season and peak days are primarily temperature-dependant, the clear trends towards an earlier start and peak day in practically all the pollen types and sites examined supports the theory of global warming or, at least, a temporary rise in air temperature over the seasons covered by this investigation. The same conclusion can be drawn from the fact, that most of the trends of pollen frequency show an increase in the number of airborne pollen grains.

Distributions of species were then predicted for points on a 5 km grid across New Zealand.

Inclusion of the 'proximity' variable in the regressions also substantially improved predictions of Nothofagus distribution. Predictions for other species were improved by incorporating a term representing interaction with the patchily distributed but strongly dominant Nothofagus species. Preliminary results from a cluster analysis of the combined predictions for all species indicate that the model successfully reconstructs the existing pattern of New Zealand's indigenous forests.

However, these negative net cloud radiation feedbacks consist of quite different shortwave and longwave components between a scheme with interactive cloud radiative properties and several schemes with specified cloud water paths. An increase in cloud water content in the warmer climate leads to optically thicker middle- and low-level clouds and in turn negative shortwave feedbacks for the interactive radiative scheme, while a decrease in cloud amount leads to a positive shortwave feedback for the other schemes. For the longwave feedbacks, a decrease in high effective cloudiness for the schemes without interactive radiative properties leads to a negative feedback, while no distinct changes in effective high cloudiness and the resulting feedback are exhibited for the scheme with interactive radiative properties. The resulting magnitude of negative net cloud radiation feed-back is largest for the scheme with interactive radiative properties.

Northern Ireland. Submerged and buried peat beds have yielded early Holocene pollen assemblages and 14C dates that demonstrate a low stand of relative sea-level (RSL) at this time. Peat formation was terminated by the deposition of sands and diatomaceous muds, reflecting RSL rise as a result of both eustatic controls and a declining level of isostatic recovery. Holocene maximum RSL occurred at c. 6000 years BP and reached +2 to +3 m OD (Belfast). A gravel barrier developed at the estuary mouth and provided the anchor point for later aeolian dune development. Along the adjacent coast, basalt shore platforms were either formed or modified, having been within the range of effective wave erosion since the early Holocene. Relative sea-level then fell rapidly. By c. 5500 years BP, aeolian dunes had formed below OD at one site within the estuary. By c. 4000 years BP, the primary elements of the geomorphology of the Bann estuary were in place. Since that time, several phases of aeolian dune and sand sheet development are apparent from the occurrence of buried soils and archaeological materials, but the primary mechanisms controlling dune stability/instability phases are not known with certainty. Periods of temporary supra-elevated water levels, probably resulting from storm conditions, have also been recognized in the coastal sedimentary record; interbedded peat and silty sand with rounded clasts forms part of a terrace sequence at +6 to +8 m OD. Radiocarbon dates suggest that several such events occurred between c. 2300 and 1700 years BP, as peat was accumulating. Recent changes include the construction of estuary mouth training walls and river dredging. Resulting from these activities, aeolian dunes have extended their area, and increased wave erosion within the estuary has been recorded.

Based on the radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetimes, halocarbon global warming potentials (HGWPs) were evaluated for the replacement compounds. Most of the HGWP values were smaller than 0.1 owing to their shorter lifetimes, and the results indicate that these compounds could be valid candidates as replacements for currently used CFCs from the point of view of HGWP.The spectral cooling rate profiles were calculated for the replacement compounds in order to study the vertical structure of their radiative effects. It was found that overlapping of the absorption bands of a compound with those of ozone causes a significant cooling in the stratosphere, even if the compound does not exist in the stratosphere. This cooling does not directly relate to the HGWP value and the cooling rate profile in the troposphere. Therefore, it can be said that the vertical structure of the radiative effects caused by the compounds should be taken into consideration as well as HGWP or GWP values when we assess the environmental effects due to replacement compounds. In this study, one parameter, defined as the ratio of the cooling rate at 30km and the tropopause, was proposed as a measure of the cooling in the stratosphere.Spectral-resolution dependency of the calculated radiative effects was also studied.

Areas with low tidal range, such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico, are especially vulnerable to rising water levels because the elevational growth range of coastal vegetation is related to tide range. Reduction of suspended sediments in rivers and prevention of wetland flooding by river dikes and impoundments have reduced sediment input to Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico deltaic wetlands. This sediment deficit will become more important with an acceleration in sea-level rise from global warming. Most sediment input occurs during strong pulsing events such as river floods and storms, and management policies and decisions are especially designed to protect against such events. Management approaches must be reoriented to take advantage of pulsing events to nourish marsh surfaces with sediments.

Previously proposed international policy instruments, such as country by country targets, carbon taxes, and tradable permits, face major difficulties as stand alone proposals. The key element of the regime proposed here is to combine annual tradable permits which are allocated based on population in a fixed year with a small carbon tax ($5-10/tonne) on emissions in excess of permits. Both permits and carbon taxes are applied to national level governments, which in turn would use whatever mix of policies desired to reduce national emissions. It is suggested that the initial number of permits correspond to total global emissions in the base year; over time, the number of permits could be reduced and the tax rate increased if improved scientific knowledge so dictates. By allocating permits based on population the equity concerns of developing countries are addressed, while taxing emissions in excess of permit holdings removes the rigidity of a quota system and limits resource transfers by effectively capping the permit trading price, which is a major concern of industrialized countries. To accommodate the difficulties of countries which have not yet achieved the demographic transition, the permit allocation scheme could be subject to a one-time adjustment after 10-15 years based on some weighting of the initial and then-current populations. The proposed scheme is based on the premise that there is a large potential for reducing emissions in developed countries or limiting emission increases in developing countries, and the intention is to create competition between national level governments in implementing cost-effective emission reduction. \u00a9 1995."], "title": "Creating a global warming implementation regime"},

Another important effect of higher winter-temperatures at Birkenes, is that stronger and more frequent seasalt episodes seem to occur. This may enhance the negative effects to aquatic organisms, because the most extreme concentrations of acute toxic Al-forms in streamwater are related to seasalt episodes during warm winters, when the precipitation comes as rain and thus leaves the catchment relatively fast through the uppermost soil layers.

These amenities include trout, wildlife diversity, visual aesthetics, soil stability, deer populations, elk populations, and water yield.

The data were analysed to estimate daily methane production (DMP; g/day) and derived methane yield (MY; g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)). A one-compartment dose model of spot emission rate v. time since the preceding meal was compared with the models of Wood (1967) and Dijkstra et al. (1997) and the average of spot measures. Fitted values for DMP were calculated from the area under the curves. Two methods of relating methane and feed intakes were then studied: the classical calculation of MY as DMP/DMI (kg/day); and a novel method of estimating DMP from time and size of preceding meals using either the data for only the two meals preceding a spot measurement, or all meals for 3 days prior. Two approaches were also used to estimate DMP from spot measurements: fitting of splines on a \u2018per-animal per-day\u2019 basis and an alternate approach of modelling DMP after each feed event by least squares (using Solver), summing (for each animal) the contributions from each feed event by best-fitting a one-compartment model. Time since the preceding meal was of limited value in estimating DMP. Even when the meal sizes and time intervals between a spot measurement and all feeding events in the previous 72 h were assessed, only 16.9% of the variance in spot emission rate measured by GEM was explained by this feeding information. While using the preceding meal alone gave a biased (underestimate) of DMP, allowing for a longer feed history removed this bias. A power analysis taking into account the sources of variation in DMP indicated that to obtain an estimate of DMP with a 95% confidence interval within 5% of the observed 64 days mean of spot measures would require 40 animals measured over 45 days (two spot measurements per day) or 30 animals measured over 55 days. These numbers suggest that spot measurements could be made in association with feed efficiency tests made over 70 days.

The purpose of this work, which focuses on a traditional, semi-arid, cattle-cereal crop production area in the Central Pampas of Argentina, was to study structural and functional changes in this agroecosystem in response to the measured climate variability over a 30 year period, 1960-1990. Using long-term data, correlation analysis was used to estimate the degree of association between changes in the land use pattern on the one hand, and changes in rainfall, grain price and crop yield on the other hand. Crop yield was the result of an interaction between climatic and technological factors. The analysis also linked climate variability with key agroecological factors such as hydrology, energy flow, and soil nitrogen balance. The results showed that changes in land use were highly correlated with the yield of crops, less correlated with rainfall, and poorly associated with crop grain prices. A positive correlation between the annual rainfall and the relative increase of the crop area was found for all districts analyzed. This change could largely explain the increased energy flow as well as nitrogen loss in the agroecosystem studied. Consequently, land use strategies should be considered with caution, especially during favorable climatic period in semi-arid environments.

Will the amount of C in this pool increase or decrease with global warming? The future trend in amounts of soil organic C will depend on the relative temperature sensitivities of net primary productivity and soil organic matter decomposition rate. Equations for the temperature dependence of net primary productivity have been widely used, but the temperature dependence of decomposition rate is less clear. The literature was surveyed to obtain the temperature dependencies of soil respiration and N dynamics reported in different studies. Only laboratory-based measurements were used to avoid confounding effects with differences in litter input rates, litter quality, soil moisture or other environmental factors. A considerable range of values has been reported, with the greatest relative sensitivity of decomposition processes to temperature having been observed at low temperatures. A relationship fitted to the literature data indicated that the rate of decomposition increases with temperature at 0\u00b0C with a Q", " of almost 8. The temperature sensitivity of organic matter decomposition decreases with increasing temperature, indicated by the Q", " decreasing with temperature to be about 4.5 at 10\u00b0C and 2.5 at 20\u00b0C. At low temperatures, the temperature sensitivity of decomposition was consequently much greater than the temperature sensitivity of net primary productivity, whereas the temperature sensitivities became more similar at higher temperatures. The much higher temperature sensitivity of decomposition than for net primary productivity has important implications for the store of soil organic C in the soil. The data suggest that a 1\u00b0C increase in temperature could ultimately lead to a loss of over 10% of soil organic C in regions of the world with an annual mean temperature of 5\u00b0C, whereas the same temperature increase would lead to a loss of only 3% of soil organic C for a soil at 30\u00b0C. These differences are even greater in absolute amounts as cooler soils contain greater amounts of soil organic C.

Results have indicated that the new propellants are extremely benign and have an equal or better safety profile than the CFCS they are meant to replace. With the safety of the new propellants becoming more evident with time, new formulations of existing aerosol drugs are being developed. This testing includes stand-alone safety evaluations as well as studies of the drug in new propellant formulations directly compared to current CFC formulations. Comparison studies have shown that the safety profile of the new formulations is not different from that of the CFC formulations. In summary, the availability and desirability of the use of CFCs in MDIs is limited. Fortunately several alternative propellants to the CFCs are approaching development finalization.

Here we outline and discuss changes in the composition and diversity of floras and faunas during this period, which includes the recovery of terrestrial ecosystems from the K/T boundary extinctions, and later, during the Paleocene-Eocene transition, the greatest global warming of the Cenozoic. Floral diversity has been studied at three levels of spatial resolution: sub-local (at individual collecting sites), local (along a single bed or stratigraphic horizon), and basin-wide (regional). Sub-local diversity shows a moderate increase from the early to late Paleocene, followed by a decrease across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, then an increase into the later early Eocene. Local heterogeneity was lower in Paleocene backswamp floras, although distinct groups of species dominated in different local fluvial settings such as backswamps and alluvial ridges. Heterogeneity of backswamp forests increased by about 65% from the early to late Wasatchian (early Eocene). The number of plant species inferred from the Bighorn Basin dataset rose gradually from the Puercan to an early Clarkforkian peak of about 40 species, declined sharply to about 25 species by the Clarkforkian/Wasatchian boundary, then rose through the Wasatchian to about 50 species. A regional analysis of mammalian genera shows high turnover and a rapidly increasing number of genera within a million years of the K/T boundary (10-50 genera), a slight decline to 40 genera by the early Clarkforkian, then an increase from 40 to 75 genera by the late Wasatchian. Our analyses found no major extinctions in mammals during the Paleocene and early Eocene in the Bighorn Basin, but a one-third decrease in the number of plant species at about the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. Rates of taxonomic turnover were much higher for mammals than plants. The diversity trends for plants and mammals show little congruence, implying that the two groups responded in a very different manner to post K/T extinction opportunities.

Results derived from enhanced-greenhouse experiments using global climate models (GCMs) are shown to be consistent with these physical and empirical arguments. Detailed analysis of output from three GCMs indicates the possibility of substantial increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme daily precipitation, with amplification of the effect as the return period increases. Moreover, return period analyses for locations in Australia, Europe, India, China and the USA indicate that the results are global in scope. Subsequent discussion of the limitations of GCMs for this sort of analysis highlights the need for caution when interpreting the precipitation results presented here. However, the consistency between physically-based expectations, empirical observations, and GCM results is considered sufficient for the GCM results to be taken seriously, at least in a qualitative sense, especially considering that the alternative seems to be reliance by planners on the fundamentally flawed concept of a stationary climate. \u00a9 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers."], "title": "Potential impacts of global warming on the frequency and magnitude of heavy precipitation"},

Another systematic uncertainty in GWPs is the assumption of an equilibrium atmosphere (one in which the concentration of trace gases remains constant) versus a disequilibrium atmosphere (one in which the concentration of trace gases varies with time). The latter gives GWPs that are 19 to 32% greater than the former for a 100 year time horizons, depending upon the carbon dioxide emission scenario chosen.

The historical development of greenhouse gas forcing from the onset of industrialization until the present has therefore been neglected. Studies with simplified models have shown that this \"cold start\" error leads to a serious underestimation of the anthropogenic global warming. In the present study, a 150-year integration has been carried out with a global coupled ocean-atmosphere model starting from the greenhouse gas concentration observed in 1935, i.e., at an early time of industrialization. The model was forced with observed greenhouse gas concentrations up to 1985, and with the equivalent C0", " concentrations stipulated in Scenario A (\"Business as Usual\") of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from 1985 to 2085. The early starting date alleviates some of the cold start problems. The global mean near surface temperature change in 2085 is about 0.3 K (ca. 10%) higher in the early industrialization experiment than in an integration with the same model and identical Scenario A greenhouse gas forcing, but with a start date in 1985. Comparisons between the experiments with early and late start dates show considerable differences in the amplitude of the regional climate change patterns, particularly for sea level. The early industrialization experiment can be used to obtain a first estimate of the detection time for a greenhouse-gas-induced near-surface temperature signal. Detection time estimates are obtained using globally and zonally averaged data from the experiment and a long control run, as well as principal component time series describing the evolution of the dominant signal and noise modes. The latter approach yields the earliest detection time (in the decade 1990-2000) for the time-evolving near-surface temperature signal. For global-mean temperatures or for temperatures averaged between 45\u00b0N and 45\u00b0S, the signal detection times are in the decades 2015-2025 and 2005-2015, respectively. The reduction of the \"cold start\" error in the early industrialization experiment makes it possible to separate the near-surface temperature signal from the noise about one decade earlier than in the experiment starting in 1985. We stress that these detection times are only valid in the context of the coupled model's internally-generated natural variability, which possibly underestimates low frequency fluctuations and does not incorporate the variance associated with changes in external forcing factors, such as anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, solar variability or volcanic dust. \u00a9 1995 Springer-Verlag."], "title": "A climate change simulation starting from 1935"},

During glacial afternoon floods, conductivity decreased while temperature and turbidity increased.

This study (Lal et al., 1998) reported our findings on the performance of each of the 17 global climate model experiments in simulating the present-day regional climatology over the Indian subcontinent. The analysis suggested that a few global climate models performed exceptionally well in their control simulation to represent the observed present-day climatological patterns over the region of interest. In this paper, we focus on the development of plausible climate change scenario for the Indian subcontinent based on selected model simulations with enhanced greenhouse gas forcings. Our analysis suggests that, for a 1\u00b0C rise in mean annual global temperature, the seasonal surface air temperature increase over the Indian subcontinent is likely to range from 0.7\u00b0C to 1.1\u00b0C during winter and 0.6\u00b0C to 1.0\u00b0C during summer. The increase in summer precipitation associated with the projected scaled rise in surface temperature could be between 1.2% to 4.5%. The model results do not suggest any significant change in the winter precipitation over the region. Taking into account the suggested range of climate sensitivity as well as the range of future greenhouse gas-induced global warming in selected general circulation model experiments, a plausible climate change scenario for the Indian subcontinent is developed for the years 2030 and 2070. A rise in mean winter surface air temperature of between 0.4\u00b0C to 1.7\u00b0C by the year 2030 and between 0.7\u00b0C to 3.4\u00b0C by the year 2070 is projected. During the summer season, the temperature rise is expected to range between 0.3\u00b0C to 1.4\u00b0C by the year 2030 and 0.6\u00b0C to 3.1\u00b0C by the year 2070.

The 'solar hypothesis' (as we shall term this assumption) claims that solar activity causes a significant component of the global mean temperature to vary in phase opposite to the filtered solar cycle lengths. In an earlier article we have demonstrated that for data covering the period 1860-1980 the solar hypothesis does not rule out any significant contribution from man-made greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols. The present analysis goes a step further. We analyse the period 1579-1987 and find that the solar hypothesis-instead of contradicting-appears to support the assumption of a significant warming due to human activities. We have tentatively 'corrected' the historical northern hemisphere land air temperature anomalies by removing the assumed effects of human activities. These are represented by northern hemisphere land air temperature anomalies calculated as the contributions from man-made greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols by using an upwelling diffusion-energy balance model similar to the model of Wigley and Raper (1993) employed in the Second Assessment Report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It turns out that the agreement of the filtered solar cycle lengths with the 'corrected' temperature anomalies is substantially better than with the historical anomalies, with the mean square deviation reduced by 36% for a climate sensitivity of 2.5\u00b0C, the central value of the IPCC assessment, and by 43% for the best-fit value of 1.7\u00b0C.

Under cold and humid wild (onshore) from the Arctic Ocean, the temperature gradient over the tundra ecosystem increased, which resulted in a high level of H. Under warm and dry air mass on clear days from the inland tundra (offshore), air and soil temperatures and the water vapour deficit increased, which resulted in an increase in lE. The same effect or air mass condition on energy partition was observed at the tundra ecosystem in Happy Valley located 135 km inland from the Arctic coast. The energy budget at wet sedge tundra was characterized as the heat storage within the water layer on a daily basis, which was partitioned mainly to lE in daytime and lE and H at night. Latent heat flux, lE, was largest at wet sedge tundra and lowest at dry tussock tundra. The Bowen ratio decreased with air temperature over wet sedge and dry tussock tundra ecosystems. The aerodynamic resistance r(a), and canopy resistance, r(c), over the wet sedge tundra at Happy Valley had different levels over four major wind directions. These levels decreased with increase in wind speed. r(a) was slightly higher than over other vegetation, which seemed to be owing to a relatively lower wind speed, while the canopy resistance r(c) was lower than over other vegetation. Global warming will affect the energy partition of the Arctic tundra ecosystem, and the warming and drying climate will increase the lE of tundra, especially in flooded areas. Expanding dry tundra increases H rather than lE, which enhances the warming of the tundra ecosystem.", "Energy budgets were measured at Arctic tundra ecosystems in Alaska, USA. Measurements were carried out over coastal tundra at Prudhoe Bay in 1994, and at wet sedge, moist and dry tussock tundra around Happy Valley in 1995. Sensible heat flux (H) and latent heat flux (lE) were determined by an eddy correlation technique. The observed energy partition at the coastal tundra and at the wet sedge tundra ecosystems and its effects on H and lH are presented.

This paper advocates that all activities emitting or saving carbon emissions should internalize the carbon cost inflicted or avoided by new projects involving CO", ". Considering the current wide range of carbon cost estimates, the paper recommends that a two-stage approach be adopted. Firstly, incorporate carbon costs in project analysis only theoretically in order to differentiate objectively among alternative designs involving carbon emissions of varying degrees. Different estimates of the costs of a ton of carbon would be used in order to test the sensitivity of rates of return to alternative carbon costings. While this process would have the effect of screening the allocation of scarce investment funds among projects that affect global warming in different degrees, it should be viewed as only a first step. Secondly, we advocate a rigorous process of passing through estimated carbon costs to the ultimate users of the services of carbon-emitting projects and processes. It is this ultimate process that will secure the urgently needed transition from the current dependence on fossil fuels to more benign sources of energy that would reduce climate-change risks.

Most of the land that was under forest cover at the turn of the nineteenth century is now covered with plantation crops. The districts of Kandy, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Ratnapura and Kegalle are the main hill country plantation areas. Within a period of less than half a century most of the forests in the hill country were cleared for plantation crops. Shifting cultivation was responsible for deforestation in the drier parts of the hill country. At the time of the British conquest of the hill country, the population of the whole island was not more than 3/4 to 1 million and they had settled in isolated villages at elevations below 1066 m. Subsistence agriculture was the main occupation of this predominantly rural population. During the first phase (1830-1880) of the plantation industry, large tracts of mostly forest land were cleared for coffee cultivation. By 1878, the extent of the coffee plantations reached its maximum of 111 336 ha most of which was situated in the wet zone hill country. The second phase of plantation agriculture began as the coffee industry was completely wiped out by a leaf disease. Most of the abandoned coffee plantations and the remaining forests were converted to tea, rubber and cinchona estates. The first two crops managed to survive price fluctuations in the world market, while the latter collapsed because of over production. During the period of large-scale deforestation in the hill country, the climate also underwent changes as exemplified by rainfall and temperature trends. However, these trends are not uniform everywhere in the plantation areas of the hill country. The temperature has risen a few degrees over a period of about a century and quarter in the hill country stations, while rainfall has declined significantly at some stations. These changes seem to be a result of the interaction of both global and local factors.

The current rapid conversion of Amazonian forest to cattle pasture makes disturbance of this carbon stock potentially important to the global carbon balance and net greenhouse gas emissions. Information on the response of soil carbon pools to conversion to cattle pasture is conflicting. Some of the varied results that have been reported can be explained by effects of soil compaction, clay content and seasonal changes. Most studies have compared roughly simultaneous samples taken at nearby sites with different use histories (i.e., 'chronosequences'); a clear need exists for longitudinal studies in which soil carbon stocks and related parameters are monitored over time at fixed locations. Whether pasture soils are a net sink or a net source of carbon depends on their management, but an approximation of the fraction of pastures under 'typical' and 'ideal' management practices indicates that pasture soils in Brazilian Amazonia are a net carbon source, with the upper 8 m releasing an average of 12.0 t C/ha in land maintained as pasture in the equilibrium landscape that is established in the decades following deforestation.

Overall, the e-folding residence time of atmospheric moisture is just over 8 days. New estimates are also made of how much moisture that precipitates out comes from horizontal transport versus local evaporation, referred to as 'recycling'. The results depend greatly on the scale of the domain under consideration and global maps of the recycling for annual means are produced for 500 km scales for which global recycling is 9.6%, consisting of 8.9% over land and 9.9% over the oceans. Even for 1000 km scales, less than 20% of the annual precipitation typically comes from evaporation within the domain. While average overall atmospheric moisture depletion and restoration must balance, precipitation falls only a small fraction of the time. Thus precipitation rates are also examined. Over the United States, one hour intervals with 0.1 mm or more are used to show that the frequency of precipitation ranges from over 30% in the Northwest, to about 20% in the Southeast and less than 4% just east of the continental divide in winter, and from less than 2% in California to over 20% in the Southeast in summer. In midlatitudes precipitation typically falls about 10% of the time, and so rainfall rates, conditional on when rain is falling, are much larger than evaporation rates. The mismatches in the rates of rainfall versus evaporation imply that precipitating systems of all kinds feed mostly on the moisture already in the atmosphere. Over North America, much of the precipitation originates from moisture advected from the Gulf of Mexico and subtropical Atlantic or Pacific a day or so earlier. Increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere produce global warming through an increase in downwelling infrared radiation, and thus not only increase surface temperatures but also enhance the hydrological cycle, as much of the heating at the surface goes into evaporating surface moisture. Global temperature increases signify that the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases and, together with enhanced evaporation, this means that the actual atmospheric moisture should increase. It follows that naturally-occurring droughts are likely to be exacerbated by enhanced potential evapotranspiration. Further, globally there must be an increase in precipitation to balance the enhanced evaporation but the processes by which precipitation is altered locally are not well understood. Observations confirm that atmospheric moisture is increasing in many places, for example at a rate of about 5% per decade over the United States. Based on the above results, we argue that increased moisture content of the atmosphere therefore favors stronger rainfall or snowfall events, thus increasing risk of flooding, which is a pattern observed to be happening in many parts of the world. Moreover, because there is a disparity between the rates of increase of atmospheric moisture and precipitation, there are implied changes in the frequency of precipitation and/or efficiency of precipitation (related to how much moisture is left behind in a storm). However, an analysis of linear trends in the frequency of precipitation events for the United States corresponding to thresholds of 0.1 and 1 mm/h shows that the most notable statistically significant trends are for increases in the southern United States in winter and decreases in the Pacific Northwest from November through January, which may be related to changes in atmospheric circulation and storm tracks associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation trends. It is suggested that as the physical constraints on precipitation apply only globally, more attention should be paid to rates in both observations and models as well as the frequency of occurrence."], "title": "Atmospheric moisture residence times and cycling: Implications for rainfall rates and climate change"},

We studied flowering and fruiting of 10 angiosperm species in a subalpine meadow over 4 yr, focusing on plant responses to warming by overhead heaters. The 10 species reproduced in a predictable sequence during 3-4 mo between spring snowmelt and fall frosts. Experimental warming advanced the date of snowmelt by almost 1 wk on average, relative to controls, and similarly advanced the mean timing of plant reproduction. This phenological shift was entirely explained by earlier snowmelt in the case of six plant species that flowered early in the season, whereas four later-flowering species apparently responded to other cues. Experimental warming had no detectable effect on the duration of flowering and fruiting, even though natural conditions of early snowmelt were associated with longer duration and greater overlap of reproduction of sequentially flowering species. Fruit set was greater in warmed plots for most species, but this effect was not significant for any species individually. We conclude that global warming will cause immediate phenological shifts in plant communities at high elevations, mediated largely through changes in timing of snowmelt. Shifts on longer time scales are also likely as plant fitnesses, population dynamics, and community structure respond to altered phenology of species relative to one another and to animal mutualists and enemies.

To account for the effects of the interaction of various scales of motion on cloud development, a synoptic-scale vertical velocity field is superimposed on the mesoscale velocity field generated by the model, mimicking the effects of an upper-level shortwave trough. The main results under the conditions simulated here are the following. Cirrus cloud growth is much slower than assumed previously, because the process of vapor deposition to ice crystals is far from instantaneous: the crystal phase relaxation time (i.e., the characteristic time of vapor absorption by crystals) takes 0.5-2.0 h. Even after 1 h of cloud development, supersaturation with respect to ice can remain 5%-10%, while the condensed ice is only 40%-60% of the amount that would be realized assuming that all excess vapor is transformed into ice in typical model time steps.

Sensitivity tests show that the use of such values increases cooling in the upper cloud and heating in the lower cloud, which can lead to an unwarranted increase in upper-tropospheric static instability. The postulated effects of the positive feedbacks between clouds and greenhouse gas-induced global warming would likely be different in magnitude (or in sign) if the more realistic approach of using cloud microstructure-dependent absorption and scattering coefficients could be adopted.

Several simulation models have been constructed to predict the increase in the number of generations, but these require a great deal of calculation to obtain estimates for many insect species at various locations under various scenarios of global warming.

(2) The increase in temperature is approximately even throughout the year.

The analysis was performed on all 1 km grid points of the Swiss forest inventory (c. 11,500 points) as well as on two subsets representing the forested points within the geographical limits of two inventories of legally protected reserve areas. The core of the approach is (a) a conceptual model of the movement of climatic ranges along altitudinal gradients as a result of global warming and (b) a spatially explicit forest community simulator that predicts a potential natural vegetation unit for any given 1 km grid point of the Swiss forest inventory for both current climate and for altered climate regimes. The model is derived from empirical data featuring the relationships between quasi-natural vegetation types and measured site variables. Species richness for any modelled forest community is estimated on the basis of phytosociological releves. The conceptual model showed that out of 109 legally protected landscapes, sites and natural monuments of national importance (minimum area > 1 km", ") about 40-50% have an altitudinal or degree-day range that is able to host migrating species within the reserve limits if climate is warming in a moderate way (increase of mean annual temperature between + 1.0 and + 1.4\u00b0C). In the case of strong warming (increase of mean annual temperature between + 2.0 and +2.8\u00b0C) only 20-30% fulfil this criterion.

In the montane belt, the dominance of conifers will be seriously threatened by an invasion of deciduous species from the low montane and submontane belt. Under warmer and wetter conditions the vegetation shifts might not be as drastic as under warmer and more xeric conditions and the shift towards oak and oak-hornbeam communities on the Plateau is not supported. Concerning species richness, the models showed that in the case of warmer temperatures and constant precipitation (warmer and more xeric due to increased evapotranspiration) overall species richness is increasing on all 1 km points of the Swiss Forest Inventory, as well as on all selected subsets representing the forested points within legally protected reserve areas.

The experiment was managed using conventional mechanical tillage from 1957 to 1989; it was changed to no-tillage management in 1990. Our objective was to determine: (a) if change to no-tillage management had changed soil C and N storage, and (b) if method of calculating organic C and N change would influence interpretation of the results. All three methods of calculation confirmed the efficacy of employing best management practices (e.g., fertilization based on soil tests, reducing summerfallow, including legumes in rotations) for increasing or maintaining soil organic matter, and showed that the latter was directly associated with the amount of crop residues returned to the soil. Where bulk density was significantly different between sampling times, the often used mass per fixed depth (MFD) (i.e., volume basis) calculation can lead to erroneous conclusions. When the recently recommended mass per equal depth (MED) method of calculation was used, it showed that 6 yr of no-tillage did not increase soil organic C or total N. However, in unfertilized systems, where crop yields are gradually decreasing since the change, there is an accompanying decrease in organic matter, while fertilized, or high-fertility systems that include legume hay crops, in which wheat yields have been maintained have tended to maintain the organic matter level over time. When the MFD calculation was used, there was no change in C over time when straw was harvested in the F-W-W system; however, the MED calculation and concentrations tend to show a decrease in soil C and N. This suggests that in time, industrial use of straw may have negative consequences for soil conservation.

High correlation coefficients were found between geomagnetic activity, the sea level atmospheric pressure and the surface air temperature, occurring with a positive sign in the middle and southern Europe, in the south-eastern part of North America and in the western Atlantic hut with a negative sign in the northern Atlantic and Canada. In the hypothesis proposed here for explaining Sun-weather relations, downward winds following the geomagnetic storm onset are generated in the polar cup of the thermosphere and penetrate to the stratosphere and troposphere, where the atmospheric response can be observed as a sudden increase of pressure and temperature. The subsidence effects along the northern margin of the subpolar high pressure areas (mainly the Siberian high) are accelerated and strong eastward winds participate in the intensification of the northern jet stream and in the successive zonalization of flow in mid-latitudes. It is shown that at a time of low geomagnetic activity planetary waves with large amplitudes prevail in the northern hemisphere due to the orographic effect of the Rocky Mountains and Greenland. On the other hand, at a time of high geomagnetic activity, an intensification of the winds can be observed not only in the thermosphere but also in the troposphere. A strong northern jet stream participates in the intensification of the westerly zonal flow and in the increase of temperature successively in the eastern part of North America, in Europe and northern Asia. These relations are clearly detectable not only in monthly averages of the pressure and temperature distribution but also in the daily variations of atmospheric circulation. The results enable us to test a causal link of the Sun-weather processes, to explain strong interannual climate and weather changes in several key regions of the northern hemisphere, mainly in winter, and to study possible causes of the North Atlantic Oscillation.

As such, the enhanced greenhouse effect is a plausible explanation for the observed global warming. Long term natural variability is another prime candidate for explaining the temperature rise of the last century. Analysis of natural variability from paleo-reconstructions, however, shows that human activity is so much more likely an explanation that the earlier conclusion is not refuted. But, even if one believes in large natural climatic variability, the odds are invariably in favour of the enhanced greenhouse effect. The above conclusions hold for a range of statistical models, including one that is capable of describing the stabilization of the global mean temperature from the 1940s to the 1970s onwards. This model is also shown to be otherwise statistically adequate. The estimated climate sensitivity is about 3.8\u00b0C with a standard deviation of 0.9\u00b0C, but depends slightly on which model is preferred and how much natural variability is allowed. These estimates neglect, however, the fact that carbon dioxide is but one of a number of greenhouse gases and that sulphate aerosols may well have dampened warming. Acknowledging the fact that carbon dioxide is used as a proxy for all human induced changes in radiative forcing brings a lot of additional uncertainty. Prior knowledge on both climate sensitivity and radiative forcing is needed to say anything about the respective sizes. A fully Bayesian approach is used to combine expert knowledge with information from the observations. Prior knowledge on the climate sensitivity plays a dominant role. The data largely exclude climate sensitivity to be small, but cannot exclude climate sensitivity to be large, because of the possibility of strong negative sulphate forcing. The posterior of climate sensitivity has a strong positive skewness. Moreover, its mode (again 3.8 \u00b0C; standard deviation 2.4\u00b0C) is higher than the best guess of the IPCC."], "title": "A Bayesian statistical analysis of the enhanced greenhouse effect"},

For each recycling method, a first calculation sequence is performed varying recycle volume at fixed ore: fuel ratio, and also a second sequence at fixed average liquid metal outflow temperature.

Among various technological options for reducing the CO2 emissions from energy production, nuclear power is expected to play a key role if accepted by the society. However, there have been fewer model analyses reported recently on the role of nuclear power in the global energy system when compared with the analyses of the other options such as energy efficiency improvements, renewable energies, and CO2 recovery and disposal. This paper presents, with a newly developed global energy model, a numerical analysis on the value of nuclear option in the global energy system, particularly in terms of CO2 mitigation. With the global energy model, which finds the cost minimum energy system over the time range of 1995-2055, the value of nuclear power is analyzed. The model incorporates detailed descriptions of energy conversion technologies which include, besides electricity generation, various liquefaction and gasification processes of hydrocarbon fuels with the options of CO2 recovery and disposal. For nuclear technologies, LWRs (light water reactors) and FBRs (fast breeder reactors) are taken into account with fuel cycle options. Major findings are: 1) LWRs would be introduced at the maximum level into the cost minimum energy system if their economics is slightly improved from the standard assumption; however, 2) the maximum introduction of LWRs would make only a small effect in reducing the global CO2 emissions; 3) FBRs would be introduced at an almost maximum scale when the stabilization of global CO2 emission is required; 4) the role of FBRs in reducing the global CO2 emission is very robust against the deterioration of their economics; and 5) IGCC (integrated coal gasification combined cycle power generation) with CO2 recovery would replace the role when FBRs are not introduced. @ 1997 published by Elsevier Science Ltd."], "title": "Nuclear power in the global energy-environmental system"},

The results from ice-sheet modelling show that the increased basal melt rates lead to a reduction of the ice shelves, increased strain rates and flow at the grounding lines, then thinning and floating of the marine ice sheets, with consequential further basal melting. The mass loss from basal melting is counteracted to some extent by the increased accumulation, but in the long term the area of ice cover decreases, particularly in West Antarctica, and the mass loss can dominate.

With selected species - the Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) and Redstarts (genus Phoenicurus) - it has been shown that all the basic processes and features of migration, such as migratory drive, migratory disposition and activity, and orientation behaviour, are under direct genetic control. The considerable phenotypic and additive genetic variation in these traits provides a great potential for microevolution. Partial migration - the occurrence of migratoriness and sedentariness within the same population - appears to play a major role: it is a turntable, so to speak, for appropriate adaptations. Extremely widespread at higher latitudes and also common in the tropics, partial migration may be a fundamental pattern of avian behaviour. Its phenotypic dichotomy migrant-nonmigrant is caused by a genetic threshold mechanism, on the basis of which full migratoriness or sedentariness can be selected within a few generations. Since incidence and amount of migratory activity clearly represent a genetically integrated migration syndrome, downward selection of migratory activity in exclusively migratory populations resulting in shorter migration distances would also lead to partial migration. Birds are thus evidently capable of adapting to changing environmental conditions by shifting from almost full sedentariness to exclusive migratoriness and vice versa based on selection. Experimental and field evidence indicates that such a shift can be accomplished in less than 50 years, which makes partial migration a highly adaptive trait."], "title": "Bird migration: Genetic programs with high adaptability"},

The prevailing critical conditions and their economic and social impacts provide a basis for the characterization of an adverse climate change scenario for the region. The causes of the early 1970s scenario were assessed in this study in order to determine whether or not it could be related to global warming conditions. River flows are dependent on winter precipitation and on accumulated snow on the Andes cordillera. The lowest negative river flow value observed can be explained by the behaviour of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and other macroclimatic parameters, such as sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It was observed that the SOI is the parameter most strongly correlated with river flows. The highest correlation was found for the 2.4- and 4.8-yr frequencies and the low 43-yr frequency. Consequently, the low river flow values observed during the early 1970s are considered to be related to a low-frequency minimum of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as well as to the behaviour of sea-surface temperature close to the coast of Chile. Both factors are associated with a minimum hemispheric temperature value. It is concluded that the 1960-70 drought in the oases of the Cordillera was not linked to a warm period. Therefore it is not appropriate, at least for the time being, to state that the oases will experience drought conditions under a global warming scenario with temperature increases of a few degrees."], "title": "Impacts of climate change on the oases of the Argentinean cordillera"},

Climate change scenarios included changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation from two GCMs interpolated to 1\u00b0x 1\u00b0grid cells in the central Piedmont in North Carolina. Changes in mean monthly temperature and precipitation from the GCMs were used to adjust observed daily climate records from 1949-1988. There is convincing evidence that future temperature linked to global warming might be characterized by asymmetric change between daily daytime maxima and daily nighttime minima. Two hypotheses regarding how GCM temperature would alter observational record were examined. The first hypothesis assumed that daytime and nighttime warming occurs symmetrically, i.e., maximum and minimum temperatures are raised equally. The second hypothesis assumed that nighttime minima change is three times greater than daytime maxima change and the change in mean diurnal temperature range is approximately equal to the change in daily mean temperature. For the equal day-night warming scenario, when only the effects of climate change (i.e., changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation) were considered, simulations with CERES and EPIC indicated substantial losses in maize grain yield and total above ground biomass with both the GCM scenarios.

Development of irrigated ricefields which house both An. arabiensis and An. funestus had created a new anthropic environment. Moreover manpower imported from malarious coastal areas for rice cultivation and also for building large temples, could have brought P. falciparum. After several outbreaks the disease became endemic up to 1949. In 1949 a malaria eradication programme based on DDT spraying and drug chemoprophylaxis and chemotherapy was launched. By 1960 malaria was eliminated and DDT spraying cancelled. Only 3 foci were kept under surveillance with irregular spraying until 1975. The prophylaxis and treatment centres (\u00ab centres de nivaquinisation \u00bb) were kept open up to 1979. The catholic dispensary of Analaroa, 100km N.E. of Tananarive, opened in 1971 and worked without interruption up to now. The malaria diagnosis has always been controlled by microscopy. Its registers are probably the more reliable source of information on malaria in the area. They show that malaria was already present on the Highlands in 1971 but at a low prevalence ; in 1980 when the \u00abcentres de nivaquinisation \u00bb were closed the number of cases increased by three times ; the progressive increase of the number of cases became exponential from 1986 to 1988 which was the peak of the epidemic ; malaria remained at a high level until the end of 1993 ; yearly DDT spraying since 1993 have decreased the number of malaria cases among the dispensary attendants by 90 %. The epidemic peak of 1988 was well documented by the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar around Tananarive. Before the epidemic started it was observed a come back of An. funestus which had been previously eliminated of most of the villages by DDT spraying. More than an epidemic the malaria increase in 1988 was a reconquest by malaria of the land from which it had been eliminated in the years 1950. This episode became dramatic because the lack of immunity of the population and the shortage of medicaments. The global warming which was advocated to explain the epidemic has no responsibility because the temperature on the Madagascar Highlands has not changed during the last 30 years. Also the cyclones do not seem to have played any role. It is very likely that the gradual decline of control measures, first DDT spraying, later drug distributions, had the main responsibility in the Highlands drama.

Are tools for nonmarket valuation, as found in the Principles and Guidelines satisfactory for water resource project evaluation with a changing climate? The potential effects of climate change are so numerous and subtle that it would be prohibitively costly to measure them all. Thus a comprehensive program for including nonmarket damages as part of the costs of global warming seems ill-advised. Where specific concerns arise, researchers may learn from small scale studies. Many of the damages of global warming are diminished by the ability of humans to adapt at small costs, especially the nonuse component of nonmarket values. When the question concerns minor water resource projects, the gains from including extra effects induced by global warming seem to be small compared with the costs. The Principles and Guidelines does not reflect current practices in benefit estimation. However, it is not clear that this is a serious problem, because most practitioners continue to revise their understanding of valuation methods.

There is overwhelming evidence that repeated tillage is destroying the soil resource base and causing adverse environmental impacts. Tillage degrades the fertility of soils, causes air and water pollution, intensifies drought stress, destroys wildlife habitat, wastes fuel energy, and contributes to global warming. Consequently, most tillage-based systems in a dryland environment are not sustainable in the long-term. Today, dryland farmers are expected to produce food in ever greater quantities. This is becoming more difficult to do in view of declining soil quality, most of which is caused by soil tillage. It is becoming well documented scientifically that continuous no-till is the most effective, and practical approach for restoring and improving soil quality which is vital for sustained food production and a healthy environment. With this way of farming crop, residues or other organic amendments are retained on the soil surface and sowing/fertilizing is done with minimal soil disturbance. Research and farmers' experience indicate that with continuous no-till soil organic matter increases, soil structure improves, soil erosion is controlled, and in time crop yields increase substantially from what they were under tillage management, due to improved water relations and nutrient availability. These changes help to promote a cleaner and healthier environment and a more sustainable agriculture. A major obstacle that farmers often face with change to continuous no-till is overcoming yield-limiting factors during the transition years, that is, the first years of no-till following a history of intensive conventional tillage. These factors are often poorly understood and may be biologically-driven. Some of the problems involve residue management and increased weed and disease infestations. Farmer experience seems to indicate that many problems during the transition are temporary and become less important as the no-till system matures and equilibrates. The judicious use of crop rotations, cover crops and some soil disturbance may help reduce agronomic risks during the transition years. Farmers switching to continuous no-till must often seek new knowledge and develop new skills and techniques in order to achieve success with this new and different way of farming. Answers to their questions are urgently needed to provide strategies for promoting no-till as a way to enhance agricultural sustainability for future generations."], "title": "No-till farming: The way of the future for a sustainable dryland agriculture"},

While a single fingerprint is optimal for the detection of climate change, further tests of the statistical consistency of the detected climate change signal with model predictions for different candidate forcing mechanisms require the simultaneous application of several fingerprints. Model-predicted climate change signals are derived from three anthropogenic global warming simulations for the period 1880 to 2049 and two simulations forced by estimated changes in solar radiation from 1700 to 1992. In the first global warming simulation, the forcing is by greenhouse gas only, while in the remaining two simulations the direct influence of sulfate aerosols is also included. From the climate change signals of the greenhouse gas only and the average of the two greenhouse gas-plus-aerosol simulations, two optimized fingerprint patterns are derived by weighting the model-predicted climate change patterns towards low-noise directions. The optimized fingerprint patterns are then applied as a filter to the observed near-surface temperature trend patterns, yielding several detection variables. The space-time structure of natural climate variability needed to determine the optimal fingerprint pattern and the resultant signal-to-noise ratio of the detection variable is estimated from several multi-century control simulations with different CGCMs and from instrumental data over the last 136 y. Applying the combined greenhouse gas-plus-aerosol fingerprint in the same way as the greenhouse gas only fingerprint in a previous work, the recent 30-y trends (1966-1995) of annual mean near surface temperature are again found to represent a significant climate change at the 97.5% confidence level. However, using both the greenhouse gas and the combined forcing fingerprints in a two-pattern analysis, a substantially better agreement between observations and the climate model prediction is found for the combined forcing simulation. Anticipating that the influence of the aerosol forcing is strongest for longer term temperature trends in summer, application of the detection and attribution test to the latest observed 50-y trend pattern of summer temperature yielded statistical consistency with the greenhouse gas-plus-aerosol simulation with respect to both the pattern and amplitude of the signal. In contrast, the observations are inconsistent with the greenhouse-gas only climate change signal at a 95% confidence level for all estimates of climate variability. The observed trend 1943-1992 is furthermore inconsistent with a hypothesized solar radiation change alone at an estimated 90% confidence level. Thus, in contrast to the single pattern analysis, the two pattern analysis is able to discriminate between different forcing hypotheses in the observed climate change signal. The results are subject to uncertainties associated with the forcing history, which is poorly known for the solar and aerosol forcing, the possible omission of other important forcings, and inevitable model errors in the computation of the response to the forcing. Further uncertainties in the estimated significance levels arise from the use of model internal variability simulations and relatively short instrumental observations (after subtraction of an estimated greenhouse gas signal) to estimate the natural climate variability. The resulting confidence limits accordingly vary for different estimates using different variability data. Despite these uncertainties, however, we consider our results sufficiently robust to have some confidence in our finding that the observed climate change is consistent with a combined greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing, but inconsistent with greenhouse gas or solar forcing alone."], "title": "Multi-fingerprint detection and attribution analysis of greenhouse gas, greenhouse gas-plus-aerosol and solar forced climate change"},

In recent years, however, recognition has been growing that the six air issues are interrelated through complex feedbacks, lags and synergisms. For example, replacing CFCs may slow down stratospheric ozone depletion, but the replacement gases may contribute to climate warming. The lesson to be learned by both scientists and policy analysts is therefore that strategies for dealing with a particular issue may not be optimal for the whole. Two examples are given to illustrate the point.

Direct evidence of a positive feedback of global warming on N", "O emissions comes from studies of air in ice cores. One of the projected effects of future global warming is a lowering of water tables in northern peatlands; experiments suggest that this would lead to increased emissions, but that the effect on total emissions would be small. The results of many experiments with non-peatland soils indicate that the effect of temperature on soil emissions is generally positive, and that the rate of increase may be very steep when denitrification is the principal process involved. Process-level modelling suggests that the reason is increased soil respiration, which causes an increase in anaerobic volume in which denitrification can take place, in addition to the increased denitrification rate per unit anaerobic volume brought about directly by the rise in temperature. These results imply that generally a positive feedback on emissions from soils is likely. However, in some environments, a large proportion of total annual emissions can occur during freeze-thaw cycles; such cycles may become more or less frequent, depending on the climatic zone, and this may result in either a positive or negative feedback effect due to global warming. Models of global and regional trends give very conflicting predictions of the direction and the magnitude of climatic impacts on fluxes, but the prediction of a positive feedback seems to be the more soundly based. \u00a9 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd."], "title": "The potential for feedback effects induced by global warming on emissions of nitrous oxide by soils"},

While the internal variability of the atmosphere by itself is only predictable over a period of one to two weeks, climate variations are potentially predictable for much longer periods of months or even years because of coupling with the ocean. This work presents details from the first study to quantify the predictability for simulated multidecadal climate variability over the North Atlantic. The model used for this purpose is the GFDL coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model used extensively for studies of global warming and natural climate variability. This model contains fluctuations of the North Atlantic and high-latitude oceanic circulation with variability concentrated in the 40-60 year range. Oceanic predictability is quantified through analysis of the time-dependent behavior of large-scale empirical orthogonal function (EOF) patterns for the meridional stream function, dynamic topography, 170 m temperature, surface temperature and surface salinity. The results indicate that predictability in the North Atlantic depends on three main physical mechanisms. The first involves the oceanic deep convection in the subpolar region which acts to integrate atmospheric fluctuations, thus providing for a red noise oceanic response as elaborated by Hasselmann. The second involves the large-scale dynamics of the thermohaline circulation, which can cause the oceanic variations to have an oscillatory character on the multi-decadal time scale. The third involves nonlocal effects on the North Atlantic arising from periodic anomalous fresh water transport advecting southward from the polar regions in the East Greenland Current. When the multi-decadal oscillatory variations of the thermohaline circulation are active, the first and second EOF patterns for the North Atlantic dynamic topography have predictability time scales on the order of 10-20 y, whereas EOF-1 of SST has predictability time scales of 5-7 y. When the thermohaline variability has weak multidecadal power, the Hasselmann mechanism is dominant and the predictability is reduced by at least a factor of two. When the third mechanism is in an extreme phase, the North Atlantic dynamic topography patterns realize a 10-20 year predictability time scale. Additional analysis of SST in the Greenland Sea, in a region associated with the southward propagating fresh water anomalies, indicates the potential for decadal scale predictability for this high latitude region as well. The model calculations also allow insight into regional variations of predictability, which might be useful information for the design of a monitoring system for the North Atlantic. Predictability appears to break down most rapidly in regions of active convection in the high-latitude regions of the North Atlantic."], "title": "A predictability study of simulated North Atlantic multidecadal variability"},

These high pressure episodes are accompanied by large positive temperature anomalies and low precipitation, both of which are unfavorable for snow accumulation during the Winter. The fluctuations of seasonal to annual pressure in the Alpine region is strongly correlated with anomalies of the North Atlantic Oscillation index, which is a measure of the strength of the westerly flow over the Atlantic.

Dietary chlorogenic acid, rutin and tomatine levels reflected those occurring naturally in the leaves of tomato, a hostplant of this herbivore. We compared the effects of four thermal regimes having a daytime temperature of 26\u00b0C, with the night-time temperature increased from 14 to 26\u00b0C by increments of 4\u00b0C. The effect of a particular allelochemical on developmental rate was similar among the four thermal regimes. Chlorogenic acid and tomatine each reduced final larval weight, but there was no effect of night-time temperature. In contrast, rutin had no effect on final weight, whereas final weight declined with increasing nigh-time temperature. Night-time temperature did not influence amount eaten. Larvae ate less when chlorogenic acid or tomatine was in the diet. For each allelochemical, there were no allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. In addition, we compared the effects of allelochemicals and the thermal regime of 26:14\u00b0C and constant 20\u00b0C, which was the average temperature of the 26:14\u00b0C regime. Developmental rate was lower at the constant 20\u00b0C regime, chlorogenic acid and tomatine each depressed developmental rate, and there were no allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. Thus, regardless of the specific allelochemical or amount, the pattern of response at the fluctuating regime was similar to that at the constant temperature. In contrast, comparison of the thermal regime of 26:22\u00b0C and constant 24\u00b0C, which was the average temperature of the 26:22\u00b0C regime, showed several allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. At the 26:22\u00b0C regime, developmental rate was disproportionatly higher at the maximal rutin concentration compared to that at constant 24\u00b0C. At the constant 24\u00b0C, final larval mass was disproportionately lower at the moderate tomatine concentration compared to that at the 26:22\u00b0C regime. Because these results differ from that of other studies examining another species, it appears that the response to incremental changes in night-time temperature will reflect the allelochemicals and insect species tested. The contrast between the constant 24\u00b0C and 26:22\u00b0C regimes indicates that even small fluctuations (\u00b12\u00b0C) in temperature over 24 h can yield differences in the response to an allelochemical."], "title": "Combined effects of night-time temperature and allelochemicals on performance of a generalist insect herbivore"},

Triggering is attributed to stronger storm activity in the Labrador-Baffin area, caused by warming in the Labrador Sea and cooling in the Greenland-Norwegian Sea. The key to this temperature and circulation change may have been an increase in the hydrologic deficit of the Mediterranean Sea.

Accordingly, the satellite record has been widely cited by sceptics as evidence against global warming. However, a substantial fraction of the measured radiance originates not from the atmosphere but from the Earth's surface, and gives rise to high noise levels. This noise can lead to errors when merging temperature time series obtained from different satellites. Here we present comparisons among different MSU retrievals, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and equivalent MSU temperatures derived from an atmospheric general circulation model forced with observed SSTs. The comparisons, focused on the tropics where atmospheric temperatures are closely tied to SSTs, strongly suggest that two spurious downward jumps occur in the MSU-2R record coinciding with changes in satellites, and that the real trend in MSU temperatures is likely to be positive, albeit small."], "title": "Spurious trends in satellite MSU temperatures from merging different satellite records"},

How these emissions and their impacts should be calculated, and how comparisons should be made with global warming contributions of alternative energy sources such as fossil fuels, can lead to sharp differences in conclusions on the relative advantages of these options. The example of Brazil's Tucurui Dam is examined to clarify these differences. The present paper extends an earlier analysis to 100 years and explores the differences between these and comparable fossil fuel emissions. Factors considered here in calculating emissions for Tucurui Dam include the initial stock and distribution of carbon, decay rates and pathways (leading to carbon dioxide and methane), and losses of power in transmission lines. Factors not considered include forest degradation on islands and reservoir shores, nitrous oxide sources in drawdown zones and transmission lines, additional methane emission pathways for release from standing trees, water passing through the turbines, etc. Construction-phase emissions are also not included; neither are emissions from deforestation by people displaced by and attracted to the project. A complete accounting of the alternative landscape is also lacking. Standardization of the level of reliability of the electricity supply is needed to compare hydroelectric and thermoelectric options. Types of emission calculations commonly used include the ultimate contribution to emissions, the annual balance of emissions in a given year, and emissions over a long time horizon (such as 100 years). The timing of emissions differs between hydroelectric and thermal generation, hydro producing a large pulse of carbon dioxide emissions in the first years after filling the reservoir while thermal produces a constant flux of gases in proportion to the power generated. The impacts of emissions are related to the atmospheric load (stocks) of the gases rather than to the emissions (flows), and therefore last over a long time. According to the calculations in the present paper, the average carbon dioxide molecule in the atmospheric load contributed by Tucurui was present in the atmosphere 15 years earlier than the average molecule in the comparable load from fossil fuel generation. This means that, considering a 100-year time horizon, a tonne of CO", " emitted by Tucurui has 15% more global warming impact than a tonne emitted by fossil fuel, assuming no discounting. If discounting is applied, then the relative impact of the hydroelectric option is increased. Time preference, either by discounting or by an alternative procedure, is a key factor affecting the attractiveness of hydroelectric power. At low annual discount rates (say 1- 2%), the attractiveness of Tucurui, although less than without discounting, is still 3-4 times better than fossil-fuel generation. If the discount rate reaches 15%, the situation is reversed, and fossil-fuel generation becomes more attractive from a global-warming perspective.

The experiment is discussed in the light of the greenhouse warming experiment by Arrhenius. The transient calculation started in January 1860 and continued until the end of the 21st century. The effect of individual greenhouse gases has been incorporated using observed data until 1990 and thereafter assumed emissions according to (IPCC) scenario IS92a. Validation of the coupled model shows a realistic simulation of observed coupled modes such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The simulated low frequency variability at middle and high latitudes resembles, by and large, the observed one. A detailed evaluation over Scandinavia shows that the model reproduces the typical very strong interannual variability of this region. The result shows a small warming until present in broad agreement with observations. There is a strong positive feedback with water vapor but a negative feedback with clouds. The evaluation is concentrated at the time the concentration of the greenhouse gases has doubled compared to the starting time. Such a doubling is expected to take place in 2030-2040. The energy cycle is slowly changing and a gradual increase in the absorption of short-wave radiation in the atmosphere and an increase in the net long-wave radiation at the ground are noted. The latent heat flux from the surface of the earth increases while the sensible heat flux decreases. The hydrological cycle increases very slowly and mainly over land. After 1990, a rapid warming is starting which goes on with superimposed minor multidecadal variations until the end of the run. Overall global warming amounts to some 3.5\u00b0C for the period 1990 to 2100. At the time of greenhouse gas doubling, the global warming amounts to 1.9\u00b0C. The typical feedback pattern for the early part of the run continues with increasing amplitude and so do the changes in the hydrological cycle. The warming pattern shows a strong amplitude in the Arctic associated with a marked retreat of Arctic sea ice.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the total C storage of different ecosystems along a north-south transect in Alaska. Soil pedons from three Alaska climate zones were studied. These zones were the arctic slope with continuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly tussock tundra and coastal marsh, Interior Alaska with discontinuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly spruce forest on the upland and tundra or bog in the lowland, and Southern Alaska free of permafrost with the vegetation predominantly mixed hardwood and conifers with moss bogs. Soil samples were taken from the representative ecosystems of these zones for carbon storage analysis. In the Arctic and Interior Alaska zones, many soils are cryoturbated and as a result the horizons are warped and often broken. These conditions made it impractical to use the common method for estimating C storage that is used for soils with roughly parallel horizons. For this study the linear proportion of each horizon in the cryoturbated pedon was digitized by using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the irregular horizons were collapsed to form a simulated profile with parallel horizons. The carbon content of each pedon was then calculated based on the linear proportions. These carbon stores based on the whole soil (1 m deep) approach were compared to other available estimates from the literature. Calculations for pedons from selected ecosystems in Alaska ranged from 169 MgC/ha to 1292 MgC/ha. The organic carbon storage of the arctic coastal marsh pedon amounted to 692 MgC/ha, and that of the arctic tundra pedon amounted to 314 and 599 MgC/ha. The carbon storage of interior forest pedons was 169 and 787 MgC/ha, and the associated organic soil stored nearly 1300 MgC/ha. The carbon storage in the mixed forest and coastal forest pedons was 240 and 437 MgC/ha, respectively. The bog associated with the mixed and coastal forest stored 1260 MgC/ha. Soils with the thickest organic layers were bogs associated with the tundra and boreal forest. These soils had the largest carbon storage. Carbon stores estimated from the whole pedon approach are 30 to 100% higher than those from the literature from the same zones.

Death rate of biomass quotient (qD) calculated over the 150 days period of incubation showed that tropical and temperate soils, at 15\u00b0C. have similar values, but at 35\u00b0C temperate soils had higher rates than tropical soils, confirming the existence of some sensitivity of temperate soils to elevated temperature. Carbon from carbon dioxide (CO ", "-C) was also measured for all soils investigated. There was a greater respiration rate at 35\u00b0C than at 15\u00b0C for all the soils. The temperate soils showed faster mineralization rate than the tropical, mainly at 35\u00b0C.

Impacts under baseline assumptions are estimated to be $0.007/kWh of electricity, $0.23/klb of steam, and $0.004/ton-h of chilled water (representing 2-9% of the market value of outputs). Impacts are largely related to ozone (48%) and particulate matter (42%). Addition of upstream emissions and nonpublic health impacts increases externalities by as much as 50%. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the importance of plant siting, meteorological conditions, epidemiological assumptions, and the monetary value placed on premature mortality as well as the potential influence of global warming. Comparative analyses demonstrate that our model provides reasonable impact estimates and would therefore be applicable in a broad range of policy settings."], "title": "Development of a new damage function model for power plants: Methodology and applications"},

The TTW environmental impacts are the main topic of this article. Materials and methods Renault's cars pollutant emissions are measured on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to comply with Euro regulations. The results have been used to show the variability of the emissions in the TTW stage. Five E85 flex-fuel vehicles were also tested to check their compliance with Euro standards, enabling to show the effect of an alternative fuel such as ethanol on pollutant emissions. Finally, Euro standard emission thresholds were transposed into environmental impacts to see how they affect TTW results. Results and discussion The TTW stage is very significant for the environmental impacts selected. The results show the unpredictable variability of the impacts between vehicles and when switching from gasoline to ethanol (E85). However, this variability is inferior compared with the differences between cars complying with different Euro standards. Conclusions Measured emissions on a car on NEDC cycle may not be suitable as the input data for TTW calculations. Euro standards associated with average fuel consumptions may be used as the basis for TTW impacts and should be chosen carefully in order to be relevant with the scope of the study.

Simulations under future climate-change-induced temperature and flow regimes with present land use projected a 69% decrease in mean fish density (8.5 fish/ha) from present and an unstable population that went extinct during 56% of the simulations. However, when simulated under a future climate-altered temperature and flow regime with historical land use, the population increased by 66% (45.0 fish/ha) from present and sustained a harvest. Our findings suggest that land-use changes may be a greater detriment to riverine fishes than projected climate change and that the combined effects of both factors may lead to local species extinction. However, the negative effects of increased temperature and precipitation associated with future global warming could be mitigated by river channel, floodplain, and watershed restoration."], "title": "Modeling the effects of land use and climate change on riverine smallmouth bass"},

ITEX was designed specifically to examine variability in arctic and alpine species response to increased temperature. We compiled from one to four years of experimental data from 13 different ITEX sites and used meta-analysis to analyze responses of plant phenology, growth, and reproduction to experimental warming. Results indicate that key phenological events such as leaf bud burst and flowering occurred earlier in warmed plots throughout the study period; however, there was little impact on growth cessation at the end of the season. Quantitative measures of vegetative growth were greatest in warmed plots in the early years of the experiment, whereas reproductive effort and success increased in later years. A shift away from vegetative growth and toward reproductive effort and success in the fourth treatment year suggests a shift from the initial response to a secondary response. The change in vegetative response may be due to depletion of stored plant reserves, whereas the lag in reproductive response may be due to the formation of flower buds one to several seasons prior to flowering. Both vegetative and reproductive responses varied among life-forms; herbaceous forms had stronger and more consistent vegetative growth responses than did woody forms. The greater responsiveness of the herbaceous forms may be attributed to their more flexible morphology and to their relatively greater proportion of stored plant reserves. Finally, warmer, low arctic sites produced the strongest growth responses, but colder sites produced a greater reproductive response. Greater resource investment in vegetative growth may be a conservative strategy in the Low Arctic, where there is more competition for light, nutrients, or water, and there may be little opportunity for successful germination or seedling development. In contrast, in the High Arctic, heavy investment in producing seed under a higher temperature scenario may provide an opportunity for species to colonize patches of unvegetated ground. The observed differential response to warming suggests that the primary forces driving the response vary across climatic zones, functional groups, and through time."], "title": "Responses of Tundra plants to experimental warming: Meta-analysis of the International Tundra Experiment"},

Starting from year 1765, integrations of the coupled model for 300 years were performed for three scenarios: increasing greenhouse gases only, increasing sulfate-aerosol loading only and the combination of both radiative forcings. The integration with the combined radiative forcings reproduces approximately the observed increases of global mean surface air temperature during the 20th century. Analysis of this integration indicates that both summer dryness and winter wetness occur in middle-to-high latitudes of North America and southern Europe. These features were identified in earlier studies. However, in the southern part of North America where the percentage reduction of soil moisture during summer is quite large, soil moisture is decreased for nearly the entire annual cycle in response to greenhouse warming. A similar observation applies to other semi-arid regions in subtropical to middle latitudes such as central Asia and the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. On the other hand, annual mean runoff is greatly increased in high latitudes because of increased poleward transport of moisture in the warmer model atmosphere. An analysis of the central North American and southern European regions indicates that the time when the change of soil moisture exceeds one standard deviation about the control integration occurs considerably later than that of surface air temperature for a given experiment because the ratio of forced change to natural variability is much smaller for soil moisture compared with temperature. The corresponding lag time for runoff change is even greater than that of either precipitation or soil moisture for the same reason. Also according to the above criterion, the inclusion of the effect of sulfate aerosols in the greenhouse warming experiment delays the noticeable change of soil moisture by several decades. It appears that observed surface air temperature is a better indicator of greenhouse warming than hydrologic quantities such as precipitation, runoff and soil moisture.

A portion of the initiative, the sequestration of greenhouse gases, is the focus of this presentation. Over 4 million acres of bottomland hardwood forests were cleared for agriculture in the Mississippi River Valley in the 1970s. Reestablishing these forests would improve depleted wildlife habitats, serve as wildlife corridors, increase biodiversity, and decrease soil erosion. Also, Louisiana is losing coastal wetlands at a rate of approximately 25 square miles/year. This coastal erosion is due to a number of factors and many efforts are currently underway to address the matter. One such effort is the use of material generated in the dredging of navigational canals; however, this material is low in nutrient value, making the regeneration of marsh grasses more difficult. In addition, bottomland hardwood forests and coastal wetland grasses are excellent 'carbon sinks' because they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in living plant tissue. Entergy Services, Inc. is an electric utility with a service territory that comprises portions of both the Lower Mississippi River Valley and the Gulf of Mexico coastline. This provides an opportunity to positively address both habitat losses noted above while at the same time addressing global warming, forest fragmentation, and biodiversity. Entergy, through its affiliation with the UtiliTree Carbon Company, is participating in projects that will investigate the feasibility of using bottomland hardwood reforestation on cleared marginal farmlands now managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Entergy has also begun a research project with the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Louisiana. The research is a compost demonstration project that will utilize wood waste generated through our tree-trimming program as a compost material that will be mixed with low nutrient dredge material to create new coastal wetlands. Taken together, Entergy's initiatives will be able to address global warming through carbon sequestration, restore fragmented forest habitats, reduce coastal erosion and improve the quality of a vital coastal aquatic nursery habitat. Efforts will be made to manage the created habitats for biodiversity. Pulling all these ideas together creates an effect in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In such a synergy of ideas, there are no losers and the winners are both industry participants and the environment."], "title": "Addressing global warming and biodiversity through forest restoration and coastal wetlands creation"},

In the absence of a full physical theory able to explain the origin of the observed total solar irradiance variations, three different total solar irradiance reconstructions have been used. A total solar irradiance change due to the photospheric effects incorporated in the Willson and Hudson (1988) parameterization, and the newly reconstructed solar total irradiance variations from the solar models of Hoyt and Schatten (1993) and Lean et al.

Our results indicate that while the influence of the orbital forcing on the annual and global mean surface temperature is negligible at the century time scale, the monthly mean response to this forcing can be quite different from one month to another. The modelled global warming due to the three investigated total solar irradiance reconstructions is insufficient to reproduce the observed 20th century warming. Nevertheless, our simulated surface temperature response to the changes in the Sun's radiant energy output suggests that the Gleissberg cycle (\u224388 years) solar forcing should not be neglected in explaining the century-scale climate variations. Finally, spectral analysis seems to point out that the 10- to 12-year oscillations found in the recorded Northern Hemisphere temperature variations from 1700 to 1992 could be unrelated to the solar forcing.

The developed probabilistic model is applied in order to derive local scenarios of extreme high-temperature run events for a large conurbation like the city of Berlin assuming both arbitrary hypothetical and physically based new climate states described by changes in the model parameters (e.g. the mean, the standard deviation and the first-order autocorrelation of the daily maximum temperature time series). As a consequence of a 1.7 \u00b0C increase in the mean as well as a 19% increase in the temperature variability in July as predicted by the climate model ECHAM_1/LSG assuming an unrestricted future increase in the global atmospheric concentration of climate relevant greenhouse gases according to the IPCC Scenario A (`Business as usual') the intensity as well as the persistence of extreme high-temperature run events will rise considerably up to the end of the next century. In particular, intense hot spells characterized by at least five consecutive daily maximum temperatures equaling or exceeding 33 \u00b0C are expected to occur every eight years under the new climate conditions compared to a current repetition time of about 47 years. The potential environmental effects might be a significant increase in the heat-stress-related morbidity and mortality rate, an aggravation of the summer smog situation and a destabilization of the urban ecosystems."], "title": "Assessment of the probability of extreme weather events and their potential effects in large conurbations"},

Climate is an important forcing parameter of landslides and, hence, implications of climate change for landslide activity are of high concern for geomorphological research. The present paper offers a method for assessing climate change impacts on landslide frequency based on general circulation models (GCM). GCM results are downscaled with an empirical-statistical technique to derive local precipitation scenarios. These scenarios are used as input to a simple slope hydrological and stability model. The landslide is defined 'active' if simulated groundwater levels exceed a critical level established with the stability model. Recurrence intervals for landslide activity are obtained by applying a Gumbel regression to the simulated annual maximum groundwater levels. Furthermore, it is shown that indirect climate change impacts as well as changing non-climatic parameters can be important for future landslide frequencies too. The use of three different GCM experiments for the assessment of the activity of a small landslide in SE France did not show a consistent picture of future landslide frequencies. This is due to differences between the GCM experiments but might be enhanced by the limited ability of the applied downscaling technique to carry climate change signals. Finally, some possibilities of improving the approach are outlined and the need for better GCM experiments, which provide the basic input of the approach, is addressed."], "title": "Modelling future landslide activity based on general circulation models"},

The geomorphology of this region typifies that of low-lying, limestone coastlines considered highly susceptible to sea-level rise (e.g., much of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, and low-lying limestone islands throughout the world). This coast is microtidal, shallowly sloping, and has a rate of relative sea-level rise similar to that of eustatic rise. To determine patterns of forest change in relation to sea-level rise, we examined patterns of tree species zonation, tree recruitment, and tree mortality in relation to site elevation and tidal-flooding frequency. To reconstruct histories of forest change in relation to sea-level rise, we estimated age distributions of Sabal palmetto, the most widely distributed tree species at our site, relating age structures of stands to reconstructed histories of tidal flooding in the stands. Finally, to assess the relative roles of flooding stress (hypoxia), salt exposure, and competition from encroaching salt-marsh vegetation in the decline of forest stands, we examined patterns of soil redox potential, groundwater salinity, and density of halophytic vegetation among stands in different stages of decline. Zonation among tree species was related to tidal-flooding frequency. For most trees, seedlings were absent from the most frequently flooded stands in which the species occurred. Reconstructed flooding histories of stands and age estimates for S. palmetto suggest that many decades elapse between cessation of regeneration and local elimination of a tree species. Even during the relatively short duration of the study (4 yr), however, composition of some stands changed in the direction predicted from species zonation and sea-level rise. Forest understory replacement by halophytic vegetation appeared to follow, rather than cause, failure of tree regeneration. Tidal flooding rarely produced severe reducing conditions in soil, but groundwater salinity was correlated with tidal-flooding frequency. Forest retreat in this system, therefore, involves the development of relict (non-regenerating) stands of different tree species at different flooding frequencies. Exposure to salt appears to be the major cause of tree regeneration failure, with flooding stress and interference from marsh vegetation playing minor or negligible roles. These interactions differ somewhat from those on deltaic coasts or coasts with high freshwater outflows, where flooding stress may play a larger role in regeneration failure, and from sandy coasts, where erosion may play a larger role in forest retreat. Regardless of the cause of tree regeneration failure, the development of relict stands may be a general forest response to sea-level rise."], "title": "Sea-level rise and coastal forest retreat on the west coast of Florida, USA"},

Such changes in wind pattern, which have favourable effects on the frequency of coastal flooding, may be due, at least in part, to interdecadal climate variability. However, the persistence of certain trends suggests a climatic shift, with, in particular, less-frequent situations, with strong atmospheric pressure gradients between highs in central/eastern Europe and lows in southern Italy or in the Adriatic area.

Smith's philosophical outlook finds its modern reflection in the notion of commensurability, the idea that social realities, amongst other things, can be indexed by a unitary measure of value. Economic cost-benefit analysis takes commensurability to its logical extreme by claiming that, for instance, the question whether to construct another London airport can be decided by applying a strict commercial analysis, attributing costs and prices to the whole range of environmental and human factors (but what value to place on a Norman church located in the path of the proposed runway?). A particularly intractable aspect of cost-benefit analysis is that, since any large investment project will almost certainly create benefits for some people and disbenefits for others, the analysis must include invidious interpersonal comparisons of utility - and while it might be equitable for those who benefit from such a project to compensate those who are disadvantaged by it, this in practice rarely happens. Finally, global warming due to the emission of greenhouse gases is examined, and it is shown how cost-benefit analysis applied to this situation turns out to be an even more complicated and an even less satisfactory approach.

For all spatial scales, the model with water vapor feedback has more low-frequency (timescale \u2265 2 yr) surface temperature variability than the one without. Thus water vapor feedback is positive in the context of the model's unperturbed variability. In addition, water vapor feedback is more effective the longer the timescale of the surface temperature anomaly and the larger its spatial scale. To understand the role of water vapor feedback in global warming, two 500-yr integrations were also performed in which CO", " was doubled in both model configurations. The final surface global warming in the model with water vapor feedback is 3.38\u00b0C, while in the one without it is only 1.05\u00b0C. However, the model's water vapor feedback has a larger impact on surface warming in response to a doubling of CO", " than it does on internally generated, low-frequency, global-mean surface temperature anomalies. Water vapor feedback's strength therefore depends on the type of temperature anomaly it affects. The authors found that the degree to which a surface temperature anomaly penetrates into the troposphere is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of its associated water vapor feedback. The more the anomaly penetrates, the stronger the feedback. It is also shown that the apparent impact of water vapor feedback is altered by other feedback mechanisms, such as albedo and cloud feedback. The sensitivity of the results to this fact is examined. Finally, the authors compare the local and global-mean surface temperature time series from both unperturbed variability experiments to the observed record. The experiment without water vapor feedback does not have enough global-scale variability to reproduce the magnitude of the variability in the observed global-mean record, whether or not one removes the warming trend observed over the past century. In contrast, the amount of variability in the experiment with water vapor feedback is comparable to that of the global-mean record, provided the observed warming trend is removed. Thus, the authors are unable to simulate the observed levels of variability without water vapor feedback."], "title": "The role of water vapor feedback in unperturbed climate variability and global warming"}]
