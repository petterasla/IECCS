This paper considers future emission trends and examines the potential effectiveness of carbon taxes in controlling emissions. It also discusses the conflict between economic growth in the less wealthy nations and the global emissions of carbon dioxide. It concludes with some suggestions as to how this conflict might be at least partially resolved.",,"Carbon taxes; Economic growths; Emission trends; Global emissions; Greenhouse emissions; KYOTO protocol; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Emission control",,,,,,"(1998) Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, , United Nations; World GHG Emissions Flowchart, , www.wri.org/chart/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-flow-chart, World Resources Institute, at; The World fact Book Central Intelligence Agency, 2008, US Governmenthttp://data.un.org/Search.aspx?q=gdp, UN data United Nations Organisation, 2008 atCountry Energy Profiles Energy Information Administration, , http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/country/index.cfm, US Government, at; www.nationmaster.com/index.php, atChanges in GHG Emissions From 1994 to 2004 for Annex I Parties, , United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","Covey, G.; 91 Woodlands Drive, Thornlands, QLD 4164, Australia",,,,,,,,10386807,,APJOE,,"English","Appita J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-72749083663
