However, little effort is devoted to predict forest dynamics in the high elevation areas, although they have the sensitive response to global climate change. In the present study, based on a modified height-diameter function, we developed a new version (FAREAST-GFSM) of the forest patch model, FAREAST for simulating the changes of subalpine forests. The observed data from the Gongga Mt. Alpine Station were also used to test model precision. With the improved performance of FAREAST-GFSM, we explored the impact of three warming scenarios on subalpine forest on the eastern Tibetan plateau within a 100-year period. The study result indicates that the effects of climate change were evident on subalpine forests in the high elevation areas. The response of different species to the warming climate might eventually transform the subalpine Abies fabric forest into Betula utilis forest similar to that which is now widely distributed in the eastern Tibetan Plateau mountainous areas with the relatively lower elevation. Subalpine forests could move to higher and colder areas, which are currently tundra. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climatic changes; Eastern Tibetan plateau; Forest dynamics; Forest patch model; Forest structure; Gap model; Global climate changes; High elevation; Mountainous area; Observed data; Potential impacts; Test models; Warming climate; Climate models; Forestry; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; community composition; data set; deciduous forest; diameter; ecological modeling; elevation; forest ecosystem; gap dynamics; geographical distribution; global climate; height; mountain region; numerical model; plant community; precision; subalpine environment; succession; tundra; warming; Climates; Forestry; Mathematical Models; Mountains; Species Identification; Tibet; Tree Dimensions; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Abies; Betula utilis",,,,,,"(2004) Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , ACIA (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment), Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Botkin, D.B., (1993) Forest Dynamics: An Ecological Model, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Botkin, D.B., Janak, J.F., Wallis, J.R., Some ecological consequences of a computer model of forest growth (1972) J Ecol, 60, pp. 849-872; Bugmann, H., A simplified forest model to study species composition along climate gradients (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 2055-2074; Bugmann, H., An efficient method for estimating the steady state species composition of forest gap models (1997) Can J For Res, 27, pp. 551-556; Bugmann, H., Sensitivity of forests in the European Alps to future climatic change (1997) Clim Res, 8, pp. 35-44; Bugmann, H., A review of forest gap models (2001) Clim Change, 51, pp. 259-305; Bugmann, H., Pfister, C., Impacts of interannual climate variability on past and future forest composition (2000) Reg Environ Change, 1, pp. 112-125; Bugmann, H., Yan, X.D., Sykes, M.T., Martin, P., Lindner, M., Desanker, P.V., Cumming, S.G., A comparison of forest gap models structure and behavior (1996) Clim Change, 34, pp. 289-313; Cheng, G.W., Luo, J., Successional features and dynamic simulation of sub-alpine forest in the Gongga Mountain, China (2002) Acta Ecol Sin, 22, pp. 1049-1056; Cheng, G.W., Yu, X.X., Zhao, Y.T., (2004) Hydrological Circulation and Mathematical Simulation of Mountain Forest Ecosystem, , Beijing: Science; Cohen, Y., Pastor, J., The responses of a forest model to serial correlations of global warming (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 1161-1165; Deng, H.P., Wu, Z.F., Response of broadleaved Pinus koraiensis forests in Xiaoxinganling Mt. to global change - a dynamic modeling (2000) Chin J Appl Ecol, 11, pp. 43-46; Ellenberg, H., (1986) Vegetation Mitteleuropas Mit Den Alpen in ökologischer Sicht, , 4th edn., Stuttgart: Eugen Ulmer; Flato, G.M., Boer, G.J., Warming asymmetry in climate change simulations (2001) Geophys Res Lett, 28, pp. 195-198; Fischlin, A., Gyalistras, D., Assessing impacts of climatic change on forests in the Alps (1997) Clim Change, 6, pp. 19-37; Foley, J.A., Costa, M.H., Delire, C., Ramankutty, N., Snyder, P., Green surprise?
