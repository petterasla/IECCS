The modified two-flow equation approximate of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) with a collimated or specular component is used to calculate the sensitivity of the calculated irradiance reflectance on the inclusion of solar zenith angle, wind speed, shape factors, chlorophyll-a concentration, water depth, and bottom type.","Absorption; Backscatter; Bottom reflectance; Bottom types; Hydrologic optics; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Modeling; Shape factors; Simulation; Water quality; Water surface reflectance","Hydrologic optics; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Water surface reflectance; Backscattering; Chlorophyll; Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Mathematical models; Sensitivity analysis; Water quality",,,,,,"Bostater, C., Ma, W., McNally, T., Gimond, M., Lamb, A.P., Application of an optical remote sensing model (1995) Proceedings of the European Optical Society and SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering (EUROPTO), the European Symposium on Satellite Remote Sensing, , Paris, France; Bostater, C., Huddleston, L., Semmler, C., Mieles, J., An iterative algorithm for layered optical remote sensing reflectance modeling of natural waters with depth dependent aquatic constituent concentrations (2002) Proceedings of the European Optical Society and SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering (EUROPTO), Remote Sensing of the Ocean and Sea Ice 2002, , Agia Pelagia, Crete, Greece; Perovich, D.K., (1989) A Two-stream Multiplayer, Spectral Radiative Transfer Model for Sea Ice, p. 20. , U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory; Preisendorfer, R., (1978) Hydrologic Optics, , Honolulu, HI, NOAA/ERL; Aas, E., Two-stream irradiance model for deep waters (1987) Applied Optics, 26 (11), pp. 2095-2101; Stavn, R.H., Weidemann, A.D., Shape factors, two-flow models, and the problem of irradiance inversion in estimating optical parameters (1989) Limnology and Oceanography, 34, pp. 1426-1441; McCormick, N.J., Francisco, P.W., Radiative transfer two-stream shape factors for ocean optics (1995) Applied Optics, 34 (27), pp. 6248-6255; Hojerslev, N.K., Analytic remote-sensing optical algorithms requiring simple and practical field parameter inputs (2001) Applied Optics, 40 (27), pp. 4870-4874; Gimond, M., Comprehensive assessment of the two-flow model's shape factors in aquatic environments (2005) Applied Optics, 44 (6), pp. 966-975; Bostater, C., Gimond, M., Using aircraft based high resolution reflectance signatures and specific absorption coefficients to remotely estimate coastal water quality (1996) Proc. 2 nd Intl Airborne Remote Sensing Conference and Exhibition, , San Francisco, California","Huddleston, L.H.; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Dept.
