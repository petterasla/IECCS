A total of 83 fish species and 63,328 individuals were recorded over 120 1-h visual censuses composed of three 2×200 m transects. The number of both total individuals (abundance) and species (richness) were strongly correlated with the bottom-water temperature. Species richness was greatest in summer (July-September), with 10-20 species per 400 m2, when the sea-bottom temperature was highest (24-28°C), and lowest in winter (January-March), with 1-8 species per 400 m2, when the temperature was lowest (10-12°C). Five species, i.e., rockfish, Sebastes inermis, wrasse, Pseudolabrus sieboldi, two species of goby, Acentrogobius pflaumii and Tridentiger trigonocephalus, and pygmy filefish, Rudarius ercodes, were frequently observed and present in more than 200 of the total of 360 total transects. While the presence of most fish species was dependent on water temperature, some species were independent of water temperature, including anchovy, Engraulis japonicus, S. inermis, wasp fish, Hypodytes rubripinnis, A. pflaumii and pufferfish, Takifugu poecilonotus. Jack mackerel, Trachurus japonicus, was the most abundant fish, being most typically seen from spring through autumn, with a total of 21,850 individuals observed over the whole census period. Some species showed strong annual fluctuations in abundance. The interannual stability in fish abundance and species richness was probably because the fish assemblage was composed of a sufficiently large number of species, but with the number of each species fluctuating over time. A comparison of the present survey to one in 1970-72 revealed that over the last 30 years southern fish species have significantly increased whereas those indigenous to northern waters have decreased. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Community ecology; Fish assemblage; Global warming; Species composition; Subtidal fish fauna; Underwater visual census","abundance; annual variation; census; community ecology; comparative study; global warming; perciform; seasonal variation; species richness; subtidal environment; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Honshu; Japan; Wakasa Bay; Acentrogobius pflaumii; Callogobius atratus; Engraulidae; Engraulis japonicus; Hypodytes rubripinnis; Monacanthus setifer; Pseudolabrus sieboldi; Rudarius ercodes; Sebastes inermis; Takifugu poecilonotus; Tetraodontidae; Trachurus japonicus; Tridentiger trigonocephalus",,,,,,"Almada, V.C., Faria, C., Temporal variation of rocky intertidal resident fish assemblages - Patterns and possible mechanisms with a note on sampling protocols (2004) Rev Fish Biol Fisheries, 14, pp. 239-250; Beare, D.J., Burns, F., Greig, A., Jones, E.G., Peach, K., Kienzle, M., McKenzie, E., Reid, D.G., Long-term increases in prevalence of North Sea fishes having southern biogeographic affinities (2004) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 284, pp. 269-278; Bohnsack, J.A., Resiliency of reef fish communities in the Florida Keys following a January 1977 hypothermal fish kill (1983) Env Biol Fish, 9, pp. 41-53; Bradshaw, W.E., Holzapfel, C.M., Genetic shift in photoperiodic response correlated with global warming (2001) PNAS, 98, pp. 14509-14511; Choat, J.H., Bellwood, D.R., Sale, P.F., Reef fishes: Their history and evolution (1991) Ecology of Fishes on Coral Reefs, pp. 39-66. , Academic Press San Diego; Choat, J.H., Ayling, A.M., Schiel, D.R., Temporal and spatial variation in an island fish fauna (1988) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 121, pp. 91-111; Clark, B.M., Bennett, B.A., Lamberth, S.J., Temporal variations in surf zone fish assemblages from False Bay, South Africa (1996) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 131, pp. 35-47; Eaton, J.G., Scheller, R.M., Effects of climate warming on fish thermal habitat in streams of the United States (1996) Limnol Oceanogr, 41, pp. 1109-1115; Ebeling, A.W., Hixon, M.A., Sale, P.F., Tropical and temperate reef fishes: Comparison of community structures (1991) Ecology of Fishes on Coral Reefs, pp. 509-563. , Academic Press San Diego; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Friedlander, A.M., Parrish, J.D., Temporal dynamics of fish communities on an exposed shoreline in Hawaii (1998) Env Biol Fish, 53, pp. 1-18; Gibson, R.N., Ansell, A.D., Robb, L., Seasonal and annual variations in abundance and species composition of fish and macrocrustacean communities on a Scottish sandy beach (1993) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 98, pp. 89-105; Hiscock, K., Southward, A., Tittley, I., Hawkins, S., Effects of changing temperature on benthic marine life in Britain and Ireland (2004) Aquatic Conserv: Mar Freshw Ecosyst, 14, pp. 333-362; Inoh, A., (2004) Water Quality and Fishery Production in Maizuru Bay in Recent 30 Years, , MSc.
