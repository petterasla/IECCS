Given the fact that no dramatic tectonic movement had taken place, this historical warming episode mirrors the present warming event induced mostly by human activities. Proxy data indicate that the MMCO had a global mean surface temperature of ~3-4°C higher than the present, equivalent to the warming predicted for the next century by the mid-range scenarios of the IPCC Fourth Report (AR4). With this comparable magnitude of warming, it is therefore of scientific interest to examine whether or not the present warming is similar to the MMCO warming. Since the MMCO boundary conditions such as paleogeography and paleobathymetry were not greatly different from today, contentious scientific issues on possible forcing mechanisms can be assessed. The MMCO climate was simulated using the latest National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model CAM3.1 and Land Model CLM3.0 coupled to a slab ocean model. Two simulations were conducted, the MG700 with a near-present equator-pole meridional sea-surface temperature (SST) gradient and a CO2 level of 700 ppmv and the HG350 with a higher equator-pole meridional SST gradient and a CO2 level of 350 ppmv. These two simulations give the closest proxy global mean surface temperature of 18.4°C with a difference of ±0.6°C. This study analyses these two simulations and provides an insight into possible mechanisms of the MMCO. Results show that the north and south poles respond differently to a 50% reduction in CO2 from the upper bound value of 700 ppmv (an approximate doubling of the present CO2) and a change in equator-pole meridional SST gradient. The Arctic response to a 50% reduction in CO2 is balanced by a 50% decrease in surface temperature but shows no response to the increase in equator-pole meridional SST gradient. The Antarctic situation is opposite to the Arctic: the western Antarctic's response to the increase in the equator-pole meridional SST gradient is nearly balanced by a doubling of the maximum surface temperature, but shows no response to a 50% reduction in CO2; the eastern Antarctic shows a weak response to either a 50% reduction in CO2 or to an increase in the equator-pole meridional SST gradient. This may explain why the Arctic warms much more than the Antarctic in the MMCO and the decoupling of CO2 with temperature as determined by the proxy SST. © 2010 Geological Society of Australia.","Middle Miocene Climate Optimum; Modelling; Paleoclimate","analog model; atmosphere-ocean coupling; carbon dioxide; climate forcing; climate modeling; climate variation; computer simulation; future prospect; global warming; human activity; Miocene; paleoatmosphere; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; paleogeography; proxy climate record; sea surface temperature; tectonic setting; temperature gradient; Antarctica; Arctic",,,,,,"Abbot, D.S., Tziperman, E., Sea ice, high-latitude convection, and equable climates (2008) Geophysical Research Letters, 35, pp. L03702. , doi:10.1029/2007GL032286; Cerling, T.E., Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: Evidence from Cenozoic and Mesozoic paleosols (1991) American Journal of Science, 291, pp. 377-400; Christophel, D.C., Evolution of the Australian flora through the Tertiary (1989) Plant Systematics and Evolution, 162, pp. 63-78; Collins, W.D., Rasch, P.J., Boville, B.A., Hack, J.J., McCaa, J.R., Williamson, D.L., Briegleb, B.P., Zhang, M., The formulation and atmospheric simulation of the Community Atmosphere Model Version 3 (CAM3) (2006) Journal of Climate, 19, pp. 2144-2161; Doran, P.T., Priscu, J.C., Lyons, W.B., Walsh, J.E., Fountain, A.G., McNight, D.M., Moorhead, D.L., Parsons, A.N., Antarctic climate cooling and terrestrial ecosystem response (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 517-520; Flower, B.P., Kennett, J.P., The Middle Miocene climatic transition: East Antarctic ice sheet development, deep ocean circulation and global carbon cycling (1994) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 108, pp. 537-555; Graversen, R.G., Mauritsen, T., Tjernstrom, M., Kallen, E., Svensson, G., Vertical structure of recent Arctic warming (2008) Nature, p. 541. , doi:10.1038/nature06502; Haq, B.U., Phanerozoic cycles of sea-level change on the Arabian Platform (2005) GeoArabia, 10, pp. 127-160; Herold, N., You, Y., Müller, R.D., Seton, M., Climate model sensitivity to changes in Miocene paleotopography (2009) Australian Journal of Earth Sciences, 56, pp. 1049-1059; (2007) IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4): Working Groups I, II, III and Synthesis Reports, , http://www.ipcc.ch/, IPCC (INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE); Knight, J., Kennedy, J.J., Folland, C., Harris, G., Jones, G.S., Palmer, S., Parker, D., Stott, P., Do global temperature trends over the last decade falsify climate prediction?
