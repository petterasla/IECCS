Gas hydrate is an ice-like solid consisting of gas molecules, commonly methane, trapped in a cage of water molecules. Global estimates of the methane content of natural gas hydrate are very large, potentially enormous. Such large quantities of gas hydrate could be important as a clean energy source, as a control in global climate, and as a factor in seafloor slumps and slides. Gas hydrate occurs only in water depths greater than about 600 m at temperate latitudes, but occurs on land and in shallow water in the Arctic. The formation mechanisms of gas hydrates are only partly understood. Gas hydrate appears to be formed usually by migrating fluids carrying biologically generated methane upward to regions of sufficiently low temperature and high pressure where the hydrate is stable. Quantitative aspects of this formation model need testing, however, and questions remain about the sources and sinks for methane, and the amount that can reach the atmosphere. In Canada, gas hydrates are found on most of its continental margins, notably on the continental slope off Vancouver Island and in the Mackenzie Delta-Beaufort Sea region. A drilling program off Vancouver Island would examine gas hydrates in a well-studied accretionary sedimentary wedge; such sediments appear to be the most common environment in which hydrates are found globally. Drilling for gas hydrate offshore in the Canadian Arctic, perhaps using an alternative drilling platform, would complement a current onshore Arctic gas hydrate drilling program in the permafrost environment. The Arctic land and shallow sea hydrate are important because such hydrate is especially susceptible to global climate change.",,"Climate control; High pressure effects; Low temperature effects; Methane; Natural gas; Underwater drilling; Clean energy sources; Gas hydrates; Deep Sea Drilling Project; gas hydrate; methane; natural gas; Ocean Drilling Program; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Pacific Ocean",,,,,,"Becker, K., Davis, E.E., CORK reveals huge fluxes in off-axis hydrologic circulation (1998) JOI/USSAC Newsletter, 11, pp. 12-15; Becker, K., Fisher, A.T., Davis, E.E., The CORK experiment in Hole 949C: Long-term observations of pressure and temperature in the Barbados accretionary prism (1997) Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Scientific Results, 156, pp. 247-252; Becker, K., (1998) Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program Initial Reports, 174 B, pp. 13-23. , Site 395; Becker, K., Logging while drilling and advanced CORKs in the Nankai Trough (2000) Ocean Drilling Program, 196. , Leg 196 Scientific Prospectus, 61 p; Davis, E.E., Becker, K., Tidal pumping of fluids within and from the oceanic crust: New observations and opportunities for sampling the crustal hydrosphere (1999) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 172, pp. 141-149; Davis, E.E., Becker, K., Formation temperatures and pressures in a sedimented rift hydrothermal system: Ten months of CORK observations, Holes 857D and 858G (1994) Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Scientific Results, 139, pp. 649-666; Davis, E.E., Becker, K., Borehole observatories record driving forces for hydrothermal circulation in young oceanic crust (1998) EOS, Transactions of the American Geophysical Union, 79 (31), pp. 369-370; Davis, E.E., Becker, K., Pettigrew, T., Carson, B., Macdonald, R., CORK: A hydrologic seal and downhole observatory for deep-ocean boreholes (1992) Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Initial Reports, 139, pp. 43-53; Davis, E.E., Becker, K., Wang, K., Carson, B., Long-term observations of pressure and temperature in Hole 992B, Cascadia accretionary prism (1995) Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Scientific Results, 146, pp. 299-311; Davis, E.E., Wang, K., Becker, K., Thomson, R.E., Formation-scale hydraulic and mechanical properties of oceanic crust inferred from pore pressure response to periodic seafloor loading (2000) Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, pp. 13423-13435; Fisher, A.T., Zwart, G., Relation between permeability and effective stress along a plate-boundary fault, Barbados accretionary complex (1996) Geology, 24, pp. 307-310. , ODP scientific party; Foucher, J.P., Henry, P., Harmengnies, F., Long-term observations of pressure and temperature in ODP Hole 948D.
