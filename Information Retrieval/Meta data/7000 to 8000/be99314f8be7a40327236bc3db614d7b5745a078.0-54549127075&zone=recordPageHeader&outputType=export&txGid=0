Rain-use efficiency (RUE) is an important measure for acquiring this understanding. However, little is known about the response pattern of RUE for the largest contiguous natural grassland region of the world, the Eurasian Steppe. Here we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of ANPP and RUE and their key driving factors based on a long-term data set from 21 natural arid and semiarid ecosystem sites across the Inner Mongolia steppe region in northern China. Our results showed that, with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP), (1) ANPP increased while the interannual variability of ANPP declined, (2) plant species richness increased and the relative abundance of key functional groups shifted predictably, and (3) RUE increased in space across different ecosystems but decreased with increasing annual precipitation within a given ecosystem. These results clearly indicate that the patterns of both ANPP and RUE are scale dependent, and the seemingly conflicting patterns of RUE in space vs. time suggest distinctive underlying mechanisms, involving interactions among precipitation, soil N, and biotic factors. Also, while our results supported the existence of a common maximum RUE, they also indicated that its value could be substantially increased by altering resource availability, such as adding nitrogen. Our findings have important implications for understanding and predicting ecological impacts of global climate change and for management practices in arid and semiarid ecosystems in the Inner Mongolia steppe region and beyond. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","ANPP; Arid and semiarid land; Ecosystem management; Eurasian steppe; Inner Mongolia grassland; Mean annual precipitation; Nitrogen addition; Plant functional group composition; Rain-use efficiency","arid environment; ecosystem management; net primary production; nutrient availability; plateau; primary production; rainwater; semiarid region; water use efficiency; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Mongolia; Nei Monggol; nitrogen; rain; article; China; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; time; China; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Nitrogen; Plants; Rain; Time Factors",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Austin, A.T., Differential effects of precipitation on production and decomposition along a rainfall gradient in Hawaii (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 328-338; Bai, Y.F., Influence of seasonal distribution of precipitation on primary productivity of Stipa krylovii community (1999) Acta Plrytoecologica Sinica, 23, pp. 155-160; Bai, Y.F., Han, X.G., Wu, J.G., Chen, Z.Z., Li, L.H., Ecosystem stability and compensatory effects in the Inner Mongolia grassland (2004) Nature, 431, pp. 181-184; Bai, Y.F., Li, L.H., Huang, J.H., Chen, Z.Z., The influence of plant diversity and functional composition on ecosystem stability of four Stipa communities in the Inner Mongolia Plateau (2001) Acta Botanica Sinica, 43, pp. 280-287; Bai, Y.F., Li, L.H., Wang, Q.B., Zhang, L.X., Zhang, Y., Chen, Z.Z., Changes in plant species diversity and productivity along gradients of precipitation and elevation in the Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia (2000) Acta Phytoecologica Sinica, 24, pp. 667-673; Bai, Y.F., Wu, J.G., Pan, Q.M., Huang, J.H., Wang, Q.B., Li, F.S., Buyantuyev, A., Han, X.G., Positive linear relationship between productivity and diversity: Evidence from the Eurasian steppe (2007) Journal of Applied Ecology, 44, pp. 1023-1034; Bai, Y.F., Zhang, L.X., Zhang, Y., Chen, Z.Z., Changes in plant functional composition along gradients of precipitation and temperature in the Xilin river basin.
