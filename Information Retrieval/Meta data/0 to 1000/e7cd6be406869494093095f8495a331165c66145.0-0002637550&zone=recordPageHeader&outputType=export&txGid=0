A general model of an annual reproductive cycle is developed and presented in two forms for semelparous and iteroparous organisms. 2. 2. In the model a fixed period for spawning implies a fixed phase relationship between all components of the cycle and those external variables with an annual component. Causal relationships cannot be established by observations of concurence. 3. 3. The physiological basis of causal relationship is being established for a number of marine invertebrate groups and some polychaete case histories are reviewed. 4. 4. An important role for endogenous timing mechanisms that interact with external variables including temperature but also seasonal photoperiod and other factors is established. 5. 5. An increase in mean sea temperature would cause a change in the temperature phase relationships of annual reproductive cycles when photoperiod has a significant role in the timing mechanism. 6. 6. Local variation in the responses to environmental signals are expected in populations in different parts of the geographical range. Gene flow would provide a mechanism by which populations would respond to reductions of fitness arising from the changed phase relationships that are implied by global warming. © 1995.","biogeography; Breeding cycles; Crustacea; Echinodermata; fitness; global warming; models; Mollusca; photoperiod; Polychaeta; proximate cause of reproduction; reproduction; reproductive synchrony; spawning; temperature; ultimate cause of reproduction",,,,,,,"Baert, Slomianny, Heterosynthetic origin of the major yolk protein, vitellin, in a nereid, Perinereis cultrifera, (Polychaete annelid) (1987) Comp.
