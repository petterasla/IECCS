How can a world of 10 to 12 billion people be provided with adequate supplies of energy, cleanly, safely and substantially? There is a growing consensus that renewable energy sources will be a very important part of the answer. The growing interest in ""renewables"" has been prompted in part, by increasing concern over the pollution, resource depletion and possible climate change implications of our continuing use of conventionalfossil and nuclear fuels. But recent technological developments have also improved the cost-effectiveness of many of the renewables, making their economic prospects look increasingly attractive. It describes the achievement and progress made in hydropower, biomass conversion, geothermal, solar thermal technology, wind energy conversion and the increasing usage of photovoltaics. It is evident that global warming is setting in and is going to change the climate as well as the terrain of many countries unless drastic measures are taken. The Kyoto meeting emphasized the importance of limiting CO2 emissions and to abide by some form of agreement to reduce emissions. Present study concludes that renewable energy penetration into the energy market is much faster than was expected in recent years and by 2030, 15-20 percent of our prime energy will be met by renewable energy.",,"Biomass; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Energy conversion; Nuclear fuels; Pollution; Wind power; Biomass conversion; Photovoltaics; Resource depletion; Solar thermal technology; Renewable energy resources",,,,,,"Ackermann, T., Söder, L., Wind energy technology and current status: A review (2000) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 4, pp. 315-374; (2001) Global Wind Energy Market Report, , http://www.awea.org; Birol, F., Argiri, M., World energy prospects to 2020 (1999) Energy, 24, pp. 905-918; Brown, C.A., (2001) Wind Power in China., pp. 24-29. , Refocus April; Boyle, G., (1998) Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future, , Oxford University Press: Oxford; Cavaney, R., At the millennium: A new dawn for the petroleum industry?
