Aerial sampling was carried out in smoke plumes from 1-ha prescribed burns in mature jack pine stands. The three sampled burns resulted in crown fires, with fuel consumption from 4.2 to 5.8 kg·m-2. Accumulation and coarse mode aerosol (&gt;0.1 μm) was quantified using a passive cavity aerosol spectrometer probe and cascade impactor. The number median diameter of particles in the smoke plume was 0.29 μm, and the peak number and cross-sectional area density occurred around a particle size of 0.4 μm. More than 99% of particles sized had diameters &lt;1.2 μm. Aerosol from flaming combustion was coarser than that from the smouldering phase, with number median diameters of 0.3 and 0.2 μm, respectively.",,"Combustion; Data acquisition; Fires; Forestry; Fuel consumption; Global warming; Particle size analysis; Sampling; Spectrometers; Thermal plumes; Cascade impactors; Crown fires; Smoke plumes; Aerosols; aerosol; boreal forest; combustion; forest fire; global warming; Aerosols; Combustion; Data Processing; Forest Fires; Meteorology; Plumes; Pinus banksiana",,,,,,"Charlson, R.J., Schwartz, S.E., Hales, J.M., Cess, R.D., Coakley, J.A., Hansen, J.E., Hofmann, D.F., Climate forcing by anthropogenic aerosols (1992) Science, 255, pp. 423-430; Conny, J.M., Slater, J.F., Black carbon and organic carbon in aerosol particles from crown fires in the Canadian boreal forest (2002) J.
