It will examine the status of technology in the transportation sector and the penetration of that technology in both the industrialized and developing countries. The barriers and constraints to technological progress and the wider dissemination of existing technology may be grouped under five headings: The high priority given to mobility by all peoples - it is seen as the most important attribute of economic progress after achieving adequate provision for food and shelter. The structure of urbanization in the 20th century - which has been based largely on an assumption of personal mobility and/or the availability of transportation infrastructure: roads, public transport, etc. The rapid growth in demand for leisure as a consequence of: (a) the increase in the non-working population of the industrialized countries as life expectancy has increased; (b) the reduction in both retirement age and working hours as technology advances have allowed more goods and services to be provided with substantially lower labour inputs. The desire for greater personal comfort and independence as economic circumstances improve. Institutional barriers to the transfer of technology. These problem areas will be reviewed and some general proposals put forward for enhancing the transfer of technology and resolving some of the sociopolitical issues.",,"Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Industrial economics; Technology transfer; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrialized countries; Institutional barriers; Less developed countries (LDCs); Urbanization; Motor transportation",,,,,,,"Clegg, M.W.; ETE 21, Ascot, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,01433369,,IJVDD,,"English","Int J Veh Des",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026959502
