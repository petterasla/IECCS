Man-made CO2 emissions contribute approximately 63% of greenhouse gases and the cement industry is responsible for approximately 5% of CO2 emissions emitting nearly 900 kg of CO2 per 1000 kg of cement. CO2 from a cement plant was captured and purified to 98% using the monoethanolamine (MEA) based absorption process. The capture cost was $51 per tonne of CO2 captured, representing approximately 90% of total cost. Steam was the main operating cost representing 39% of the total capture cost. Switching from coal to natural gas reduces CO2 emissions by about 18%. At normal load, about 36 MW of waste heat is available for recovery to satisfy the parasitic heat requirements of MEA process; however, it is very difficult to recover.","Aspen Plus; Cement plant; CO2 capture; Economic evaluation; Icarus; MEA; Process simulation","Absorption; Cement plants; Economics; Scrubbers; Waste heat utilization; Economic evaluation; Monoethanolamine; Process simulation; Carbon dioxide; adsorption; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cement; industrial technology; industrial waste; natural gas",,,,,,"Afshin, M., Collas, P., Blain, D., Ha, C., Liang, C., Mcdonald, L., (2004) Canada's Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2002, , Greenhouse Gas Division, Environment Canada, Ottawa, Ontario; Alie, C., Backham, L., Croiset, E., Douglas, P.L., Simulation of CO2 capture using MEA scrubbing: A flowsheet decomposition method (2005) Energy Conversion Management, 46 (2), pp. 475-487; (2003) Aspen Plus User Guide, , Aspen Plus Cambridge, Aspen Technology Limited, Massachusetts; Asrarita, G., Marrucci, G., Gioia, F., The influence of carbonation ratio and total amine concentration on carbon dioxide absorbtion in aqueous monoethanolamine solutions (1964) Chem.
