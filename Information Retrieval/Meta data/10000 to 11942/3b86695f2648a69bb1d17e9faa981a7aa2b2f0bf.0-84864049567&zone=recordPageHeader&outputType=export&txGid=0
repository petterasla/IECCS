To manage such consequences, dedicated actions for resilience are needed and the process of adaptation is the key that has to be carried out at a regional level. The challenge at this level is not only to assess vulnerabilities and risks to each ecosystem, but also to develop policies to adapt so as to achieve sustainability. In this paper, we focus on the ecosystem of water and study the different impacts on it from the perspective of regional Australia. We then propose a digital ecosystem-based architecture in a multisystem approach, which can be utilised for the process of water sustainability adaptation in regional Australia.
