Landfills, the most common means to dispose of municipal solid waste (MSW), lead to the conversion of the organic waste to biogas, containing about 50% methane, a very active greenhouse gas (GHG). One unit of methane has a global warming potential of 21 computed for a 100-year horizon or 56 computed for 20 years. The waste sector in Israel contributes 13% of total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions for a time horizon of 100 years (for a time horizon of 20 years, the waste sector contribution equals to more than 25% of total GHG emissions). The ultimate goal is to minimize the amount of methane (CH4) by converting it to CO2. This can be achieved by physicochemical means (e.g., landfill gas flare, incineration) or by biological processes (e.g., composting, anaerobic digestion). Since the waste in Israel has a high organic material content, it was found that the most cost-effective means to treat the degradable organic components is by aerobic composting (investment of less than US$ 10 to reduce emission of one ton CO2 equivalent per year). Another benefit of this technology is the ability to implement it within a short period. The suggested approach, which should be implemented especially in developing countries, could reduce a significant amount of GHG at relatively low cost and short time. The development of a national policy for proper waste treatment can be a significant means to abate GHG emissions in the short term, enabling a gain in time to develop other means for the long run. In addition, the use of CO2 quotas will credit the waste sector and will promote profitable proper waste management.","Compost; External costs; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Waste management","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon monoxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Land fill; Methane; Public policy; Sustainable management; Solid wastes; biogas; carbon dioxide; methane; emission control; greenhouse gas; solid waste; waste management; compost; cost effectiveness analysis; developing country; greenhouse effect; Israel; landfill; physical chemistry; review; solid waste management; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Methane; Organic Chemicals; Policy Making; Public Policy; Refuse Disposal; Volatilization; Israel",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Methane, 74-82-8; Organic Chemicals",,,,"Augenstein, D., Economics, 'externalities' and landfill gas energy (1997) Proceedings, Sardinia 97, 6th international landfill symposium, 2, pp. 650-658. , T.
