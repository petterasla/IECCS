Assuming a doubling in CO 2 concentration (denoted 2CO 2), basin-scale scenarios for precipitation and other hydrometeorologic variables were generated from the existing general circulation model (GCM) results. The generated temperature and precipitation scenarios were input to the NWS-PC model to generate the corresponding streamflow scenarios over the Geum river basin. A reservoir simulation model for Daecheong Dam in the Geum river basin has been developed using the object-oriented simulation environment, STELLA. For each streamflow scenario, the performance of the reservoir was assessed in terms of reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability. Although the simulation results are heavily dependent on the choice of climate change scenarios, the following conclusions can be made: the future streamflow over Daecheong Dam tends to decrease during the dry period, which seriously increases competitive water use issues; and flood control issues predominate under the 2CO 2-High case. © 2005 International Water Resources Association.","Climate change; GCM; Global warming; Reservoir simulation model","Geum",,,,,,"Hashimoto, T., Stedinger, J., Loucks, P., Reliability, Resilience, and Vulnerability Criteria for Water Resource System Performance Evaluation (1982) Water Resources Research, 18 (1), pp. 14-20; Kang, I.-S., A Study on Temperature Changes Scenario of Han Peninsular Due to Global Warming (1993) Symposium on Climatic Change Impacts to Han Peninsular - IV.
