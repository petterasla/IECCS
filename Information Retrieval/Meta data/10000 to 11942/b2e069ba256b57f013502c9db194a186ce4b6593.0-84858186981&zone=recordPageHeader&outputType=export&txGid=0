Because the area of SWWA occupies only a few grid points of a typical global climate model (GCM), it is difficult to infer the possible role of global climate change in the drought in SWWA. Since the Indian Ocean High is a robust and large scale feature of atmospheric general circulation, it is simulated qualitatively in all GCMs. A quantitative comparison of the simulated past changes in its pressure and position in a GCM with those found in reanalysis data can be used to verify its suitability in projecting future changes in winter rainfall in southwest Western Australia. This paper examines the linkages between changes in the Indian Ocean High and rainfall in SWWA, as well as a larger section of Western Australia. By introducing objective indices for area-weighted pressure, the area-weighted latitude and longitude positions of the High, this analysis shows that winter rainfall in a large section of Western Australia and in SWWA is significantly correlated with longitudinal displacement of the Indian Ocean High. Rainfall in SWWA is also correlated with the area-averaged pressure of the High. A regression model of May to August rainfall in SWWA using the pressure and longitude of the Indian Ocean High as independent variables explains 52 per cent of the rainfall variance during 1951-2008.",,"atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate modeling; drought; global climate; high pressure system; precipitation (climatology); precipitation assessment; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; sea level pressure; winter; Australia; Indian Ocean",,,,,,"Allan, R.J., Haylock, M.R., Circulation features associated with the winter rainfall decrease in southwestern Australia (1993) Journal of Climate, 6 (7), pp. 1356-1367; Bakalian, F.M., Hameed, S., Pickart, R., Influence of the Icelandic Low Latitude on the frequency of Greenland Tip Jet Events: Implications for Irminger Sea convection (2007) J.
