Expansion of agriculture into remaining areas of natural vegetation is undesirable, as this would reduce biodiversity on the planet. Maintaining or indeed improving crop yields on existing farmed land, whether on a smallholder scale or on larger farms, is thus necessary. One of the limiting factors is often weed control; biological control of weeds is generally of limited use and mechanical control is either often difficult with machinery or very laborious by hand. Thus the use of herbicides has become very important. Minimum cultivation can also be important, as it reduces the power required to work the soil, limits erosion and helps to maintain the organic matter content of the soil. This last aspect helps preserve both the structure of soil and its populations of organisms, and also sustains the Earth's soil as a massive sink for carbon, an important consideration in the light of global warming. The introduction of the bipyridinium herbicide paraquat in the early 1960s greatly facilitated weed control in many crops. Paraquat has the unusual property of being active only by direct spray onto plants and not by uptake from soil in which strong binding deactivates it. Together with its rapid action in light in killing green plant tissue, such properties allow paraquat to be used in many crops, including those grown by low-tillage methods. This paper reviews the ways in which agricultural systems have been and are being developed to make use of these properties, and provides a risk/benefit analysis of the world-wide use of paraquat over nearly 40 years. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Bioavailability; Bipyridinium herbicides; Deactivation; Degradation; Minimum cultivation; Paraquat; Risk/benefit analysis; Soil sorption; Sustainable agriculture","bipyridine; herbicide; paraquat; agricultural production; bioavailability; chemical control; herbicide; sorption; sustainable development; bioavailability; chemical structure; ecotoxicology; greenhouse effect; harvest; orchard; organic matter production; review; rhizome; risk benefit analysis; soil erosion; sustainable agriculture; tillage; vegetation; weed control; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Herbicides; Paraquat; Risk Assessment; Soil; Viridiplantae",,"bipyridine, 37275-48-2; paraquat, 1910-42-5, 3240-78-6, 4685-14-7; Herbicides; Paraquat, 4685-14-7; Soil",,,,"Roberts, T.R., Dyson, J.S., Lane, M.C.G., Deactivation of the biological activity of paraquat in the soil environment - A review (2002) J Agric Food Chem, 50, pp. 3623-3631; Dyson, J.S., Ecological safety of paraquat with particular reference to soil (1997) The Planter, Kuala Lumpur, 73, pp. 467-478; Summers, L.A., (1980) The Bipyridinium Herbicides, , Academic Press, London; Weber, J.B., Perry, P.W., Upchurch, R.P., The influence of temperature and time on the adsorption of paraquat, diquat, 2,4-D and prometone by clays, charcoal and an anion-exchange resin (1965) Soil Sci Soc Am Proc, 29, pp. 678-688; Weber, J.B., Weed, S.N., Adsorption and desorption of diquat, paraquat, and prometone by montmorillonitic and kaolinitic clay minerals (1968) Soil Sci Soc Am Proc, 32, pp. 485-487; Knight, B.A.G., Denny, P.J., The interaction of paraquat with soil: Adsorption by an expanding lattice clay mineral (1970) Weed Res, 10, pp. 40-48; Arienzo, M., Buondonno, A., Adsorption of paraquat by terra rossa soil and model soil aggregates (1993) Toxicol Environ Chem, 39, pp. 193-199; Knight, B.A.G., Tomlinson, T.E., The interaction of paraquat (1:1′-dimethyl-4:4′-dipyridylium dichloride) with mineral soils (1967) J Soil Sci, 18, pp. 233-243; Tomlinson, T.E., Knight, B.A.G., Bastow, A.W., Heaver, A.A., (1968) Structural Factors Affecting the Adsorption of Bipyridylium Cations by Clay Minerals, pp. 317-333. , Society of Chemical Industry Monograph No 29, Society of Chemical Industry, London; Riley, D., Tucker, B.V., Wilkinson, W., Biological unavailability of bound paraquat residues in soil (1976) Bound and Conjugated Pesticide Residues, pp. 301-353. , ed by Kaufman DD, Still GG, Paulson GD and Vandal SK, ACS Symposium Series 29, American Chemical Society, Washington, DC; Fryer, J.D., Hance, R.J., Ludwig, J.W., Long term persistence of paraquat in sandy loam soil (1975) Weed Res, 15, pp. 189-194; Hance, R.J., Byast, T.H., Smith, P.D., Apparent decomposition of paraquat in soil (1980) Soil Biol Biochem, 12, pp. 447-448; Cheah, U.B., Kirkwood, R.C., Lum, K.Y., Degradation of four commonly used pesticides in Malaysian agricultural soils (1998) J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 1217-1223; Slade, P., Photochemical degradation of paraquat (1965) Nature (London), 207, pp. 515-516; Slade, P., The fate of paraquat applied to plants (1966) Weed Res, 6, pp. 158-167; Constenla, M.A., Riley, D., Kennedy, S.H., Rojas, C.F., Mora, L.E., Stevens, J.E.B., Paraquat behavior in Costa Rican soils and residues in coffee (1990) J Agric Food Chem, 38, pp. 1985-1988; Burns, R.G., Audus, L.J., Distribution and breakdown of paraquat in soil (1970) Weed Res, 18, pp. 49-58; Ricketts, D., Paraquat is intrinsically biodegradable (1998) 9th International Congress of Pesticide Chemistry, The Food-Environment Challenge, 2, pp. 6A-018. , Abstracts; Lee, S.J., Katayama, A., Kimura, M., Microbial degradation of paraquat sorbed to plant residues (1995) J Agric Food Chem, 43, pp. 1343-1347; Calderbank, A., Slade, P., (1976) Herbicides.
