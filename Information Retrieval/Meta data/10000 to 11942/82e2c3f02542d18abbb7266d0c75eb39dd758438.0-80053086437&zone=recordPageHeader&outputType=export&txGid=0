Trends of accumulated temperature and negative temperature, growing season duration, as well as seasonal and annual rainfalls at 48 stations were analyzed. The results show that the accumulated temperature increased significantly by 348.5±C day due to global warming during 1961-2009 while the absolute accumulated negative temperature decreased apparently by 175.3±C day. The start of growing season displayed a significant negative trend of -14.3 days during 19612009, but the end of growing season delayed insignificantly by 6.7 days. As a result, the length of growing season increased by 21.0 days. The annual and autumn rainfalls decreased slightly while summer rainfall and summer rainy days decreased significantly. In contrast, spring rainfall increased slightly without significant trends. All the results indicate that the thermal conditions were improved to benefit the crop growth over the North China Plain during 1961-2009, and the decreasing annual and summer rainfalls had no direct negative impact on the crop growth. But the decreasing summer rainfall was likely to influence the water resources in North China, especially the underground water, reservoir water, as well as river runoff, which would have influenced the irrigation of agriculture. © The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Agriculture; Climate change; North China plain","agriculture; air temperature; climate change; global warming; meteorology; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; runoff; trend analysis; China; North China Plain",,,,,,"Bauer, A., Fanning, C., Enz, J.W., Eber-Lein, C.V., 1984: Use of growing degree-days to determine spring wheat growth stages North Dakota State Univ, pp. EB-37. , Agricultural Extension Bulletin; Berner, J., Callaghan, T.V., Huntington, H., (2004) Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, p. 1020. , Cambridge University Press; Atlas of China (2000), p. 251. , Sinomaps Press, CMA (China Meteorological Administration), (in Chinese)China Agriculture Yearbook 2009 (2009) China Agriculture Publishing House, p. 619. , CMA (China Ministry of Agriculture), (in Chinese); Foley, J., Defries, R., Asner, G., Global consequences of land use (2005) Science, 309, pp. 570-574; Frich, P., Alexander, L., Della-Marta, P., Observed coherent changes in climatic extremes during the second half of the twentieth century (2002) Climate Res, 19, pp. 193-212; Gao, X., Zongci, Z., Yihui, D., Climate change due to greenhouse effects in China as simulated by a regional climate model (2001) Adv.
