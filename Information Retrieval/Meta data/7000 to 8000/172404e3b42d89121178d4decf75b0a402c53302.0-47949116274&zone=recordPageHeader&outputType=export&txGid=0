An April-September mean temperature reconstruction (1826 - 2004) has been developed for the north-central Shaanxi Province, China, based on tree-ring width analysis. The reconstruction captures 39.3% (p < 0.001) of the variance in the instrumental data over the calibration period from 1951 to 2002. The reconstruction shows a high temperature period of 1928 - 1933, which coincides with the timing of the extreme drought event in 1920s in the entire northern China. The two low temperature periods in reconstruction are 1883 - 1888 and 1938 - 1942. With the global warming, the April-September mean temperature in study area has also increased since the 1970s, but has not exceeded the temperature in 1928 - 1933. Besides the statistical analysis, the reconstruction is also verified by the local dryness/wetness index and other dendroclimatological results. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.","April-Septembermean temperature; Huanglong Mountain; Pinus tabulaeformis; Shaanxi; Tree-ringwidth","Chinese Loess Plateau; High resolutions; Mean temperatures; Time Series; Tree rings; Tree-ring width; calibration; dendroclimatology; drought; low temperature; paleoclimate; reconstruction; statistical analysis; tree ring; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Huanglong Nature Reserve; Shaanxi; Sichuan; Pinus tabuliformis",,,,,,"Fritts, H.C., (1976) Tree Rings and Climate, , London: Academic Press; Mann, M.E., Bradley, R.S., Hughes, M.K., Northern Hemisphere temperature during the past millennium: Inferences, uncertainties and limitations (1999) Geophys Res Lett, 26 (6), pp. 759-762; Briffa, K.R., Osborn, T.J., Schweingruber, F.H., Low-frequency temperature variation from a northern tree ring density network (2001) J Geophys Res, 106 (D3), pp. 2929-2941; Cook, E.R., Esper, J., D'Arrigo, R.D., Extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere land temperature variability over the past 1000 years (2004) Quat Sci Rev, 23, pp. 2063-2074; Yadav, R.R., Singh, J., Tree-ring-based spring temperature patterns over the past four centuries in western Himalaya (2002) Quat Res, 57, pp. 299-305; Yadav, R.R., Park, W.K., Singh, J., Do the western Himalayas defy global warming?
