Seedlings of Quercus ilex subsp. ballota (evergreen and diffuse-porous wood) and Q. faginea (semi-deciduous and ring-porous wood) were grown under two temperatures (12 and 19 °C) and two photoperiods (10 and 16 h) in a factorial experiment. In the 16 h photoperiod at 19 °C, photosynthesis was suppressed in half of the seedlings by covering leaves with aluminium foil. The concentration of soluble sugars, starch and lipids in leaves, stems and roots was assessed before and after budburst. Under the 12 °C treatment (mean current temperature in early spring in the Iberian Peninsula), budburst in Q. faginea occurred earlier than in Q. ilex. Higher temperature promoted earlier budburst in both species, mostly under the 16 h photoperiod. This response was less pronounced in Q. faginea because its budburst was also controlled by photoperiod, and because this species needs to construct a new ring of xylem before budburst to supply its growth demands. Therefore, dates of budburst of the two species became closer to each other in the warmer treatment, which might alter competitive relations between the species with changing climate. While Q. ilex relied on carbon reserves for budburst, Q. faginea relied on both carbon reserves and current photoassimilates. The different responses of the two Quercus species to temperature and photoperiod related more to xylem structure than to the source of carbon used for budburst. © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Global warming; Lipids; Phenology; Quercus faginea; Quercus ilex; Soluble sugars; Starch; Wood anatomy","carbon; starch; budburst; evergreen tree; global warming; leaf morphology; lipid; Mediterranean environment; phenology; photoperiod; photosynthesis; solubility; starch; sugar; temperature effect; wood; article; biomass; carbohydrate metabolism; cytology; flower; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; heat; lipid metabolism; metabolism; oak; photoperiodicity; photosynthesis; physiology; plant; wood; xylem; Biomass; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon; Flowers; Greenhouse Effect; Hot Temperature; Lipid Metabolism; Photoperiod; Photosynthesis; Plant Components; Quercus; Starch; Wood; Xylem; Ballota; Ilex; Quercus; Quercus faginea; Quercus ilex",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Starch, 9005-25-8",,,,"Augpurger, C.K., Bartlett, E.A., Differences in leaf phenology between juvenile and adult trees in a temperate deciduous forest (2003) Tree Physiology, 23, pp. 517-525; Badeck, F.-W., Bondeau, A., Böttcher, K., Doktor, D., Lucht, W., Schaber, J., Sitch, S., Responses of spring phenology to climate change (2004) New Phytologist, 162, pp. 295-309; Barbaroux, C., Bréda, N., Contrasting distribution and seasonal dynamics of carbohydrate reserves in stem wood of adult ring-porous sessile oak and diffuse-porous beech trees (2002) Tree Physiology, 22, pp. 1201-1210; Bertero, H.D., King, R.W., Hall, A.J., Photoperiod and temperature effects on the rate of leaf appearance in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) (2000) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 27, pp. 349-356; Blanco Castro, E., Casado González, M.A., Costa Tenorio, M., (1997) Los Bosques Ibéricos.
