(Survey of School Buildings, UK Department of Education and Science, HMSO, London, 1987).1 The total rate of expenditure on fuel for heating and lighting these buildings is about £75 million per annum. The dissipation of energy, derived from fossil fuels, in buildings accounts for approximately 24% of the CO2 emissions, and so is a considerable contributor to the excess greenhouse effect and hence global warming. Practising energy thrift in schools therefore represents a considerable opportunity for achieving significant savings with respect to running costs and achieving a more sustainable society. Thus it is not surprising that the number of school buildings incorporating one set of measures, the so-called 'passive-solar' features, is increasing. Such buildings possess the ability to be thermally comfortable while providing mentally-stimulating environments, yet require significantly reduced rates of fossil-fuel consumption compared with those for 'conventional' buildings of similar sizes. The behaviours of six such passive-solar schools have been studied and the effectiveness of each of them has been assessed. Recommendations concerning the inclusion of passive-solar features in educational buildings are made. © 1991.",,"Energy Conservation; Solar Energy; Energy Dissipation; Global Warming; Passive-Solar Schools; School Buildings",,,,,,"UK Department of Education and Science, (1987) Survey of School Buildings, , HMSO, London; UK Department of Education and Science, Guidelines for Environmental Design and Fuel Conservation in Educational Buildings (1977) Design Note 17, , HMSO, London; Norton, Hobday, Passive Solar Schools (1989) Report to the UK Department of Education and Science, , London","Harris, D.J.; Department of Applied Energy, Cranfield Institute of Technology, Bedford, MK43 0AL, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.
