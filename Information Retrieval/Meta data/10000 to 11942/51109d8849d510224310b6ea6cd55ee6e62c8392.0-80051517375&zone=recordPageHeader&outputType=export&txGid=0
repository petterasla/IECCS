The study was carried out, based on a real project that is presently installed on similar lines. The fuel needs of a community of 100,000 people were quantified in terms of sugar, ethanol, and electricity. A mass and energy balance was calculated to determine the amounts of cane and trash needed to produce the sugar, ethanol and electricity by generation and cogeneration. The results showed that 100 t of cane per hour can supply sufficient sugar and electrical energy for a community of 100,000 people and run their cars on 96% (by volume) ethanol (no mix with gasoline) and still be able to export surplus ethanol. The self-sufficiency is for the whole year and not only the crop period. The overall results show that, when compared with the importation of 'fuels', the project is positive.","Cogeneration; Ethanol; Sugar",,,,,,,,"Jais, P.C.; International Sugar Consultant, Sugarsoft Ltda., Voluntários de Piracicaba, 812, Centra, Piracicaba - SP, Brazil; email: peter@sugarsoft.com.br",,,,,,,,03448657,,,,"English","Zuckerindustrie",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051517375
