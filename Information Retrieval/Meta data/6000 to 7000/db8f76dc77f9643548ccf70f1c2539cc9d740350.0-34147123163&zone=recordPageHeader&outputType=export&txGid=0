The record length of WVP observation series of each station varied between 31- and 41-years between 1962 and 2002. The monthly mean WVP observation series of each station was rearranged on seasonal basis. Sequential Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen's slope estimator, and Spearman's rank-order correlation tests were employed for detection of likely trends, and Kruskall-Wallis test was used to detect decadal variations in WVP series of each observation station. A possible area of representation for each meteorological station was determined by using the Thiessen polygons technique in a geographical information systems media. It was found that 15 seasonal WVP series have a positive trend covering 97% of the GAP area in the summer season; although one WVP series has a negative trend direction. However, in the spring season, 33% of the area had a positive trend, and a negative trend did not appear in any stations. WVP records in the winter season showed an increasing trend over 19% of the GAP area, whereas a decreasing trend prevailed in 9% of the area. The study results led us to conclude that the substantial increase of WVP observations in summer season could be attributed to both the shift from rain-fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture being made increasingly spacious year by year and building large water reservoirs in the GAP located in a semi-arid region. The results also indirectly suggested that the historical trends in the WVP parameters might be related to global climate change phenomenon. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Correlation methods; Parameter estimation; Rain; Soils; Water vapor; Kruskall-Wallis test; Meteorological stations; Water vapor pressure (WVP); Water resources; climate change; decadal variation; seasonal variation; semiarid region; vapor pressure; water resource; water vapor; Anatolia; Eurasia; Turkey",,,,,,"Brunetti, M., Buffoni, L., Maugeri, M., Nanni, T., Trends of minimum and maximum daily temperatures in Italy from 1865 to 1996 (2000) Theor Appl Climatol, 66, pp. 49-60; Dahmen, E.R., Hall, M.J., (1990) Screening of hydrological data: Tests for stationarity and relative consistency, p. 58. , ILRI, The Netherlands, p, Publication #49; (2004), http://www.die.gov.tr, DİEDraper, N.R., Smith, H., Applied regression analysis (1981) Wiley, New York, p. 708; (2004), http://www.dsi.gov.tr, DSİGaffen, D.J., Ross, R.J., Climatology and trends of U.S. surface humidity and temperature (1999) J Climate, 12, pp. 811-828; Hidalgo, J.C.G., Luís, M.D., Ravendós, J., Sánchez, J.R., Daily rainfall trend in the Valencia region of Spain (2002) Theor Appl Climatol, 75, pp. 117-130; Hoinka, K.P., Mean global surface pressure series evaluated from ECMWF reanalysis data (1998) Q J R Meteorol Soc, 124 (551), pp. 2291-2297; Hsu, H.-H., Chen, C.-T., Observed and projected climate change in Taiwan (2002) Meteorol Atmos Phys, 79, pp. 87-104; Kaiser, D.P., Decreasing cloudiness over China: An updated analysis examining additional variables (2000) Geophys Res Lett, 27, pp. 2193-2196; Karaca, M., Tayanç, M., Toros, H., Effects of urbanization on climate of İstanbul and Ankara (1995) Atmos Environ, 29 (23), pp. 3411-3421; Kothyari, U.C., Singh, V.P., Aravamuthan, V., An investigation of changes in rainfall and temperature regimes of the Ganga Basin in India (1997) Water Resour Manag, 11, pp. 17-34; Marengo, J.A., Interdecadal variability and trends of rainfall across the Amazon Basin (2004) Theor Appl Climatol, 78, pp. 79-96; Sen, P.K., Estimates of the regression coefficient based on Kendall's tau (1968) J Am Stat Assoc, 63 (324), pp. 1379-1389; Serrano, A., Mateos, V.L., García, J.A., Trend analysis of monthly precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1921-1995 (1999) Phys Chem Earth (B), 20 (1-2), pp. 85-90; Siegel, S., Castellan Jr, N.J., (1988) Nonparametric statistics for the behavioral sciences, p. 399. , McGraw-Hill, p; Sneyers, R., (1990) On the statistical analysis of series of observations, WMO Technical Note No: 143, WMO, p. 192. , Publication #415, WMO, Geneva, p; Tonkaz, T., Çetin, M., Şimşek, M., Observed changes of some climatic parameters of Şanliurfa Province (in Turkish with English abstract) (2003) J Agric Fac ÇÜ, 18, pp. 29-38; Türkeş, M., Spatial and temporal analysis of annual rainfall variations in Turkey (1996) Int J Climatol, 16, pp. 1057-1076; Türkeş, M., Sümer, U.M., Demir, I., Re-evaluation of trends and changes in mean, maximum and minimum temperatures of Turkey for the period 1929-1999 (2002) Int J Climatol, 22, pp. 947-977; Türkeş, M., Sümer, U.M., Kilinç, G., Variations and trends in annual mean air temperatures in Turkey with respect to climatic variability (1995) Int J Climatol, 15, pp. 557-569; Wang, J.X.L., Gaffen, D.J., Trends in extremes of surface humidity, temperatures and summertime heat stress in China (2001) Adv Atmos Sci, 18 (5), pp. 742-751; Xu, Z.X., Takeuchi, K., Ishidaira, H., Long-term trends of annual temperature and precipitation time series in Japan (2002) J Hydrosci Hydraul Eng, 20 (2), pp. 11-26; Yu, Y.S., Zou, S., Whittemore, D., Non-parametric trend analysis of water quality data of rivers in Kansas (1993) J Hydrol, 150, pp. 61-80; Yue, S., Hashino, M., Temperature trends in Japan: 1900-1996 (2003) Theor Appl Climatol, 75, pp. 15-27","Tonkaz, T.; Department of Agricultural Structures and Irrigation, Faculty of Agriculture, Harran University, Şanliurfa 63040, Turkey; email: ttonkaz@harran.edu.tr",,,,,,,,01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.
