It was developed to replace R-134a, which is being phased out in the European Union because of its high global warming potential (IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report-Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report, 2007). HFO-1234yf is highly energy efficient, exhibits low toxicity, and can be potentially used in direct expansion automotive A/C systems with minimal design modifications. Significant work has been previously completed to confirm the mild flammability characteristics of HFO-1234yf. To understand the impact of accidental releases of HFO-1234yf into a garage environment, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling was used to simulate releases of HFO-1234yf under various A/C line rupture scenarios. In particular, releases were simulated using a leak source in a calm open area, a room with no forced ventilation and the same space but impinging on a flat plate. The refrigerant concentration was determined as function of distance (x, y, and z directions) from the leak point during leak event. The size and shape of the portion of the refrigerant plume above the lower flammability limit was also determined. This work enforces the benefit of using the inherently safer practice of minimization of refrigerant quantities. This article will review CFD modeling results for given refrigerant leak scenarios. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Automobile Refrigerant; Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD; Dispersion; Flammable Hazards; Global Warming","A/C systems; Accidental release; Automotive air conditioning; CFD modeling; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Design modifications; Direct expansion; Dispersion modeling; Energy efficient; European Union; Flammability characteristics; Flammable Hazards; Flat plate; Forced ventilation; Global warming potential; Inherently safer; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Leak points; Line ruptures; Low toxicity; Lower flammability limits; Nielsen; Size and shape; Z-directions; Buildings; Dispersions; Flammability; Fluid dynamics; Fluids; Garages (parking); Global warming; Olefins; Refrigerants; Computational fluid dynamics",,,,,,"(2007), European Fluorocarbon Technical Committee, F-Gas regulation, Available at:, October 4, 2010(2006), European Union, Directive 2006/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending, Council Directive 70/156/EEC Brussels, May 17, Official Journal of the European Union L 161/12-18Minor, B., Herrmann, D., Gravell, R., Flammability characteristics of HFO-1234yf (2009) Process Safety Prog, 29, pp. 150-154; (2008), American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), Addenda to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34-2007, Designation and Safety Classification of Refrigerants, 1st Public Review of BSR/ASHRAE Addendum w to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34-2007(2010), Safety Data Sheet for DuPont TM HFO-1234yf Refrigerant.
