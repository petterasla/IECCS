Species richness and abundance have been hypothesized to increase with ecosystem productivity. Moreover, productivity of ecosystems varies in space and time, and this heterogeneity is also hypothesized to influence species richness and abundance of individuals. Ecosystem productivity may be estimated using remotely sensed data, and researchers have specifically proposed the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (AVHRR-NDVI). Interannual average NDVI and its variability (standard deviation) were correlated with large mammal species richness and abundance of individuals at a landscape scale in Kenya. The biodiversity indicators associated negatively with interannual average NDVI and positively with variability of NDVI. Understanding these relationships can help in estimating changes in mammalian species richness and abundance in response to global climate change.",,"Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecosystems; Radiometers; Vegetation; Mammals; Remote sensing; abundance; AVHRR; biodiversity; climate change; mammal; NDVI; species richness; Kenya",,,,,,"Abramsky, Z., Rosenzweig, M.L., Tilman's predicted productivity-diversity relationship shown by desert rodents (1984) Nature, 309, pp. 150-151; (2000) Africa Data Dissemination Service, , http://edcsnw4.cr.usgs.gov/adds/adds.html, EROS Data Center, U.S. Geological Survey Sioux Falls, South Dakota, US 57198; Begon, M., Harper, J.L., Townsend, C.R., (1990) Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities, , Blackwell Scientific Publications, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 945 p; Bohning-Gaese, K., Determinants of avian species richness at different spatial scales (1997) Journal of Biogeography, 24, pp. 49-60; Box, E.O., Holben, B.N., Kalb, V., Accuracy of the AVHRR Vegetation Index as a predictor of biomass, primary productivity and net CO2 flux (1989) Vegetation, 80, pp. 71-89; Brown, J.H., Species diversity (1988) Analytical Biogeography, An Integrated Approach to the Study of Animal and Plant Distributions, pp. 57-89. , (A.A.
