Reactors were fed at flow rates of 125, 167, 250, 333 and 500 ml/day, yielding Hydraulic Retention Times (HRTs) of 40, 30, 20, 15 and 10 days. Increasing the OLR decreases the organic digestion. The highest methane yield (340 l at STP/kg COD degraded) was obtained at the OLR of 1.25 kg COD/m3day. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","agricultural waste; anaerobic digestion; biogas; global warming; greenhouse gas; Jatropha curcas; methane",,,,,,,"APHA and AWWA (American Public Health Association and American Water Works Association), (2005) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, , 21st ed., Washington DC, USA; AOAC, (1990) Official Methods of Analysis, , AOAC International, 15th ed.
