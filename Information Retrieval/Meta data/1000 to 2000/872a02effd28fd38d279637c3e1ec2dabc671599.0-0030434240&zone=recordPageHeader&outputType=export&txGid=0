K9J 7B8, Canada","A new technique has been developed to make possible the laboratory study of the infrared-emission spectra of gases of atmospheric interest. The thermal-emission spectra are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, just as they are in the atmosphere, and are not chemiluminescent. Demonstration results obtained by the use of this new technique are presented for dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12) at a pressure of 0.5 Torr in a cell with a path length of 5 cm. The measured cell spectra have been compared with simulations with the FASCD3P radiation code. The measurements of the emission spectra of radiatively active gases may be important for the atmospheric greenhouse effect and global warming. © 1996 Optical Society of America.","CFC-12; Greenhouse effect; Local thermodynamic equilibrium; Thermal-emission spectroscopy","atmospheric instrument; CFC-12; emission spectra; greenhouse effect; infrared; spectroscopy; thermal emission; thermodynamic equilibrium",,,,,,"Shire, K.P., Derwent, R.G., Wuebbler, D.J., Morcrette, J.-J., Radiative forcing of climate (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , J.
