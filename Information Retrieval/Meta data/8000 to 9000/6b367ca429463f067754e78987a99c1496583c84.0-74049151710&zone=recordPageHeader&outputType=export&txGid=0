This large-scale survey allows testing the hypothesis that beside commonly used ecological variables, diversity of pedogenesis is another major component for assessing carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. The aim of the presented research was to evaluate consequences of permafrost degradation for C and N stocks and hence nutrient supply for plants, as the transect covers all types of permafrost including heavily degraded areas and regions without permafrost. Our results show that SM is the dominant parameter explaining 64% of Corg and 60% of N variation. The extent of the effect of SM is determined by permafrost, current aeolian sedimentation occurring mostly on degraded sites, and pedogenesis. Thus, the explanatory power for C and N concentrations is significantly improved by adding CaCO3 content (P50.012 for Corg; P50.006 for Nt) and soil texture (P50.077 for Corg; P50.015 for Nt) to the model. For soil temperature, no correlations were detected indicating that in high-altitude grassland ecosystems influenced by permafrost, SM overrides soil temperature as the main driving parameter at landscape scale. It was concluded from the current study that degradation of permafrost and corresponding changes in soil hydrology combined with a shift from mature stages of pedogenesis to initial stages, have severe impact on soil C and plant available N. This may alter biodiversity patterns as well as the development and functioning of the ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Alpine grassland; Global warming; Pedogenesis; Permafrost degradation; Plant available nitrogen; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Soil moisture; Soil nitrogen; Soil organic carbon; Soil texture","biodiversity; global warming; hypothesis testing; numerical model; organic carbon; pedogenesis; permafrost; soil carbon; soil degradation; soil ecosystem; soil moisture; soil nitrogen; soil survey; soil temperature; soil texture; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,,,,,"Böhner, J., Lehmkuhl, F., Climate and environmental change modelling in central and high asia (2005) Boreas, 34, pp. 220-231; Burke, I.C., Lauenroth, W.K., Parton, W.J., Regional and temporal variation in net primary production and nitrogen mineralization in grasslands (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1330-1340; Callesen, I., Liski, J., Raulund-Rasmussen, K., Olsson, M.T., Tau-Strand, L., Vsterdas, L., Westman, C.J., Soil carbon stores in Nordic well-drained forest soils - relationships with climate and texture class (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 358-370; Chang, D.H.S., The vegetation zonation of the Tibetian Plateau (1981) Mountain Research and Development, 1, pp. 29-48; Chapin F.S.
