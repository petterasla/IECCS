A catastrophic failure of the plant is assumed and the impacts on the atmospheric environment are estimated. The method is designed for assessing possible alternative process routes [the raw material(s) and the sequence of reaction steps that converts them to the desired product(s)] to make a chemical, in order to determine the route that has the least adverse atmospheric environmental impact. Thus the routes that are inherently environmentally hazardous can be identified and avoided when the selection is made in the early stages of production plant design. The atmospheric impact categories considered are toxicity, photochemical smog, acid deposition, global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. The magnitude of these impacts are expressed on a scale of 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum). Each of these impact categories is assigned an importance factor value (I) depending upon: the spatial scale affected by, the degree of 'directness' of and the reversibility of the impact. These factors are used to calculate a weighted category hazard (WCH) value for each chemical. The WCH of all the impact categories and chemicals are combined to estimate the AHI. The AHI has been tested on six potential and established routes to methyl methacrylate (MMA). The route based on propylene has the lowest AHI value. In all the routes the storage inventory has the potential to cause the most environmental damage compared with the reaction and separation inventories.","Atmospheric hazard; Impact assessment; Inherent environmental friendliness; Methyl methacrylate","Accident prevention; Calculations; Chemical plants; Design; Environmental impact; Estimation; Failure analysis; Hazards; Process engineering; Atmospheric chemistry; Deposition; Environmental impact assessments; Global warming; Photochemical reactions; Toxicity; Upper atmosphere; Alternative chemical process routes; Atmospheric hazard index; Catastrophic chemical releases; Chemical production plant; Index method; Reaction steps; Weighted category hazard; Airborne releases; Atmospheric hazard index (AHI); Catastrophic Chemical Releases; Inherent environmental friendliness; Methyl methacrylate; Weighted category hazard (WCH); Chemical engineering; Chemical wastes",,,,,,"Calamari, D., Vighi, M., (1993) Scientific Basis for the Assessment of Several Chemical Substances in Combination at Low Level, , (EEC, Luxemburg); Calvert, J.G., Atkinson, R.A., Becker, K.H., Kamens, R.M., Seinfeld, J.H., Wallington, T.H., Yarwood, G., (2002) The Mechanisms of Atmospheric Oxidation of the Aromatic Hydrocarbons, , (Oxford University Press, New York, USA); Cave, S., Edwards, D.W., Chemical process route selection based on assessment of inherent environmental hazard (1997) Comput Chem Eng, 21, pp. S965-S970; Christen, P., Bohnenblust, H., Seitz, S., A method for assessing catastrophic damage to the population and environment: A quantitative multi-attribute approach for risk analysis based on fuzzy set theory (1994) Proc Safety Prog, 13 (4), pp. 234-238; Crowl, D.A., Louvar, J.F., (2001) Chemical Process Safety: Fundamentals with Applications, , (Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA); Edwards, D.W., Lawrence, D., Assessing the inherent safety of chemical process routes: Is there a relation between plant costs and inherent safety?
