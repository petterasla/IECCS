The power transmission network planning problem is modeled by the mixed integer programming model, a GA, and SA. At this moment environmental issues have the most serious problem to be concerned within every part of the world. Global warming, which is mainly caused by the emissions of Green House Gases (GHGs), is said to be a serious part of these environmental problems. Since green house gases issues become important and the new legislations are taken into account, carbon emissions costs are included in the total costs of the transmission network planning. This method of solution is demonstrated on the real problem. Finally, the genetic algorithm shows to be a very good option for network planning systems given that it obtains much accentuated reductions of iteration, which is very important for network planning. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
