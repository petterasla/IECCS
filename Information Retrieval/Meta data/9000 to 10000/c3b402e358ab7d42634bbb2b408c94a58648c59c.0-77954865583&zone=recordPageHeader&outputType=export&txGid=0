In this laboratory study, we examined the influence of sea water temperature on the duration of pre-competency of larvae of four broadcast spawning coral species. Fungia repanda, Acropora millepora, A. spathulata and Symphyllia recta larvae demonstrated large differences in cohort competency levels when cultured over a 4°C range during the first 4 days post fertilisation. Warmer temperatures reduced pre-competency periods by at least a day for all species, but there were also indications of an upper temperature threshold of less than 32°C for the development of F. repanda, A. millepora and S. recta. These data suggest a general flexibility in ontogenic response to ambient water temperatures. Sea surface temperatures (SST) that differ at spawning time by as little as 2°C, due to inter-annual or latitudinal variation, are likely to alter coral larval dispersal ranges. In some locations, notably the central Indo-Pacific, where major coral spawning activity can coincide with seasonal SST maxima, a future 2°C increase due to climate change may have serious negative effects on coral development and distribution. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Climate; Coral; Development; Global warming; Larva; Metamorphosis; Settlement","cohort analysis; coral reef; developmental biology; dispersal; ecosystem response; global warming; laboratory method; larva; metamorphosis; ontogeny; phenotypic plasticity; population distribution; sea surface temperature; seawater; spawning; species diversity; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Acropora millepora; Anthozoa; Fungia repanda; Symphyllia recta",,,,,,"Ayre, D.J., Hughes, T.P., Genotypic diversity and gene flow in brooding and spawning corals along the great barrier reef, Australia (2000) Evolution, 54, pp. 1590-1605; Babcock, R.C., Heyward, A.J., Larval development of certain gamete-spawning scleractinian corals (1986) Coral Reefs, 5, pp. 111-116; Babcock, R.C., Baird, A.H., Piromvaragorn, S., Thomson, D.P., Willis, B.L., Identification of scleractinian coral recruits from Indo-Pacific reefs (2003) Zool Stud, 42, pp. 211-226; Bassim, K.M., Sammarco, P.W., Effects of temperature and ammonium on larval development and survivorship in a scleractinian coral Diploria strigosa (2003) Mar Biol, 142, p. 241; Bassim, K.M., Sammarco, P.W., Snell, T.L., Effects of temperature on success of (self and non-self) fertilization and embryogenesis in Diploria strigosa (Cnidaria, Scleractinia) (2002) Mar Biol, 140, pp. 479-488; Berkelmans, R., Willis, B.L., Seasonal and local spatial patterns in the upper thermal limits of corals on the inshore central great barrier reef (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 219-228; Edmunds, P., Gates, R., Gleason, D., The biology of larvae from the reef coral Porites astreoides, and their response to temperature disturbances (2001) Mar Biol, 139, pp. 981-989; Gillooly, J.F., Charnov, E.L., West, G.B., Savage, V.M., Brown, J.H., Effects of size and temperature on developmental time (2002) Nature, 417, pp. 70-73; Graham, E., Baird, A., Connolly, S., Survival dynamics of scleractinian coral larvae and implications for dispersal (2008) Coral Reefs, 27, pp. 529-539; Harrison, P.L., Wallace, C.C., Reproduction, dispersal and recruitment of scleractinian corals (1990) Coral Reefs (Ecosystems of the World; 25), pp. 133-207. , Z.
