Baseline tests have been carried out with R134a and HC mixture and the performance parameters were compared with the five selected alternative refrigerant mixtures. The performance is optimised by varying the refrigerant charge and capillary tube length under experimental conditions for both the pull-down test and the energy consumption test. The optimised refrigerant charge of the ternary mixture is approximately 50% of that of the optimised R134a system and the global warming effects will be decreased by two-thirds. The cooling speed is increased by 25% and COP is increased by 9.9%. The length of the capillary is increased by 63.63% to obtain the best performance. The agreement between the predicted values and experimental values is found to be satisfactory. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","global warming; isobutane; performance characteristics; propane; R134a; ternary mixture; visi cooler",,,,,,,"Agarwal, R.S., Comparative study of hydrocarbon mixtures and MP-39 as refrigerants to retrofit CFC-12 based domestic refrigerator-freezers (1996) Proceedings of the International Refrigeration Conference at Purdue, pp. 471-476. , 23–26 July, Purdue University, Wet Lafayette, Indiana, USA; Chen, Q., Prasad, R.C., Simulation of a vapour-compression refrigeration cycles using HFC134A and CFC12 (1999) International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, 26 (4), pp. 513-521. , May; Douglas, J.D., Groll, E.A., Braun, J.E., Tree, D.R., Evaluation of propane as an alternative to HCFC-22 in residential applications (1996) Proceedings of the International Refrigeration Conference at Purdue, pp. 13-20. , 23–26 July, Purdue University, Wet Lafayette, Indiana, USA; Halimic, E., Ross, D., Agnew, B., Anderson, A., Potts, I., A comparison of the operating performance of alternative refrigerants (2003) Applied Thermal Engineering, 23, pp. 1441-1451; Havelsky, V., Investigation of refrigerating system with R12 refrigerant replacements (2000) Applied Thermal Engineering, 20 (2), pp. 133-140. , February; Jung, D.S., Radermacher, R., Performance simulation of single-evaporator domestic refrigerators charged with pure and mixed refrigerants (1991) International Journal of Refrigeration, 14 (July), pp. 223-232; Jwo, C.-S., Ting, C.-C., Wang, W.-R., Efficiency analysis of home refrigerators by replacing hydrocarbon refrigerants (2009) Measurement, 42 (5), pp. 697-701. , June; Khan, S.H., Zubair, S.M., Thermodynamic analyses of the CFC-12 and HFC-134a refrigeration cycles (1993) Energy, 18 (7), pp. 717-726. , July; Kuijpers, L., The impact of the Montreal Protocol on the developments in refrigeration and A/C (1998) Emerging Trends in Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning, IIR Conference, pp. 1-15. , 18–20 March, New Delhi, India; Lee, Y.S., Su, C.C., Experimental studies of isobutane (R600a) as the refrigerant in domestic refrigeration system (2002) Applied Thermal Engineering, 22 (5), pp. 507-519. , April; McLinden, M.O., Klein, S.A., Lemmon, E.W., Peskin, A.P., (1998) Thermodynamic Properties of Refrigeration and Refrigerant Mixtures Database, , REFPROP V.6.01, NIST; Meyer, A., Hydrocarbon blends in small scale refrigeration appliances (1966) International Conference on Ozone Protection Technologies, pp. 88-93. , October, Washington DC; Mohanraj, M., Jayarajand, S., Muraleedharan, C., Comparative assessment of environment-friendly alternatives to R134a in domestic refrigerators (2008) Journal of Energy Efficiency, 1 (3), pp. 189-198. , Springer Links August; Sattar, M.A., Saidur, R., Masjuki, H.H., Performance investigation of domestic refrigerator using pure hydrocarbons and blends of hydrocarbons as refrigerants (2007) Proceedings of World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 23, pp. 223-228. , August, ISSN 1307-6884; Sekhar, S.J., Mohan Lal, D., Renganarayanan, S., Improved energy efficiency for CFC domestic refrigerators retrofitted with ozone friendly HFC134a/HC refrigerant mixture (2004) International Journal of Thermal Sciences, 43 (3), pp. 307-314. , March; Senthil Kumar, K., Rajagopal, K., Computational and experimental investigation of low ODP and low GWP HCFC-123 and HC-290 refrigerant mixture alternate to CFC-12 (2007) Energy Conversion and Management, 48 (12), pp. 3053-3062. , December; Shrestha, S.B., Srinivasa Murthy, S., Application of isobutane-propane mixtures for heating and combined heating and cooling in vapour compression system (2001) Proceeding of IECEC‘01, 36th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference, pp. 1-3. , 29 July–2 August, Savannah, Georgia; Srinivasa Murthy, S., Refrigerant mixtures: fundamentals and applications (2004) Workshop on Advanced Refrigeration Systems, IIT Madras, pp. 1-14. , 9 January","Srinivas, P.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, MVSR Engineering College, Nadergul, Hyderabad 501 510, Andhra Pradesh, India",,,,,,,,17582083,,,,"English","Int.
