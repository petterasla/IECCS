This type of C fixation might be helpful to prevent the global warming. In year 2000, the amount of C fixation in the wooden materials was approximately 7.3% (150 million C ton) of total forest C accumulation in Japan, whereas in Korea, it was 2.0% (4.3 million C ton) of the total forest C accumulation. The reason is that structural types of the house units on wood utilization in Japan and Korea are clearly different. Japanese have used 90% of wooden materials for their residence houses but Korean house units have built mostly using non-wooden materials such as concrete, bricks, and stones. It has resulted that the number of total houses in Japan is 5 times higher than that in Korea, whereas the amount of C fixed by the wood materials in Japanese house units is 35 times higher than in Korean's. Therefore, to improve C fixation, it might be necessary to increase wooden residence houses and use of the wooden interior or exterior materials in the residence houses, especially in Korea.",,,,,,,,"Arima, T., Life recycling of the wooden house and environmental preservation (1991) Wood Industry, 46 (12), pp. 635-640. , in Japanese; Arima, T., (2002) Recycling Society and Wood, pp. 15-30. , All Japan Association of Kenchikushis. in Japanese; Choi, S.I., Sakai, M., Estimation of the carbon stock function of house in Japan and Korea (2002) 2nd International Joint Seminar on Forestry and Forest Products Science, pp. 101-102. , Organized by College of Agriculture Chonbuk National University Korea; Kim, W.J., Bae, J.S., Choi, Y.S., Jung, H.H., Sung, K.C., Lee, B.I., Kim, J.S., Koo, T.W., (2000) The Collecting System, for Enhancement of Wastewood Recycling, pp. 58-63. , Korea Forest Research Institute, in Korean; Mitsuhashi, T., (1997) Economics of the Forest and CO2, pp. 214-218. , PHP Institute Office Int'l, Inc. in Japanese; Morita, M., (1994) Forest Products Economics, pp. 16-18. , Buneido Publishing Co., Ltd, in Japanese; (1998) Important Roles of Forest and Wood Products in Combating Climate Change, pp. 116-129. , Nihon Ringyou Chosakai. in Japanese; (2002), http://www.nso.go.kr, OnlineOkazaki, Y., Okuma, M., Evaluation of wooden house construction from the standpoint of carbon stock and CO2 emission (1998) Wood Industry, 53 (4), pp. 161-165. , in Japanese; Okuma, M., Evaluation of wood utilization from the standpoint of carbon stock and CO2 balance (1998) Wood Industry, 53 (4), pp. 54-59. , in Japanese; The subject of the housing supply ratio 100% times (2000) CEO Information, 233, pp. 1-24. , in Korean; (2002), http://www.stat.go.jp, Online(2001) The Total Plan to Japanese Reproduction, pp. 182-192. , Asahi Shimbun Publishing, in Japanese; Tonosaki, S., Wood as an environmental material (1999) Wood Industry, 54 (11), pp. 511-515. , in Japanese; Yorimitsu, R., (1999) The Century of the Forest and Environment, pp. 34-41. , Nihon Keizai Hyoronsha Ltd, in Japanese","Choi, S.I.; Div.
