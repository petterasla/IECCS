Reflectance and transmittance measurements of abaxial and adaxial surfaces were obtained at ca 0.3 nm spectral resolution from 400-800 nm, and binned to simulate Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. There were no significant differences in optical properties between the two surfaces. Ozone-damaged needles were collected from Jeffrey pine trees at one site, and exhibited significantly different (family-wise α = 0.01) reflectance and transmittance signatures - and significantly different signature slopes - at both spectral resolutions, from green and winter fleck needles from the same site. Ozone-damaged needles had significantly different (family-wise α = 0.01) abaxial surface reflectance and reflectance slope signatures from all other groups of needles, at both spectral resolutions. In comparison with three chlorophyll reflectance indices, a new red fall index (RFI) provides high classification accuracies for ozone-damaged and non-ozone-damaged pine needles (overall acc. = 94%; κ = 59%). Thus, ozone-damaged Jeffrey pine needles have a unique spectral signature in relation to dominant needle conditions of ponderosa and Jeffrey pine trees. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",,"Classification accuracy; Infrared imaging spectrometer; Insect damage; Jeffrey pine; Pine needle; Random mixtures; Reflectance index; Sierra Nevada; Spectral signature; Surface reflectance; Transmittance measurements; Chlorophyll; Optical properties; Ozone; Porphyrins; Reflection; Spectral resolution; Thermography (imaging); Needles; AVIRIS; coniferous tree; leaf; reflectance; spectral analysis; spectral resolution; transmittance; California; North America; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Hemiptera; Hexapoda; Pinus jeffreyi",,,,,,"Rbaugh, M., Bytnerowicz, A., Grulke, N., Fenn, M., Poth, M., Temple, P., Miller, P., Photochemical smog effects in mixed conifer forests along a natural gradient of ozone and nitrogen deposition in the San Bernardino Mountains (2003) Environment International, 29, pp. 401-406; Aspinall, R.J., Use of logistic regression for validation of maps of the spatial distribution of vegetation species derived from high spatial resolution hyperspectral remotely sensed data (2002) Ecological Modelling, 157, pp. 301-312; Carroll, J.J., Miller, P.R., Pronos, J., Historical perspectives on ambient ozone and its effects on the Sierra Nevada (2003) Developments in Environmental Science 2, pp. 33-54. , A.
