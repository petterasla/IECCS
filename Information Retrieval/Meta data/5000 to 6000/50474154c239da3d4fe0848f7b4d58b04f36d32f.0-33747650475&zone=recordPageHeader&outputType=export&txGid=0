There is a steady decline with age in whether respondents are willing to incur higher gasoline prices to protect the environment. This relationship remains after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. There are age-related differences in information about environmental risks, information sources about the environment, perceived health risks from climate change, and degree of worry about climate change. However, taking these factors into account does not eliminate the age variation in willingness to pay more for gasoline to protect the environment. © Springer 2006.",,"Environmental protection; Health risks; Public policy; Risk assessment; Environmental policies; Generational divide; Socioeconomic characteristics; Environmental engineering; age class; climate change; environmental policy; environmental risk; health risk; socioeconomic conditions; survey; willingness to pay; Eurasia; Europe",,,,,,"Adams, J., (1995) Risk, , University College London Press, London; Aldy, J.E., Barrett, S., Stavins, R.N., Thirteen plus one: A comparison of global climate policy architectures (2003) Climate Policy, 3, pp. 373-397; Barrett, S., (2003) Environment and State Craft, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Berk, R.A., Fovell, R.G., Public perceptions of climate change: A ""willingness to pay"" assessment (1999) Climatic Change, 41 (3-4), pp. 413-446; Bostrom, A., Morgan, M.G., Fischhoff, B., Read, D., What do people know about global climate change?: 1.
