Given recent poleward range extension of the barrens-forming sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) from mainland Australia to Tasmania, there is a need to understand the population dynamics of this ecologically important species in the Tasmanian environment. This paper informs possible population dynamics of C. rodgersii in Tasmania by examining its reproductive ecology in this new environment. Reproductive periodicity (gonad index and propensity to spawn) was assessed bimonthly over 18 months at four sites in eastern Tasmania spanning ∼2° in latitude. At all sites, C. rodgersii displayed a strong seasonal cycle in gonad production with major spawning occurring in winter (∼August) at minimum annual water temperature. Gametes from Tasmanian C. rodgersii were viable as determined by fertilization and early development trials. However, development to the two-arm stage at ∼3 weeks was strongly dependent on water temperature across the 8-20 °C temperature range, with poor development occurring below 12 °C. The range of temperatures tolerated by Tasmanian C. rodgersii larvae was similar to that of larvae from its native New South Wales range, indicating that this species has not undergone an adaptive shift to the cooler Tasmanian environment. There was also no evidence for an adaptive shift in reproductive phenology. Importantly, coastal water temperatures in eastern Tasmania during the peak spawning in August fluctuate about the 12 °C larval development threshold. Recent warming of the eastern Tasmanian coast and further warming predicted by global climate change will result in an environment increasingly favourable for the reproduction and development of C. rodgersii. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Centrostephanus rodgersii; Climate change; Gonad index; Larval development; Macroalgae; Poleward range shift; Reproductive phenology; Temperate rocky reef; Temperature threshold; Urchin barrens","climate change; echinoderm; ecosystem dynamics; larval development; macroalga; marine ecosystem; phenology; population dynamics; reproductive potential; spawning; water temperature; Australasia; Australia; Tasmania; Centrostephanus rodgersii; Diadematidae; Echinoidea",,,,,,"Andrew, N.L., Changes in subtidal habitat following mass mortality of sea urchins in Botany Bay, New South Wales (1991) Australian Journal of Ecology, 16, pp. 353-362; Andrew, N.L., Spatial heterogeneity, sea urchin grazing, and habitat structure on reefs in temperate Australia (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 292-302; Andrew, N.L., Byrne, M., The ecology of Centrostephanus rodgersii (2001) Edible Sea Urchins: Biology and Ecology, , In: (ed; Elsevier Science, pp. 149-160. , Lawrence JM) New York; Andrew, N.L., O'Neill, A.L., Large-scale patterns in habitat structure on subtidal rocky reefs in New South Wales (2000) Marine and Freshwater Research, 51, pp. 255-263; Andrew, N.L., Underwood, A.J., Patterns of abundance of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii on the central coast of New South Wales, Australia (1989) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 131, pp. 61-80; Andrew, N.L., Underwood, A.J., Density-dependent foraging in the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii on shallow subtidal reefs in New South Wales, Australia (1993) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 99, pp. 89-98; Barry, J.P., Baxter, C.H., Sagarin, R.D., Gilman, S.E., Climate-related, long-term faunal changes in a California rocky intertidal community (1995) Science, 267, pp. 672-675; Beaugrand, G., The North Sea regime shift: Evidence, causes, mechanisms and consequences (2004) Progress in Oceanography, 60, pp. 245-262; Blount, C., Worthington, D.G., Identifying individuals of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii with high-quality roe in New South Wales, Australia (2002) Fisheries Research, 58, pp. 341-348; Bradshaw, W.E., Holzapfel, C.M., Evolutionary response to rapid climate change (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1477-1478; Byrne, M., Andrew, N.L., Worthington, D.G., Brett, P.A., Reproduction in the diadematoid sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii in contrasting habitats along the coast of New South wales, Australia (1998) Marine Biology, 132, pp. 305-318; Cai, W.J., Shi, G., Cowan, T., Bi, D., Ribbe, J., The response of southern annular mode, the East Australian Current, and the southern midlatitude ocean circulation to global warming (2005) Geophysical Research Letters Doi:., 32, pp. L2370. , doi:; Chevaldonné, P., Lejeusne, C., Regional warming-induced species shift in north-west Mediterranean marine caves (2004) Ecology Letters, 6, pp. 371-379; Coppard, S.E., Campbell, A.C., Lunar periodicities of diadematid echinoids breeding in Fiji (2005) Coral Reefs, 24, pp. 324-332; Dartnall, A.J., (1980) Tasmanian Echinoderms.
