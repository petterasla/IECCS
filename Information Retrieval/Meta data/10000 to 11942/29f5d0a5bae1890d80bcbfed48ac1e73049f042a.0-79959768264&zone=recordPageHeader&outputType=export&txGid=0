By comparing these results with data from ODP Site 851 in the eastern equatorial Pacific, this study has reconstructed the paleoceanographic changes in upper ocean waters in the equatorial Pacific since 2. 5 Ma. During the period from 1.6-1.4 Ma, the oxygen isotopes of surface and subsurface waters were found to markedly change in the western and eastern equatorial Pacific, further confirming the final formation of the well-defined asymmetric east-west (E-W) pattern at that time. This feature was similar to the zonal temperature gradient (sea surface temperature is higher in the west and lower in the east) and the asymmetric upper water structure (thermocline depth is deeper in the west and shallower in the east) in the modern equatorial Pacific. The zonal gradient change of subsurface water δ18O was greater than that of surface water δ18O, indicating that the formation of the asymmetric E-W pattern in the equatorial Pacific should be much more related to the shoaled thermocline and markedly decreased subsurface water temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Moreover, since ~1. 6 Ma, the carbon isotopic differences between surface and subsurface waters clearly decreased in the equatorial Pacific, and their long-term eccentricity periods changed from 400 ka to ~500 ka, reflecting the reorganization of the ocean carbon reservoir. This probably resulted from the deep water reorganization in the Southern Ocean at that time and its enhanced influence on the tropical Pacific (especially subsurface water). Our study demonstrates that the tropical ocean plays an important role in global climate change. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","early Pleistocene; east-west asymmetric pattern; equatorial Pacific; oxygen and carbon isotopes; subsurface water","Foraminifera",,,,,,"Yan, X.H., Hou, C., Zheng, Q., Temperature and size variabilities of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (1992) Science, 58, pp. 1643-1645; Cane, M., A role for the tropical Pacific (1998) Science, 282, pp. 59-61; Webster, P., Magana, V., Palmer, T., Monsoon: process, predictability and the prospects for prediction (1998) J Geophys Res, 103, pp. 14451-14510; Wara, M.W., Ravelo, A.C., Delaney, M.L., Permanent El Niño-like conditions during the Pliocene warm period (2005) Science, 309, pp. 758-761; Lawrence, K.T., Liu, Z., Herbert, T.D., Evolution of the Eastern Tropical Pacific through Plio-Pleistocene glaciation (2006) Science, 312, pp. 79-83; Ravelo, A.C., Andreasen, D.H., Lyle, M., Regional climate shifts caused by gradual global cooling in the Pliocene epoch (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 263-267; Hodell, D.A., Venz-Curtis, K.A., Late Neogene history of deepwater ventilation in the Southern Ocean (2006) Geochem Geophys Geosys, 7, pp. Q09001; Fedorov, A.V., Dekens, P.S., McCarthy, M., The Pliocene paradox (mechanisms for a permanent El Niño) (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1485-1489; Wang, P.X., Tian, J., Lourens, L.J., Obscuring of long eccentricity cyclicity in Pleistocene oceanic carbon isotope records (2010) Earth Planet Sci Lett, 290, pp. 319-330; McPhaden, M.J., Busalacchi, A.J., Cheney, R., The tropical ocean-global atmosphere observing system: A decade of progress (1998) J Geophys Res, 103, pp. 14169-14240; Li, C., Mu, M., El Niño occurrence and subsurface ocean temperature anomalies in the Pacific warm pool (1999) Chin J Atmos Sci, 23, pp. 513-521; Xu, J., Holbourn, A., Kuhnt, W., Changes in the thermocline structure of the Indonesian outflow during Terminations I and II (2008) Earth Planet Sci Lett, 273, pp. 152-162; An, Y., Jian, Z.M., Pulleniatina Minimum Event during the last deglaciation in the southern South China Sea (2009) Chinese Sci Bull, 54, pp. 4514-4519; Ravelo, A.C., Shackleton, N.J., Evidence for surface-water circulation changes at Site 851 in the eastern tropical Pacific ocean (1995) Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Scientific Results, 138, pp. 503-514; Prentice, M.L., Friez, J.K., Simonds, G.G., Neogene trends in planktonic foraminifer δ18O from site 807: Implications for global ice volume and western equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures (1993) Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Scientific Results, 130, pp. 281-283; Lisiecki, L.E., Raymo, M.E., A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic δ18O records (2005) Paleoceanography, 20, pp. PA1003; Bé, A.W.H., (1977) An Ecological, Zoogeographic and Taxonomic Review of Recent Planktonic Foraminifera, pp. 1-100. , A.
