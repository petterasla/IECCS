Basically, CO2 can be sequestered in geological media: 1) through enhanced oil recovery (EOR), 2) by storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, 3) through replacement by CO2 of methane in deep coal beds (ECBMR), 4) by injection into deep saline aquifers, and 5) by storage in salt caverns. Criteria in assessing the suitability of a sedimentary basin for CO2 sequestration are: a) tectonism and geology, b) the flow of formation water and geothermal regime, and c) the existence of storage media (hydrocarbon reservoirs, coal seams, deep aquifers and salt structures). Generally, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is suitable for CO2 sequestration by all means because it is tectonically stable, it has regional-scale aquifers confined by aquitards or aquicludes, and it has oil and gas reservoirs in various stages of depletion, uneconomic coal seams, and extensive salt beds. However, various regions in the basin have different degrees of suitability, ranging from not suitable along the eastern edge of the basin, to extremely suitable in southwestern and central Alberta. Most major CO2 producers, such as power plants and refineries around Edmonton, are found in regions that are unsuitable for CO2 sequestration in geological media; however, some, such as the oil sands plants in the Athabasca area, are in regions that are not suitable. This analysis of the suitability of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin for CO2 sequestration in geological media should provide industry and governments with essential information needed for developing plans and policies in response to climate change effects of anthropogenic green-house gas emissions into the atmosphere.",,"Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Enhanced recovery; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Petroleum reservoirs; Public policy; Sedimentary rocks; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Geological sequestration; Sedimentary basin; Natural resources exploration",,,,,,"Bryant, E., (1997) Climate Process and Change, p. 209. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Jepma, C.J., Munasinghe, M., (1998) Climate Change Policy, p. 331. , Cambridge University Press, New York; (1991) IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), Climate Change: The IPCC Response Strategies, p. 272. , Island Press, Washington, D.C; Bajura, R.A., The role of carbon dioxide sequestration in the long term energy future (2001) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT-5), pp. 52-58. , (eds.
