The modeling was based on the transgressing soil-landscape concept and data collected from sampling units along two marsh transects in Dorchester County, Maryland. In low-relief submerging environments, coastal marshes accrete vertically and migrate laterally over adjacent Ultisols to keep pace with sea-level rise. The marsh substrate is organic in nature overlying what once were upland forest soils. The history of relative sea-level rise was a two-step linear function illustrating acceleration in the last two centuries. During the lastl50 yr, the 210Pb-based rate of relative sea-level rise averaged 2.4 ± 0.7 mm yr -1. Before the last few hundred years, the long-term 14C-based rate of relative sea-level rise was 0.82 ±0.15 mm yr -1. The rate of lateral migration of coastal marshes(deforestation) showed similar acceleration following the history of relative sea-level rise. During the last 150 yr, the average rate of lateral migration of marshes(deforestation) ranged from 3.51 ± 2.0 to 6.78 ± 7.4 m yr -1. Before the lastl50 yr, the average long-term rate of lateral migration of marshes(deforestation) ranged between 0.18 ± 0.07 and 1.27 ± 1.2 m yr -1. Within a given region where sea-level rise and tidal range remain constant, the rate of lateral migration of marshes is a function of site characteristics and the slope of the adjacent uplands. The predicted rate of lateral migration of marshes in the next century ranges from 3.2 to 33 m yr -1, averaging 14 ± 11 m yr -1. Assuming that the present rate of relative sea-level rise remains constant, the time needed to complete the pedogenic transformation of Ultisols to Histosols is 180 ± 35 yr. The most conservative future scenario of sea-level rise has reduced this time by 63%. The projected sequestration of C, total N, and pyrite in the newly formed coastal marshes during the next 100 yr average 231 ± 124, 11.7 ± 6.30, and 6.63 ± 3.57 Mg ha -1, respectively. These projections are half the nutrient sequestration potential of existing coastal marshes. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Average rates; Chesapeake bays; Coastal areas; Coastal marshes; Environmental implications; Forest soils; Histosols; Lateral migrations; Linear functions; Marsh soils; Maryland; Nutrient sequestrations; Relative sea levels; Sampling units; Sea-level rise; Site characteristics; Tidal ranges; Ultisols; Coastal zones; Deforestation; Geologic models; Global warming; Pyrites; Seawater; Soils; Tides; Wetlands; coastal zone; deforestation; environmental modeling; Histosol; pedogenesis; sea level change; transgression; Ultisol; Deforestation; Sea Water; Soil; Swamps; Tides; Wetlands; Dorchester County [Maryland]; Maryland; North America; United States",,,,,,"Adam, P., (1990) Salt marsh ecology.
