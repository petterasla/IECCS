In the experiment, the heat pipe is fabricated from the straight copper tube with the diameter and length of 10, 600 mm, respectively. The arrangements of the heat pipe sets are arranged in the staggered layout with the tube rows of 1, 2, 3. R134a refrigerant is used as working fluid in the heat pipe set for this present study. By comparing with a conventional air conditioning system, the air conditioning system with three rows of heat pipe gives the highest COP and EER with increasing of 6.4%, 17.5%, respectively. On the global warming and environment problems, the results of this study are expected to lead to guidelines that will allow the improved performance of the air conditioning systems which reduce its energy consumption. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
