Laboratory results were combined with industrial operational data to develop a site-specific life cycle assessment (LCA) model. Inoculated with active bacterial trophic groups, the anaerobic biodegradability of three starch-PVOH biopolymers achieved 58-62%. The LCA modeling showed that the environmental burdens of the starch-PVOH biopolymer packaging under AD conditions on acidification, eutrophication, global warming and photochemical oxidation potential were dominated by atmospheric emissions released from substrate degradation and fuel combustion, whereas energy consumption and infrastructure requirements were the causes of abiotic depletion, ozone depletion and toxic impacts. Nevertheless, for this bio-packaging, AD of the starch-PVOH biopolymer combined with recycling of the cardboard emerged as the environmentally superior option and optimization of the energy utilization system could bring further environmental benefits to the AD process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Anaerobic digestion; Life cycle assessment; Starch-PVOH biopolymer","Abiotic depletion; Anaerobic biodegradability; Atmospheric emission; Energy utilization systems; Environmental benefits; Environmental burdens; Fuel combustion; Key parameters; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle assessment model; Operational data; Ozone depletion; Photochemical oxidation; Site-specific; Substrate degradation; Trophic group; Biodegradation; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Degradation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Eutrophication; Fuels; Global warming; Life cycle; Ozone; Ozone layer; Rating; Starch; Anaerobic digestion; fuel; polyvinyl alcohol; starch; acidification; alcohol; anoxic conditions; bacterium; biodegradation; combustion; data set; emission; energy conservation; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; global warming; inoculation; life cycle analysis; numerical model; oxidation; polymer; acidification; anaerobic digestion; article; biodegradability; combustion; energy consumption; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; inoculation; life cycle assessment; ozone depletion; packaging; photooxidation; priority journal; Anaerobiosis; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofuels; Biological Assay; Carbon; Environment; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Methane; Models, Chemical; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Product Packaging; Proteins; Starch; Time Factors; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,"polyvinyl alcohol, 37380-95-3, 9002-89-5; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; Biofuels; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Methane, 74-82-8; Polyvinyl Alcohol, 9002-89-5; Proteins; Starch, 9005-25-8",,,,"Alleman, J.E., (1998) Free Ammonia-Nitrogen Calculator & Information, , Purdue University; Angelidaki, I., Alves, M., Bolzonella, D., Borzacconim, L., Guwy, A.J., Kalyuzhnyi, S., Jenicek, P., Van Lier, J.B., Defining the biomethane potential (BMP) of solid organic wastes: a proposed protocol for batch assays (2008), In: 5th International Symposium of Anaerobic Digestion of Solid Waste and Energy Crops.
