During this period, heading date has become 0.7-1.9 days earlier per 10 years. Air temperatures during the booting stage (6-15 days before heading) decreased by 0.18 °C per 10 years even though the air temperature on a given calendar date has increased slightly. The estimated potential yield losses caused by cold damage have increased since the start of the study period. Thus, the advance in phonological events as a result of global warming is likely to increase the risk of future yield losses, and this has important implications for future adaptation strategies (breeding new cultivars and changing crop management strategies) to reduce the risk of cold damage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cold damage; Global warming; Phenological development; Risk analysis; Rural-urban temperature gradient; Simulation model","agricultural management; air temperature; climate change; cold tolerance; crop yield; future prospect; global warming; phenology; rice; risk assessment; rural-urban comparison; temperature gradient; yield response; Japan",,,,,,"Amano, T., Moriwaki, R., Studies on cool injuries with special reference to cultural improvements in rice plants.
