The paper seeks to tally the major improvements facilitated by integrated assessments in understanding the global warming problem and the crucial unresolved problems they currently face. The basic conclusion is that, as a result of a healthy diversity in practice, integrated assessments show significant progress in structuring the economic issues of climate change and providing the first broad insights into policy options. But, as some of the simple and traditional cases seem to be solved, more complex and difficult contingencies come to the fore. This suggests a long way to go to develop skills that will be required to address the numerous open issues. © 1995.","Climate change; Economics of mitigation and adaptation; Integrated assessments","climate change; economics; environmental assessment",,,,,,"Aaheim, (1994) Benefits and costs of climate measures under joint implementation, pp. 601-620. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Alcamo, van den Born, Bouwman, de Haan, Klein Goldewijk, Klepper, Klepper, van der Woerd, (1994) Modeling the global society-biosphere-climate system: computed scenarios, pp. 241-288. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Bashmakov, (1994) Russia — energy related greenhouse gas emissions: present and future, pp. 379-401. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Boyle, (1994) Toward a fossil free future: the technical and economic feasibility of phasing out global fossil fuel use, pp. 353-378. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Budyko, (1994) Global warming, pp. 87-92. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Dowlatabadi, Morgan, A model framework for integrated studies of the climate problem (1993) Energy Policy, 21 (3), pp. 209-221; Golitsyn, (1994) The Caspian Sea level rise: a case study of the impacts of climate change, pp. 93-102. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Halsnaes, MacKenzie, Swisher, (1994) Comparable assessment of national greenhouse gas abatement costs: results of ten country studies, pp. 641-656. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Hammitt, Lempert, Schlesinger, A sequential decision strategy for abating climate change (1992) Nature, 357, pp. 315-318; Hope, Anderson, Wenman, (1994) Policy analysis of greenhouse effect: an application of the PAGE model, pp. 119-142. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Kaya, Nakićenović, Nordhaus, Toth, (1993) Costs, Impacts, and Benefits of CO2 Mitigation, , International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, CP-93-2; Kolstad, (1994) Mitigating climate change impacts: the conflicting effects of irreversibilities in CO2 accumulation and emission control investment, pp. 205-218. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Kononov, (1994) Impacts of economic reforms in Russia on greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation, and adaptation, pp. 403-409. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Lempert, Schlesinger, Hammitt, (1994) The impact of potential abrupt climate changes on near-term policy choices, pp. 173-204. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Lind, A primer on the major issues relating to the discount rate for evaluating national energy options (1982) Discounting for Time and Risk in Energy Policy, pp. 21-94. , RC Lind, KL Arrow, GR Corey, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD; Maier-Reimer, Hasselmann, Transport and storage of carbon dioxide in the ocean an inorganic ocean circulation carbon cycle model (1987) Climate Dynamics, 2, pp. 63-90; Manne, Mendelsohn, Richels, (1994) MERGE: a Model for Evaluating Regional and Global Effects of GHG reduction policies, pp. 143-172. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Manne, Richels, (1992) Buying Greenhouse Insurance: The Economic Costs of CO2 Emission Limits, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Nakićenović, Nordhaus, Richels, Toth, (1994) Integrative Assessment of Mitigation, Impacts, and Adaptation to Climate Change, , International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, CP-94-9; Nishinomiya, Nishimura, (1994) The impacts of climate change on electric utilities in Japan, pp. 427-442. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Nordhaus, (1994) Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, Chapter 8; Parikh, (1994) Joint implementation and sharing commitments: a southern perspective, pp. 621-640. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; Peck, Teisberg, Global warming uncertainties and the value of information: an analysis using CETA (1994) Resources and Energy; Rosenzweig, Parry, Potential impact of climate change on world food supply (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 133-138; Rotmans, (1990) IMAGE: An Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect, , Kluwer, Dordrecht; Schotterer, Oeschger, (1994) The stability of the climate system in light of recent ice core measurements, pp. 75-86. , Nakićenović et al., 1994; The Economist (1989) Stratospheres, p. 79; Xia, Wei, (1994) Climate change and the technical and institutional adaptations: China's perspective, pp. 411-425. , Nakićenović et al., 1994","Toth, F.L.; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Potsdam, Germany",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029506326
