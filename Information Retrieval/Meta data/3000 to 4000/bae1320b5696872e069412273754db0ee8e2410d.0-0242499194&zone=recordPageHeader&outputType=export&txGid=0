The goal of this research is to model seasonal SeaWinds Ku-band backscatter in five savanna areas of Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil as a function of biophysical changes in the savanna landscape. Multiple regression modeling demonstrates that savanna Ku-band backscatter is a function of (1) savanna grass biomass/leaf area, (2) soil moisture, and (3) other soil characteristics. Fit for the regression models is excellent (R = 0.87 and 0.81, respectively, for the horizontal and vertical polarization case). The horizontal - vertical polarization difference is also moderately related to precipitation (R = 0.71). The results from this modeling are consistent with theory predicated on previous C- and X-band research. The possibility of monitoring savanna vegetation, soil moisture, and rainfall using Ku-band radar and scatterometry is discussed.",,"Backscattering; Climate change; Moisture; Soils; Tropics; Seawinds; Remote sensing; backscatter; environmental monitoring; grassland; leaf area; regression analysis; remote sensing; savanna; seasonal variation; soil moisture; Brazil; Colombia; Venezuela",,,,,,"Andrea, M.O., Biomass burning: Its history, use, and distribution and its impact on environmental quality and global climate (1991) Global Biomass Burning, pp. 3-21. , (J.S.
