The modeled region provides source water for the State Water Project and Central Valley Project of California. Four groups of the water planning simulation model CALSIM II run are implemented to isolate individual impacts of seasonal pattern shift of inflow to reservoirs, annual inflow volume change, and sea level rise on water supply in this region. Estimates of climate change impacts on water supply are made for the middle and end of the 21st century. These impacts are in terms of the ensemble means of CALSIM II simulation results for each of 12 climate model projections under the A2 or B1 emission scenario. The results indicate that around the middle of this century annual inflow changes contribute most to climate change impacts on water supply. But near the end of the century sea level rise of 61. cm in San Francisco Bay plays a major role in affecting water supplies. © 2011.","Climate change; Global warming; Water supply","Annual runoff; California; Climate change impact; Emission scenario; Four-group; Inflow to reservoir; Integrated effects; Ratio method; San Francisco Bay; Sea level rise; Seasonal patterns; Simulation model; Simulation result; Source waters; Volume change; Water planning; Water projects; Climate models; Computer simulation; Global warming; Perturbation techniques; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Sea level; Water supply; Seawater; climate modeling; environmental factor; global warming; inflow; integrated approach; numerical model; runoff; sea level change; seasonal variation; twenty first century; volume; water management; water planning; water resource; water supply; California; United States",,,,,,"(2006), http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/climatechange/DWRClimateChangeJuly06.pdf, California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Progress on Incorporating Climate Change into Management of California's Water Resources.
