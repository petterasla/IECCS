Flux measurements, taken in several ecosystems, show that soils are a substantial source of chloroform (8 ± 4 μg/m2/d) and a sink for methyl chloride (-10-3/+6 μg/m2/d). The known sources and sinks of these gases are insufficient to explain the observed concentrations. Our findings will help to balance the global budget of chloroform but may put the budget of methyl chloride further out of balance. We also found, consistent with previous research, that soils are a substantial source of nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide and take up hydrogen and methane. The uptake of man-made chlorocarbons was observed, but the rates are small. Observed fluxes of non-methane hydrocarbons showed few patterns except that soils may be a source of ethane and butane.","Atmosphere; Biota; Butane; CH4;; Chlorocarbons; Chloroform; CO2; Ethane; Gases; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Methyl chloride; N2O; Nitrous oxide; Ocean-air exchange; Ozone depletion; Soil-atmosphere exchange; Soils; Trace gases","butane; carbon monoxide; chlorinated hydrocarbon; chloroform; environmental monitoring; ethane; gas exchange; hydrogen; methane; methyl chloride; nitrous oxide; soil; air-soil interaction; chloroform; flux measurement; methyl chloride; source-sink dynamics; cellular organisms",,,,,,"Bremner, J.M., Blackmer, A.M., Nitrous oxide.
