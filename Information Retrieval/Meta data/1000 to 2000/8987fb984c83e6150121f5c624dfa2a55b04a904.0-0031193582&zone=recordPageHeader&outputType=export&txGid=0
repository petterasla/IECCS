Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are considered. Global average radiative forcing is used as a measure of the greenhouse impact caused by the emissions. Past emissions are included in the study because they have impact far into the future. The calculation method utilized in this study can be applied to any other country. Two hypothetical future emission development cases are presented, and the radiative forcing caused by them is calculated. In the higher emission (case A) CO2 emissions remain above current level, while N20 and CH4 emissions decrease. In the lower emission (case B) the emissions decrease to about one-tenth of the current emissions by the year 2100. OnIy if very strict emission reductions (case B) take place will the greenhouse impact of the Nordic countries return to current levels during next century. Likewise, the per capita radiative forcing of Nordic countries will remain above global average unless the emissions decrease drastically (case B) and the current population levels are used in per capita calculation.The possibility of decreasing the Nordic countries' contribution to global warming in the future is examined.
