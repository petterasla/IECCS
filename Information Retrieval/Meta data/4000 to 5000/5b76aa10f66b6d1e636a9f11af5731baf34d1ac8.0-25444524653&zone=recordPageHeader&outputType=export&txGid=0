Alternative energy source should be provided without producing more CO2, such as solar energy. One of the best routes to remedy CO 2 is to transform it to hydrocarbons using photo reduction. In our study, CO2 was photocatalytically reduced to produce methanol using a Hg lamp with wavelength 365 nm in a steady-state optical-fiber photo reactor. The optical-fiber photo reactor, comprised of near 120 Cu/TiO2-coated fibers, was designed and assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly inside reactor. TiO2 film was coated on optical fiber using dip-coating method. Titania and Cu-loaded solutions were prepared by a thermal hydrolysis method. The thickness of Cu/TiO2 film was 53 nm and consisted of very fine spherical particle with diameter of near 14 nm. The XRD spectra indicated the anatase phase of all TiO2 and Cu/TiO 2 films. The wavelength of absorption edge was on 367 nm, equivalent to near 3.3 eV. Most active Cu species on TiO2 surface were Cu 2O clusters, and played an important role for the formation of methanol. The methanol yield increased with UV irradiative intensity. Photo activity increased with increasing Cu loadings. Maximum methanol rate was 0.45 μmole/g-cat•hr using 1.2 wt%-Cu/TiO2 catalyst under 16 W/cm2 irradiation, 1.3 bar pressure of CO2, and 5000 seconds mean residence time. Higher than 1.2 wt% Cu loading gave less rate of methanol yield because of the masking effect of Cu2O clusters on the surface of TiO2.",,,,,,,,"Laws, E.A., Berning, J.L., Photosynthetical efficiency optimization studies with the macroalga cracilaria tikvihae: Implications for CO2 emission control from power plants (1991) Bioresource Technology, 37, p. 25; Yamashita, H., Fujii, Y., Ichihashi, Y., Zhang, S.G., Ikeue, K., Park, D.R., Koyano, K., Anpo, M., Selective formation of CH3 OH in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O on titanium oxides highly dispersed within zeolites and mesoporous molecular sieves (1998) Catalysis Today, 45, p. 221; Kuwabata, S., Nishida, K., Tsuda, R., Inoue, H., Yoneyama, H., Photochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Methanol Using ZnS Microcrystallite as a Photocatalyst in the Presence of Methanol Dehydrogenase (1994) J.
