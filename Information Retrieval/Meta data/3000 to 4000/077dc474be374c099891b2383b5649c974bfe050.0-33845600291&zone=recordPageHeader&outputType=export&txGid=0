Because of non freon refrigerants, they have no ozone depletion problems and a negligible global warming potential. According to the properties of the newly developed metal hydrides and the characteristics of the metal hydride heat pump/air-conditioner system, the prototype machine using hot oil as heat source is designed aiming to replace traditional bus air conditioner. The system has two reactors in which two kinds of metal hydrides La0.6Y0.4Ni4,8Mn 0.2 and LaNi4.61Mn0.26Al0.13 were used as hydrogen desorption and absorption in each reaction bed. Its refrigeration capacity and COP were theoretically calculated to be 1 034 W and 0.41 under the operating temperatures of 150°C,40°C,20°C with 10 min cycling time.","Air-conditioner; Heat pump; Metal-hydride",,,,,,,,"Liu, H.; Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, CAS, Beijing 100080, China; email: hjliu@cl.cryo.ac.cn",,,,,,,,1002185X,,XJCGE,,"English","Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845600291
