This paper intends to describe a simplified renewed procedure for the analysis and selection of materials capable of providing fast and reliable information to those designers that are interested to minimize the life-cycle environmental burden of products and services, the so called EcoAudirt. The here presented EcoAudit procedure assesses the nurden associated to a component/product by means of a customizet set of environmental impact indicators, without exploring all parameters that are usually provided by a LCA study. The set of environmental impact indicators that are here adopted for this prupose are the energy consumption (energy breakdown in terms of direct and indirect contrinutors, MJ per fuctional unit), the global warming potential (in terms of CO2 equiv per fuctional unit) and the end of liife possibilities (in terms of effective parcticable scenarios, i.e. of recycling). The first two indicators may be intendes as "" key environmental performance indicators"" (""KEPIs""). This approach allows a fast preliminary ranking of materials and processes identifying the most relevant critical phases of a systedm, making the ecodesign process really starting. The integration within the Cambridge Engineering Selector 2009 EcoAudit tool allows to search and browse materials data, calculating the environmental load in a real time. ©2010 The Japan Institute of Metals.","EcoAudit; Ecodesign; Impact indicators; Life cycle analysis; Material selection","Cambridge; Critical phasis; Design process; Ecodesign; Energy consumption; Environmental burdens; Environmental loads; Environmental performance indicators; Global warming potential; Impact indicators; Life cycle analysis; Material choice; Material selection; Materials and process; Products and services; Real time; Simplified procedure; Benchmarking; Environmental management; Global warming; Life cycle; Materials; Environmental impact",,,,,,"Thackara, J., (2005) In the Bubble, Design in A Complex World, , MIT Press (ISBN 0-262-20157-7); (2005) 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, , Energy Using Products Directive 6 July; Umezawa, O., Halada, K., Shinohara, Y., (2007) Mater.
