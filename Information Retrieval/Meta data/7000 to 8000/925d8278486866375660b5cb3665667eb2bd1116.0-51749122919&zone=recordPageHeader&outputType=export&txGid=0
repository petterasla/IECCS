At present, the emission factors for CO2, NOx and SO2 are 3.5, 4.2 and 119 times higher than British refineries, respectively. In order to have a sustainable development in Iranian oil refineries, the government has to set emission factors of European Community as her goal. At present CO2 per Gross Domestic Production (GDP) in the country is about 2.7 kg CO2 as 1995's US$ value that should be reduced to 1.25 kg CO2/GDP in the year 2015. Total capital investment for such reduction is estimated at 346 million US$ which is equal to 23 US$/ton of CO2. It is evident that mitigation of funds set by Clean Development Mechanism (3 to 7 US$/tons of CO2) is well below the actual capital investment needs. Present survey shows that energy efficiency promotion potential in all nine Iranian oil refineries is about 165,677 MWh/year through utilization of more efficient pumps and compressors. Better management of boilers in all nine refineries will lead to a saving of 273 million m3 of natural gas per year. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Emission factor; Global warming; Iran; Oil refinery; Pollutants","Air quality; Emission factor; Global warming; Iran; Oil refinery; Pollutants; Petroleum refineries; carbon dioxide; natural gas; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; clean development mechanism; emission control; global warming; oil pollution; sustainable development; air pollution control; article; boiler; controlled study; cost control; Europe; funding; gas turbine power; government regulation; investment; Iran; oil industry; pump; sustainable development; United Kingdom; Air Pollutants; Environmental Remediation; Industry; Iran; Petroleum; Asia; Eurasia; Iran; Middle East",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; natural gas, 8006-14-2; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5; Air Pollutants; Petroleum",,,,"Abbaspour, M., Karbassi, A.R., Scenarios for GHGs reduction in oil sector in Iran during 50 next years (2006), First international conference on energy management and planning, Tehran - Iran(2005) Vehicle Fuel Economy Standards: Big Energy Savings at a Modest Const, , http://www.aceee.org/energy/cafe.htm, ACEEE American Council for and Energy Efficient Economy; Bernow, S., Dougherty, W., (2000) The Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol On Full Cost Transportation in the U.S., Social Costs and Sustainable Mobility, pp. 56-69. , ZEW Heidelberg: Physica-Verlag; Campbell, C., Laherrere, J., (1998) The End of Cheap Oil, pp. 78-83. , Scientific American, March 1998; Investigation on needs of technology transfer in oil industries in Iran (2003), CEERS Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies, Tehran, IranIntegrated pollution prevention and control (2003), p. 520. , EC IPPC, Reference document on Best Available Techniques for Mineral Oil and Gas Refineries, European Commission, Seville, SpainEllerman, A.D., Decaux, A., (1998) Analysis of Post-Kyoto Emissions Trading Using Marginal Abatement Curves, , MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change Report No. 40, October, Cambridge, MA; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. 117. , IPCC Cambridge University Press; (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. 176. , IPCC Cambridge University Press; (2003) Energy Balance in Iran, , Ministry of Energy Chapter of Environment.
