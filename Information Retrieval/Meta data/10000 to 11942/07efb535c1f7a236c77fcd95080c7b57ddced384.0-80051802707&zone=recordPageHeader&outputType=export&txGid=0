The plasma source can stably generate atmospheric thermal plasma not only by Ar but also by He, O2, N2, CO2, air, and their mixture gas. In this paper, the plasma source was applied for anesthetic gas decomposition including N2O, which is a kind of global warming gases. Atmospheric thermal plasma was generated by mixture gas of N2O, O2, and air. It corresponds to actual gas composition for up to three surgery exhaust. Spectroscopic characteristics of generated plasma and composition of treated gas were investigated. By using optimally shaped ICP torch, 99.9% of decomposition rate and 942 g/kWh of high energy efficiency were achieved. However, around 3% of NOx was generated as by-products due to high gas temperature. © 2011 IEEE.","Atmospheric pressure thermal plasma; nitrous oxide; plasma applications; waste gas treatment","Atmospheric thermal plasmas; Decomposition rate; Direct decomposition; Gas compositions; Gas decomposition; Gas temperature; High energy efficiency; Mixture gas; Nitrous oxide; Research groups; Spectroscopic characteristics; Thermal plasma; waste gas treatment; Anesthetics; Atmospheric pressure; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Inductively coupled plasma; Industrial research; Nitrogen oxides; Plasma applications; Plasma diagnostics; Plasma sources; Waste treatment; Gases",,,,,,"Ravishankara, A.R., Daniel, J.S., Portmann, R.W., Nitrous oxide (N2O): The dominant ozone-depleting substance emitted in the 21st century (2009) Science, 326 (5949), pp. 123-125. , Oct; Nojiri, Y., Akagi, J., Hatanaka, E., Hayabuchi, Y., Hirai, K., Itoh, H., Oda, T., White, M., National greenhouse gas inventory report of JAPAN (2010) Ministry of the Environment, , Tokyo, Japan, Apr; Aoki, H., Report on state-of-the-art N2O decomposition system (2004) J.
