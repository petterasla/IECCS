A life-cycle assessment of flash pyrolysis of wood waste was conducted to study whether a flash pyrolysis plant set up locally would be environmentally friendly. The results obtained show that the process of flash pyrolysis of wood waste is in fact environmentally friendly, and the process has little contribution to the environment. However, efforts still have to be made to address the global warming potential issue. Continuous research and developments must be carried out to further reduce the global warming potential of the flash pyrolysis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
