Recent research, using submarine-based observations, suggests that the Arctic ice cover was thinner in the 1990s compared to an earlier period (1958-1979), and that it continued to decrease in thickness in the 1990s. Here I analyze subsurface ice thickness (draft) of Arctic sea ice from six submarine cruises from 1991 to 1997. This extensive data set shows that there was no trend towards a thinning ice cover during the 1990s. Data from the North Pole shows a slight increase in mean ice thickness, whereas the Beaufort Sea shows a small decrease, none of which are significant. Transects between the two areas from 76° N to 90° N also show near constant ice thicknesses, with a general spatial decrease from the Pole towards the Beaufort Sea. Combining the present results with those of an earlier study, I conclude that the mean ice thickness has remained on a near-constant level around the North Pole from 1986 to 1997.",,"Climate change; Sea ice; Submarines; Thermal effects; Ice thickness; Geophysics; climate change; global warming; ice thickness; sea ice; temporal variation; Arctic Ocean",,,,,,"Haas, C., Eicken, H., Interannual variability of summer sea ice thickness in the Siberian and Central Arctic under different atmospheric circulation regimes (2000) J.
