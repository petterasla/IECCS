Models predict that predation should mitigate species responses to environmental change, and that interspecific competition should aggravate species responses to environmental change. To test this prediction, we studied how predation and competition affected the responses of two ciliates, Colpidium striatum and Paramecium tetraurelia, to temperature change in laboratory microcosms. We found that neither predation nor competition altered the responses of Colpidium striatum to temperature change, and that competition but not predation altered the responses of Paramecium tetraurelia to temperature change. Asymmetric interactions and temperature-dependent interactions may have contributed to the disparity between model predictions and experimental results. Our results suggest that models ignoring inherent complexities in ecological communities may be inadequate in forecasting species responses to environmental change.",,"competition (ecology); environmental change; interspecific interaction; predation; Ciliophora; Colpidium; Colpidium striatum; Paramecium; Paramecium tetraurelia",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Will small population sizes warn us of impending extinctions?
