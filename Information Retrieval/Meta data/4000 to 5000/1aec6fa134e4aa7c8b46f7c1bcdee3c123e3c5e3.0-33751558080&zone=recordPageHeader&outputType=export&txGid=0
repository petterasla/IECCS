However, available results are mainly based on the study of wild plants, whereas only a few studies have hinted at an earlier spring onset for agricultural plants. So far, no comprehensive study has compared phenological shifts between agricultural crops, fruit trees and wild plants. We analysed phenological time series of 93 phases in Germany (1951-2004) employing Bayesian nonparametric function estimation, and found that events related to the production of annual crops clearly differ from spring and summer events in wild plants and fruit trees. While non-farmer driven agricultural events and spring and summer growth stages of wild plants and fruit trees advanced (i.e. occurred earlier) by 4.4 to 7.1 d decade-1, farming indicators, such as sowing and subsequent emergence of spring and winter crops, as well as harvesting, advanced by only 2.1 d decade-1. The estimated functional behaviour and emergence of discontinuous changes are clearly different between the 2 groups. We conclude that phenological responses to temperature changes are only reflected in data of wild plants, fruit trees and those spring growth stages of winter crops and later growth stages of spring crops which are exclusively triggered by climate, while other changes due to agricultural production are subject to management practice alterations. © Inter-Research 2006.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Climate change impact; Germany; Phenology; Response; Temperature","Agriculture; Climate change; Environmental impact; Estimation; Production; Statistics; Thermal effects; agricultural production; Bayesian analysis; climate change; climate effect; crop plant; phenology",,,,,,"Chmielewski, F.M., Müller, A., Bruns, E., Climate changes and trends in phenology of fruit trees and field crops in Germany, 1961-2000 (2004) Agric For Meteorol, 121, pp. 69-78; De La Torre, C., Benoit, M., Changement climatique et observation à long terme an unités expérimentales: Évolution des pratiques agricoles et des réponses physiologiques des couverts végétaux (2004), www.avignon.inra.fr/internet/unites/unite_experimentales/agroclim/ Mission_MICCES/Journees_MICCES/Liste_Posters/version_index_html, Poster presented at Journées MICCES, l'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue.
