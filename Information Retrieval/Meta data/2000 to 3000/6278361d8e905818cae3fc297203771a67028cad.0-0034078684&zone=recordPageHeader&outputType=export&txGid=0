Changes in precipitation and increases in air temperature could impose additional stress on forests during the next century. For a study site in Carteret County, North Carolina, the General Circulation Model, HADCM2, predicts that by the year 2099, maximum air temperature will increase 1.6 to 1.9°C, minimum temperature will increase 2.5 to 2.8°C, and precipitation will increase 0 to 10 percent compared to the mid-1990s. These changes vary from season to season. We utilized a forest ecosystem process model, PnET-II, for studying the potential effects of climate change on drainage outflow, evapotranspiration, leaf area index (LAI) and forest Net Primary Productivity (NPP). This model was first validated with long term drainage and LAI data collected at a 25-ha mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) experimental watershed located in the North Carolina lower coastal plain. The site is fiat with poorly drained soils and high groundwater table. Therefore, a high field capacity of 20 cm was used in the simulation to account for the topographic effects. This modeling study suggested that future climate change would cause a significant increase of drainage (6 percent) and forest productivity (2.5 percent). Future studies should consider the biological feedback (i.e., stomata conductance and water use efficiency) to air temperature change.","Climate change; Drainage; Forest hydrology; Loblolly pine; Modeling; PnET-II","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; coniferous forest; hydrological response; plantation; productivity; United States",,,,,,"Aber, J.D., Federer, C.A., A generalized, lumped-parameter model of photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and net primary production in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems (1992) Oecologia, 92, pp. 463-474; Aber, J.D., Ollinger, S.V., Feder, C.A., Reich, P.B., Goulden, M.L., Kicklighter, D.W., Mello, J.M., Lathrop R.G., Jr., Predicting the effects of climate change on water yield and forest production in northeastern U.S (1995) Climate Research, 5, pp. 207-222; Aber, J.D., Reich, P.B., Goulden, M.L., Extrapolating leaf CO2 exchange to the canopy: A generalized model of forest photosynthesis validated by Eddy correlation (1996) Oecologia, 106, pp. 257-265; Albaugh, T.J., Allen, H.L., Dougherty, P.M., Kress, L.W., King, J.S., Leaf area and above-and below-ground growth responses of loblolly pine to nutrient and water additions (1998) Forest Science, 44 (2), pp. 1-12; Amatya, D.M., Skaggs, R.W., Gregory, J.D., Effects of controlled drainage on the hydrology of drained pine plantations in the North Carolina coastal plain (1996) J. of Hydrology, 181, pp. 211-232; Birdsey, R., Mickler, R., Sandlberg, D., Tinus, R., Zerbe, J., O'Brian, K., USDA forest service global change research program highlights: 1991-1995 (1995) General Tech.
