We put forward a geomatics-based systems engineering architecture to identify the location and extent of oil spills, thereby improving the ecological integrity of the world's oceans and helping contingency planners to determine required assets, personnel and other resources. This real-time, event-based and cost effective emergency management decision support system can aid in the classification, detection, and monitoring of oil spills in the marine environment. The developed Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) processing and calibration techniques efficiently monitor environmental changes in inaccessible ocean regions, characterize oil spill scenarios, and help to identify spill sources. The system is used to improve emergency management in the Gulf of Mexico, with application to oil spills arising from Hurricane Katrina. © Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","Coastal zone management; Geosensing systems engineering; Ocean security; SAR","Calibration techniques; Classification ,; Coastal zone management; Cost effective; Ecological integrity; Emergency management; Environmental change; Event-based; Geomatics; Gulf of Mexico; Hurricane katrina; Life support systems; Marine environment; Artificial intelligence; Biodiversity; Civil defense; Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Disasters; Ecology; Global warming; Hazardous materials spills; Management; Oceanography; Oil spills; Regional planning; Synthetic aperture radar; Systems engineering; Marine pollution",,,,,,"Andrew, L., Jian, F., Texture classification by wavelet packet signatures (1993) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 15 (11), pp. 1186-1191; Baraldi, A., Parmiggiani, F., An investigation of the textural characteristic associated with gray level concurrence matrix statistical parameters (1995) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 33 (2), pp. 293-304; Brekke, C., Solberg, A.H.S., Oil spill detection by satellite remote sensing (2005) Remote Sensing of Environment, 95 (1), pp. 1-13; Clausi, D.A., An analysis of co-occurrence texture statistics as a function of grey level quantization (2002) Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing, 28 (1), pp. 45-62; Delilah, H.A.A., (2002) Marine Oil Pollution Technologies and Methodologies for Detection and Early Warning, , I-21020, VA, Italy: European Commission Directorate General Joint Research Centre - ISPRA Institute for Protection and Security of the Citizen; Dell'Acqua, F., Gamba, P., Trianni, G., Semi-automatic choice of scale-dependent features for satellite SAR image classification (2006) Pattern Recognition Letters, 27 (4), pp. 244-251; El Zaart, A., Ziou, D., Benie, G.B., Wang, S., Jiang, Q., Oil spills detection in SAR imagery (1998) Department de Mathematiques et D'Informatique: Technical Report No. 211, , Quebec, Canada; (2005) CleanSeaNet a Near Real Time (NRT) Marine Oil Spill Detection Service by Using Radar Satellite Imagery, , http://cleanseanet.emsa.europa.eu/.Cited, EMSA, Available via DIALOG 10 Nov. 2009; Fingas, M.F., Brown, C.E., Review of oil spill remote sensing (1997) Spill Science and Technology Bulletin, 4, pp. 199-208; Gerard, M., Mallorqui, J.J., (2008) Scattering-Based Model of the SAR Signatures of Complex Targets for Classification Applications, p. 11. , International Journal of Navigation and Observation; Hovland, H.A., Johannessen, J.A., Digranes, G., Slick detection in SAR images (1994) International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, pp. 2038-2040; Huxtable, B.D., Jackson, C.R., Mansfield, A.W., Rais, H., Synthetic aperture radar processing system for search and rescue (1997) Proc.
