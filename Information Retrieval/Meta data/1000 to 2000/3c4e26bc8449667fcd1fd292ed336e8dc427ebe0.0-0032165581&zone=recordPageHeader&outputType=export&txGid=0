Dielectric films consisting of plasma enhanced chemically vapor deposited silicon dioxide and silicon nitride were comparatively etched in CF3I and C2F6/O2 plasma environments. The etch rate of these films was ascertained as a function of applied rf power, etchant gas flow rate, reaction chamber pressure, and CF3I: O2 ratio. Destruction efficiencies of CF3I at different processing parameters were evaluated. Depending on the flow rate, rf power, and chamber pressure, utilization efficiency of CF3I varied from as low as 10% to as high as 68%. CF4, C2F6, COF2, and CO2 were the predominant by-products found in the exhaust stream; however, their concentrations were very low compared to the traditional process employing C2F6/O2 mixtures.",,"Byproducts; Carbon dioxide; Chemical vapor deposition; Dielectric films; Etching; Exhaust gases; Pressure effects; Silica; Silicon nitride; Trifluoroiodomethane; Fluorine compounds",,,,,,"(1995) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Radiative Forcing of Climate Change - The 1995 Report of the Scientific Assessment Working Group of the IPCC; Ravishankara, A.R., Solomon, S., Turnipseed, A.A., Warren, R.F., (1993) Science, 259, p. 196; Maroulis, P., Langan, J., Johnson, A., Ridgeway, R., Withers, H., (1994) Semicond.
