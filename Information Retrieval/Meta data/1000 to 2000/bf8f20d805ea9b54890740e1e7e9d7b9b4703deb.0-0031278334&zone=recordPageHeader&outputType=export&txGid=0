Inst. for Rsrc. and Environ., Tsukuba 305, Japan","The absorption process of carbon dioxide from a single bubble to the surrounding liquid at elevated pressure is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Experiments are conducted in a laboratory-scale column through which the liquid flows downward to hold each injected bubble nearly stationary. The system is pressurized up to 0.6 MPa and sodium chloride is added to water. A simple theoretical model is used to simulate the basic features of the absorption dynamics for bubbles ascending in shallow ocean. The bubble size is found to initially decrease almost linearly with time. The addition of NaCl significantly reduces the absorption rate of CO2. An analysis of shape or surface oscillations of the bubble reveals that this effect arises from the suppression of wavy fluctuations along the gas-liquid interface. The model predicts that the rate of bubble size reduction is almost independent of time and pressure for bubbles larger than 1 mm, reproducing the experimental results reasonably well.The absorption process of carbon dioxide from a single bubble to the surrounding liquid at elevated pressure is studied both experimentally and theoretically.
