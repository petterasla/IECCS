However, warming may also enhance plant growth so that photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake may, in part, offset respiratory losses. To determine the effects of air and soil warming on CO2 exchange in tundra, we established an ecosystem warming experiment - the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project - in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range in Interior Alaska. We used snow fences coupled with spring snow removal to increase deep soil temperatures and thaw depth (winter warming) and open-top chambers to increase growing season air temperatures (summer warming). Winter warming increased soil temperature (integrated 5-40cm depth) by 1.5°C, which resulted in a 10% increase in growing season thaw depth. Surprisingly, the additional 2kg of thawed soil Cm-2 in the winter warming plots did not result in significant changes in cumulative growing season respiration, which may have been inhibited by soil saturation at the base of the active layer. In contrast to the limited effects on growing-season C dynamics, winter warming caused drastic changes in winter respiration and altered the annual C balance of this ecosystem by doubling the net loss of CO2 to the atmosphere. While most changes to the abiotic environment at CiPEHR were driven by winter warming, summer warming effects on plant and soil processes resulted in 20% increases in both gross primary productivity and growing season ecosystem respiration and significantly altered the age and sources of CO2 respired from this ecosystem. These results demonstrate the vulnerability of organic C stored in near surface permafrost to increasing temperatures and the strong potential for warming tundra to serve as a positive feedback to global climate change. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; NEE; Permafrost; Radiocarbon; Snowfence; Soil carbon; Thermokarst; Tundra; Warming","air temperature; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; global climate; permafrost; photosynthesis; radiocarbon dating; soil carbon; soil temperature; tundra; Alaska; United States",,,,,,"Impacts of a Warming Arctic (2004), ACIA Cambridge University Press, CambridgeAerts, R., Callaghan, T.V., Dorrepaal, E., van Logtestijn, R.S.P., Cornelissen, J.H.C., Seasonal climate manipulations result in species-specific changes in leaf nutrient levels and isotopic composition in a sub-arctic bog (2009) Functional Ecology, 23, pp. 680-688; Aerts, R., Cornelissen, J.H.C., Dorrepaal, E., Plant performance in a warmer world (2006) Plant Ecology, 182, pp. 65-77. , general responses of plants from cold, northern biomes and the importance of winter and spring events; Arft, A.M., Walker, M.D., Gurevitch, J., Responses of tundra plants to experimental warming (1999) Ecological Monographs, 69, pp. 491-511. , meta-analysis of the International Tundra Experiment; Bauer, J.E., Williams, P.M., Druffel, E.R.M., Recovery of submilligram quantities of carbon dioxide from gas streams by molecular sieve for subsequent determination of isotopic (13C and 14C) natural abundances (1992) Analytical Chemistry, 64, pp. 824-827; Biasi, C., Meyer, H., Rusalimova, O., Initial effects of experimental warming on carbon exchange rates, plant growth and microbial dynamics of a lichen-rich dwarf shrub tundra in Siberia (2008) Plant and Soil, 307, pp. 191-205; Borken, W., Davidson, E.A., Savage, K., Gaudinski, J., Trumbore, S.E., Drying and wetting effects on carbon dioxide release from organic horizons (2003) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 67, pp. 1888-1896; Brooks, P.D., Schmidt, S.K., Walker, D.A., Williams, M.W., Biogeochemistry of Snow-Covered Catchments (1995) The Niwot Ridge snow fence experiment, pp. 293-302. , biogeochmeical responses to changes in the seasonal snowpack.
