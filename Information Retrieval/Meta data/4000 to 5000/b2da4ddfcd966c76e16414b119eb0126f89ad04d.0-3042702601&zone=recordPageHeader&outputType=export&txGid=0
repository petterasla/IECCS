P., ESTEC, Noordwijk, Netherlands","One of the roles of the United Nations is to serve as a 'global conscience' and it has been inviting its Member States to give priority to addressing topics of global concern. One of the most debated and therefore best known initiatives is the 'Kyoto Agreement', dealing with the prevention of further man-induced global warming. Another similar UN initiative in recent years is designed to address the problems of the World's largest cities, or 'MegaCities', through a programme known as 'Habitat 21'. It is against this background that those involved in the ESA Technology Transfer Programme have been looking at how the Agency might be able to contribute to such initiatives by proposing space-derived and space-based technologies that can help to provide solutions. ESA's sponsorship of the publication in 2001 of the 'Megacities' book containing spectacular satellite remote-sensing imagery of the World's largest cities was seen as a first step in this direction. Designing the large conurbations of the future, as well as the individual buildings that will make them up, already presents a formidable challenge, and one where the latest space technologies can help to improve the daily lives of those who will live there. Within the ESA Technology Transfer Programme, therefore, we have also begun to examine the potential contribution that space technologies can make to the building sector. The target is to be able to propose a very different style of housing surpassing current 'eco-designs' as well as offering greater protection against natural disasters and environmental threats.",,"Aerospace industry; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Environmental impact; Global warming; Remote sensing; Satellite communication systems; Solar cells; Solar energy; Space telescopes; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Environmental threats; Natural disasters; Space technologies; Technology transfer programme (TTP); Space applications",,,,,,,"Gampe, F.; ESA Direct.
