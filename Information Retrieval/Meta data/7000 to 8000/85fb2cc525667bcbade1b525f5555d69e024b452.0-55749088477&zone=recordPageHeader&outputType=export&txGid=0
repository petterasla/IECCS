The committed warming is inferred from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates of the greenhouse forcing and climate sensitivity. The estimated warming of 2.4°C is the equilibrium warming above preindustrial temperatures that the world will observe even if GHG concentrations are held fixed at their 2005 concentration levels but without any other anthropogenic forcing such as the cooling effect of aerosols. The range of 1.4°C to 4.3°C in the committed warming overlaps and surpasses the currently perceived threshold range of 1°C to 3°C for dangerous anthropogenic interference with many of the climate-tipping elements such as the summer arctic sea ice, Himalayan-Tibetan glaciers, and the Greenland Ice Sheet. IPCC models suggest that ≈25% (0.6°C) of the committed warming has been realized as of now. About 90% or more of the rest of the committed warming of 1.6°C will unfold during the 21st century, determined by the rate of the unmasking of the aerosol cooling effect by air pollution abatement laws and by the rate of release of the GHGs-forcing stored in the oceans. The accompanying sea-level rise can continue for more than several centuries. Lastly, even the most aggressive CO2 mitigation steps as envisioned now can only limit further additions to the committed warming, but not reduce the already committed GHGs warming of 2.4°C. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Committed; Global warming","carbon dioxide; aerosol; climate change; greenhouse effect; industry; priority journal; review; solar radiation; urban area; Aerosols; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Pollution; Forecasting; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Human Activities; Temperature",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Aerosols; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Fossil Fuels",,,,"(1990) Targets and Indicators of Climate Change, , Rijsberman FJ, Stewart RJ, eds, Environment Institute, Stockholm; (2007) New Impetus for Climate Policy: Making the Most of Germany's Dual Presidency, , German Advisory Council on Global Change , Germany Advisory Council on Global Change, Berlin, WBGU Policy Paper 5; (2007) Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Limiting Global Climate Change to 2°C the Way Ahead for 2020 and Beyond, , Commission of European Communities , European Union, Brussels; Hansen, J., Dangerous human-made interference with climate: A GISS model study (2007) Atmos Chem Phys, 7, pp. 2287-2312; Schneider, S.H., Mastrandrea, M.D., Probabilistic assessment of ""dangerous"" climate change and emissions pathways (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 15728-15735; Lenton, T.M., Tipping elements in the Earth's climate system (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 1786-1793; Roe, G.H., Baker, M.B., Why is climate science so unpredictable?
