Fortunately, much of the country is sparsely populated; hence risk from these hazardous processes is localized to small areas adjacent to the Canada- US border, where most Canadians live. The greatest risk comes from earthquakes and landslides on the populated south coast of British Columbia and parts of southern Ontario and Québec; from floods in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, or Toronto; and from hurricanes in Halifax and St. John's. In the long term, Canada's coastlines are threatened by sea-level rise and Canada's northern indigenous peoples are threatened by permafrost thaw caused by global warming.",,"British Columbia; Calgary; Halifax; Hazardous process; Indigenous people; Natural hazard; Natural process; Ontario; Planet earth; Sea level rise; Severe storms; Small area; Snow avalanche; Toronto; Volcanic eruptions; Avalanches (snowslides); Earthquakes; Floods; Global warming; Hurricanes; Landslides; Storms; Volcanoes; Earth (planet); coastal zone; earthquake; flooding; global warming; hazard assessment; hazard management; hurricane; indigenous population; landslide; permafrost; risk assessment; sea level change; socioeconomic impact; thawing; tsunami; volcanic eruption; Canada",,,,,,"Abromelt, D., Deveraux, A.M., Overby, D., (2004) Avalanche basics, , http://www.fsavlanche.org, United States Forest Service, National Avalanche Centre, accessed 16 July 2009; Adams, J., Basham, P., The seismicity and seismotectonics of Canada east of the Cordillera (1989) Geoscience Canada, 16, pp. 3-16; Adams, J., Basham, P., Seismicity and seismic hazards (2001) A Synthesis of Geological Hazards in Canada, 548, pp. 7-25. , in Brooks, G.R., ed, Geological Survey of Canada, Bulletin; Andrews, J., (1993) Flooding-Canada Water Book, p. 171. , Environment Canada, Ottawa, ON; Andrews, J.T., Present and postglacial rates of uplift for glaciated northern and eastern North America derived from postglacial uplift curves (1970) Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 7, pp. 703-715; Atwater, B.F., Hemphill-Haley, E., (1997) Recurrence Intervals for Great Earthquakes of the Past 3500 years at Northeastern Willapa Bay, p. 108. , Washington, United States Geological Survey, Professional Paper 1576; Atwater, B.F., Nelson, A.R., Clague, J.J., Carver, G.A., Yamaguchi, D.K., Bobrowsky, P.T., Bourgeois, J., Reinhart, M.A., Summary of coastal geologic evidence for past great earthquakes at the Cascadia subduction zone (1995) Earthquake Spectra, 11, pp. 1-18; Atwater, B.F., Musumi-Rokkaku, S., Satake, K., Tsuji, Y., Ueda, K., Yamguchi, D.K., (2005) The Orphan Tsunami of 1700: Japanese Clues to a Parent Earthquake in North America, p. 133. , United States Geological Survey, Professional Paper 1707; Berninghausen, W.H., (1968) Tsunamis and Seismic Seiches Reported from the Western North and South Atlantic and the Coast Waters of Northwestern Europe, p. 49. , United States National Oceanographic Office, Informal Report 68-85; Bolt, B.A., (2003) Earthquakes, p. 378. , (5th edition), W.H.
