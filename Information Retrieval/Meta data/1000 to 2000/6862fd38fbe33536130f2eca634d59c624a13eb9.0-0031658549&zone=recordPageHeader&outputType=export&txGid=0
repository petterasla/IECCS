By fitting the 14C age with the high precise calibrated curve of tree ring, it is concluded that the date of the last large eruption is (1215 ± 15) AD. In addition, the climatic effects of that large eruption are also discussed, pointing out that the last large eruption probably corresponds to the sulfuric acid peak at (1227 ± 2) AD in GISP2 Greenland ice core.","14C dating; Changbaishan-Tianchi volcano; Date of large eruption; Global climate change",,,,,,,"Liu, R., Li, J., Wei, H., Changbaishan-Tianchi volcano: A recent volcano with danger of eruption (1992) Acta Geophysical Sinica (in Chinese), 35 (5), p. 661; Liu, R., Wei, H., Li, J., (1995) Volcanism and Human Environment (in Chinese), pp. 1-13. , Beijing: Seismic Press; Liu, R., Wei, H., Tang, J., New study advances on Changbaishan-Tianchi volcano (1996) Seismological and Geomagnetic Observation and Research (in Chinese), 17 (4), p. 12; Machida, H., Moriwaki, H., Zhao, D., The recent major eruption of Changbaishan volcano and its environmental effects (1990) Geographical Reports of Tokyo Metropolitan University, 25, p. 1; Gill, J.D., McCurry, M., Large volume, mid-latitude, Cl-rich volcanic eruption during 600-1000 AD, Baitoushan, China (1992) AGU Chapman Conference on Climate, Volcanism and Global Change, , Abstract 18, March 23-27, Hilo, Hawaii; Machida, H., Arai, F., Moriwaki, H., Two tephras, Holocene markers in the sea of Japan and Japan islands (1981) Kagaku, 15, p. 269; Machida, H., Arai, F., Extensive ash falls in and around the sea of Japan from large late Quaternary eruptions (1983) J.
