Med., London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom","Global climate change is likely to have a range of consequences for human health as a result of disturbance or weakening of the biosphere's natural or human-managed life support systems. The full range of potential human health impacts of global climate change is diverse and would be distributed differentially spatially and over time. Changes in the mortality toll of heatwaves and changes in the distribution of vector-borne infectious diseases may occur early. The public health consequences of sea level rise and of regional changes in agricultural productivity may not occur (or become apparent) for several decades. Vulnerability is a measure of both sensitivity to climate change and the ability to adapt in anticipation of, or in response to, its impacts. The basic modes of adaptation to climate-induced health hazards are biological, behavioural and social. Adaptation can be undertaken at the individual, community and whole-population levels. Adaptive strategies should not introduce new health hazards. Enhancement of the acknowledged public health infrastructure and intervention programmes is essential to reduce vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change. In the longer- term, fundamental improvements in the social and material conditions of life and in the reduction of inequalities within and between populations are required for sustained reduction in vulnerability to environmental health hazards.","Adaptation; Climate change; El Nino Southern Oscillation; Primary prevention; Public health","Adaptation; Climate variability; Heatwaves; Human health impacts; Public health; Vector borne infectious diseases; Diseases; Ecology; Environmental impact; Health hazards; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; health policy; health risk; adaptation; article; global climate; health hazard; health program; heat stress; malaria; primary prevention; public health; water quality",,,,,,"Blaikie, P., Cannon, T., Wisner, B., (1994) At Risk, Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability and Disasters, , Routledge, London; Bouma, M.J., Dye, C., Cycles of malaria associated with El Niño in Venezuela (1997) Journal of the American Medical Association, 278, pp. 1772-1774; Bouma, M.J., Van Der Kaay, H.J., The El Niño Southern Oscillation and the historic malaria epidemics on the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka: An early warning system (1996) Tropical Medicine and International Health, 1, pp. 86-96; Bouma, M.J., Kovats, R.S., Goubet, S.A., Cox, J.St.H., Haines, A., Global assessment of El Niño's disaster burden (1997) Lancet, 350, pp. 1435-1438; Colwell, R.R., Global climate and infectious disease: The cholera paradigm (1996) Science, 274, pp. 2025-2031; Epstein, P.R., Biological and physical signs of climate change: Focus on mosquito-borne diseases (1998) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 78, pp. 409-417; Frisancho, R., (1991) Human Adaptation: a Functional Interpretation, , University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor; Glass, G.E., Aron, G.L., Ellis, J.H., Yoon, S.S., (1993) Applications of GIS Technology to Disease Control, , Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore; Haines, A., McMichael, A.J., Climate change and health: Implications for research, monitoring and policy (1997) British Medical Journal, 315, pp. 870-874; Hales, S., Weinstein, P., Woodward, A., Dengue fever epidemics in the South Pacific: Driven by El Niño Southern Oscillation?
