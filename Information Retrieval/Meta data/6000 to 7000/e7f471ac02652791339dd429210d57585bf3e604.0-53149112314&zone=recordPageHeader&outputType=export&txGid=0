As a part of the Stockholm County Council environmental program it was decided in 2002 that the emissions should be drastically reduced. Different ways were theoretically evaluated, and catalytic splitting to nitrogen and oxygen gas (N2 and O2) was chosen for a demonstration installation. A Japanese commercial unit for treatment of mixed anaesthetic gases (Anesclean® from Showa Denko K.K.) was thoroughly modified and installed at the Karolinska University Hospital at Huddinge in Stockholm in 2004. The destruction of N 2O was optimised and studied for 2 years. Data from both collection and destruction are given in the article. Of the collected N2O more than 95% was split to N2 and O2 in the very stable system. The overall emission decrease was mainly dependent on the share that could be collected in the specific exhaustion system as compared to the normal room ventilation. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) were used to evaluate the actual environmental value and economical cost for the process. Important factors are pointed out. © 2008 The Author(s).","Anaesthetic; Catalytic splitting; Child delivery; Decreased emission; Destruction; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas; Laughing gas; LCA; Nitrous oxide","cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental economics; global warming; greenhouse gas; hospital sector; installation; life cycle analysis; nitrous oxide; ventilation; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",,,,,,"Almemark, M., (2005) LCA of a Method to Decompose Laughing Gas, , Internal report to Stockholm County Council; Arenas-Alatorre, J., Gómez-Cortés, A., Avalos-Borja, M., Díaz, G., Surface properties of Ni-Pt/SiO2 catalyst for N2O decomposition and reduction by H2 (2005) J Phys Chem B, 109, pp. 2371-2376; Burch, R., Breen, J.P., Meunier, F.C., A review of the selective reduction of NOX with hydrocarbons under lean-burn conditions with non-zeolitic oxide and platinum group metal catalysts (2002) Appl Catalysis B: Environmental, 39, pp. 283-303. , 4; Chaki, T., Arai, T., Ebina, M., Shimokawabe, M., Catalytic reduction of N2O by C2H4 over Fe-ZSM-5: Formation and nature of carbonaceous deposits and influence of addition of O2 (2003) J Catalysis, 218, pp. 220-226. , 1; Ek, M., Tjus, K., Rahmberg, M., Brundin, S., (2005) Utvärdering Av Lustgasdestruktionen Vid Huddinge Sjukhus (Evaluation of Laughing Gas Destruction at Huddinge Hospital), , Internal report to Stockholm County Council; Kai, T., Kanmura, Y., Takahashi, S., Atobe, H., Hotta, M., Development and utilization of a system for treating waste anesthetic gases, ASA abstract (2002) Anesthesiology, 96, p. 574; Kock, E., (2005) LCC för Lustgasdestruktion (LCC for Laughing Gas Destruction), , Internal report to Stockholm County Council; Liu, Z., Amiridis, M.D., Chen, Y., Characterisation of CuO supported on tetragonal ZrO2 catalysts for N2O decomposition to N2 (2005) J Phys Chem B, 109, pp. 1251-1255; Olofsson, C., Irestedt, L., Traditional analgesic agents: Are parenteral narcotics passé and do inhalational agents still have a place in labour?
