Leaves of Artemisia tridentata, Erigeron speciosus, Festuca thurberi, Helianthella quinquinervis, Potentilla fruticosa, Potentilia gracilis and Rhodiola integrifolia were collected from plants growing in situ in control and infrared (IR)-heated (22 W m-2) plots in a meadow near the upper elevational distribution limit for A. tridentata. For six of the seven herbaceous species, RWC was not significantly different from that for A. tridentata (0.903±0:019 on control plots and 0.846±0.031 from heated plots). However, RWC was 0.644±0.04 and 0.596±0.029 for F. thurberi on control and heated plots, respectively. Water potential (ψ) varied from - 1.04 MPa for A. tridentata (control plots) to -4.83 MPa for leaves of F. thurberi (heated plots); ψ for the other species ranged from - 1.08 MPa,(R. integrifolia on control plots) to -2.62 MPa (P. gracilis on heated plots). To characterize further the responses of water relations parameters to the IR heating treatment pressure-volume isotherms were generated for A tridentata and P gracilis. Both species exhibited i effects of the IR heating treatment on saturated osmotic potential and the relative symplastic water content. Based on changes in osmotic potential and relative water content, an increase in osmotically active solutes was exhibited for leaves in collected from plants under heaters. Species-specific patterns of RWC and water potential (as well as effects on cellular water relations) may influence the ability of plant species to cope with changes in soil water content that are expected to occur with global warming for montane ecosystems in the western USA.","Artemisia tridentata (Asteraceae); Climate change; Potentilia gracilis (Rosaceae); Relative water content; Sagebrush; Water potential","Artemisia tridentata; Asteraceae; Erigeron speciosus; Festuca thurberi; Helianthella; Potentilia; Potentilla fruticosa; Potentilla gracilis; Rhodiola integrifolia; Rosaceae; Tridentata",,,,,,"Houghton, J.T., Bolin, B., (1992) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Geneva: UNEP/WMO; Peters, R.L., Conservation of biological diversity in the face of climate change (1992) Global Warming and Biological Diversity, , Peters RL, Lovejoy TE, editors.
