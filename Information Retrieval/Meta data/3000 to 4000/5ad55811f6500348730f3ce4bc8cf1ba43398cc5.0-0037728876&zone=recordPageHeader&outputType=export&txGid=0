The ACC transport through Drake Passage shows an evident strengthening along with the CO2 increase and, in the subsequent period with stabilised 3 × CO2, it keeps increasing steadily after CO2 tripling for a few centuries until a maximum (151 Sv, 17% larger than the initial state) is reached. The strengthening of the ACC transport results from the warming-induced enhancement of the meridional density gradient in the ocean interior across the ACC: it leads to a speedup of the upper layer zonal flow which outweights the deceleration in the underlying layer caused by the weakening of the deep overturning off Antarctica.",,"Atmospheric composition; Climate change; Deceleration; Global warming; Integration; Ocean currents; Stabilization; Climate models; Global warming; Ocean currents; Density gradient; Geophysical prospecting; Carbon dioxide; atmosphere-ocean coupling; circumpolar current; climate modeling; global warming; Antarctica; Antarctic circumpolar current; Antarctic Circumpolar Currents; Atmospheric CO; Coupled modeling; Density gradients; Drake passage; Initial state; Underlying layers",,,,,,"Bi, D., (2001) Transient and Long-Term Behavior of the World Ocean Under Global Warming, , PhD Thesis, 283 pp., University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia; Bi, D., Budd, W.F., Hirst, A.C., Wu, X., Collapse and reorganisation of the Southern Ocean overturning under global warming in a coupled model (2001) Geophys.
