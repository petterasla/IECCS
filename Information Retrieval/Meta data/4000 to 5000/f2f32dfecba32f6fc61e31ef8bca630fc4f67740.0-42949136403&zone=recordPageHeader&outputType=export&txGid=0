To solve this problem, the molten metal should be protected from oxidation by blanketing the surface with flux or protective gases. SF6 gas is widely used for Mg alloys as a cover gas and has proved to be a successful inhibitor. However, the use of SF6 gas is limited because of its high cost and its significant impact on non-global warming potential. Therefore, SF6 gas is being replaced by alternative protection gases. Recent studies show that there has been another attempt by adding CaO into Mg alloys. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CaO on the minimum amount of protective gas, which is necessary not to make ignition in the molten AZ31 and AZ91 Mg alloys. © 2006 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.","AZ31; AZ91; CaO; clean production; ignition resistance","Automotive industry; Calcium compounds; Casting; Electronics industry; Global warming; Ignition; Liquid metals; Blanketing; Castability; Non-global warming potential; Magnesium alloys",,,,,,"Polmear, I.J., Magnesium alloys and application (1994) Mater.
