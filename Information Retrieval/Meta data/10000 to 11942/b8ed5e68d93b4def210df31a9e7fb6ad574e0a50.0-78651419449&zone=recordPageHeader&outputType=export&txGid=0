This increase has a variety of implications for human societies, and for ecological systems. One of the most obvious ways ecosystems are affected by global climate change is through alteration of organisms' developmental timing (phenology). We used annual botanical surveys that documented the first flowering for an array of species from 1976 to 2003 to examine the potential implications of climate change for plant development. The overall trend for these species was a progressively earlier flowering time. The two earliest flowering taxa (Galanthus and Crocus) also exhibited the strongest shift in first flowering. We detected a significant trend in climate suggesting higher temperatures in winter and spring over the sampling interval and found a significant relationship between warming temperatures and first flowering time for some species. Although 60% of the species in our study flowered earlier over the sampling interval, the remaining species exhibited no statistically detectable change. This variation in response is ostensibly associated with among-species variation in the role of climate cues in plant development. Future work is needed to isolate specific climate cues, and to link plant phenology to the physiological processes that trigger plant development. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; First flowering; Global warming; Minimum temperature","biological survey; climate effect; flowering; global warming; herb; monocotyledon; phenology; physiological response; sampling; surface temperature; temperature effect; Ohio; United States; Crocus; Galanthus",,,,,,"Abu-Asab, M.S., Peterson, P.M., Shetler, S.G., Orli, S.S., Earlier plant flowering in spring as a response to global warming in the Washington, DC, area (2001) Biodivers Conserv, 10, pp. 597-612; Climate Change 2001: The scientific basis (2001) Contribution of working group I to the third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Houghton JT et al (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bradley, N.L., Leopold, A.C., Ross, J., Huffaker, W., Phenological changes reflect climate change in Wisconsin (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 9701-9704; Chapin, F.S., Randerson, J.T., McGuire, A.D., Foley, J.A., Field, C.B., Changing feedbacks in the climate-biosphere system (2008) Front Ecol Environ, 6, pp. 313-320; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Houle, G., Spring-flowering herbaceous plant species of the deciduous forests of eastern Canada and 20th century climate warming (2007) Can J For Res, 37, pp. 505-512; Iverson, L.R., Prasad, A., Predicting abundance of 80 tree species following climate change in the eastern United States (1998) Ecol Monogr, 68, pp. 465-485; Menzel, A., European phenological response to climate change matches the warming pattern (2006) Global Change Biol, 12, pp. 1969-1976; Muller, R.N., The phenology, growth and ecosystem dynamics of Erythronium americanum in the northern hardwood forest (1978) Ecol Monogr, 48, pp. 1-20; Nordli, Ø., Wielgolaski, F.E., Bakken, A.K., Hjeltnes, S.H., Måge, F., Sivle, A., Skre, O., Regional trends for bud burst and flowering of woody plants in Norway as related to climate change (2008) Int J Biometeorol, 52, pp. 625-639; Orlandi, F., Ruga, L., Romano, B., Fornaciari, M., Olive flowering as an indicator of local climatic changes (2005) Theor Appl Climatol, 81, pp. 169-176; Parmesan, C., Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change (2006) Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst, 37, pp. 637-669; Parmesan, C., Yohe, G., A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 37-42; Climate change 2007: impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (2007) Contribution of working group II to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Parry ML, Canziani OF, Palutikof JP, van der Linden PJ, Hanson CE (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Primack, D., Imbres, C., Primack, R.B., Miller-Rushing, A.J., Tredici, P.D., Herbarium specimens demonstrate earlier flowering times in response to warming in Boston (2004) Am J Bot, 91, pp. 1260-1264; Climate change 2007: the physical science basis (2007) Contribution of working group I to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change, , Solomon S, Qin D, Manning M, Chen Z, Marquis M, Averyt KB, Tignor M, Miller HL (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Walther, G.R., Post, E., Convey, P., Menzel, A., Parmesan, C., Beebee, T.J.C., Fromentin, J.M., Bairlein, F., Ecological responses to recent climate change (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 389-395; Woodall, C.W., Oswalt, C.M., Westfall, J.A., Perry, C.H., Nelson, M.D., Finley, A.O., An indicator of tree migration in forests of the eastern United States (2009) For Ecol Manag, 257, pp. 1434-1444","McEwan, R.
