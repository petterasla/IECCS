Nowhere will these challenges be greater than in the developing world where often weak institutions and governance systems struggle to deal with mounting pressures from population growth, inadequate infrastructure, and diminishing or already depleted natural resources. This article synthesizes the many global climate change and other anthropogenic threats to coastal ecosystems and draws on lessons and good practices from global experience in integrated coastal management (ICM) that can be transferred to coastal adaptation to these challenges. The case is made that the process and best practices of ICM are not radically changed by applying a climate lens. For the most part, the good practices of planning and implementation coastal management measures apply equally to climate change as they do to other coastal issues. However, there are some new and important considerations that enter into planning and decision-making with respect to climate change. These considerations include the need for an even greater emphasis on nature-based coastal protection strategies and measures, more pronounced issues of uncertainty in decision-making, the need for a longer planning horizon, and the importance of including in the decision-making equation opportunities to mitigate the sources of climate change with adaptation measures. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate change; Coastal adaptation; Coastal impacts; ICM; Lessons learned","Best practice; Coastal adaptation; Coastal ecosystems; Coastal issues; Coastal management; Coastal protection; Developing world; Global climate changes; Good practices; Governance systems; Integrated coastal management; Lessons learned; Planning horizons; Population growth; Decision making; Developing countries; Planning; Shore protection; Climate change; adaptation; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; coastal protection; coastal zone management; decision making; developing world",,,,,,"Burkett, V., Megadeltas and climate change (2008) Basins and Coasts, 2 (1), pp. 16-19. , http://www.imcafs.org/coastsheds/issues/article2.1.5.pdf, Available at; Dasgupta, S., Laplante, B., Meisner, C., Wheeler, D., Yan, J., (2007) The Impact of Sea Level Rise On Developing Countries: A Comparative Analysis, p. 51. , World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 4136, World Bank, Washington, D.C; The Contributions of Science to Integrated Coastal Management (1996) GESAMP Reports and Studies, 61, p. 66. , GESAMP (IMO/FAO/UNESCO-IOC/WMO/WHO/IAEA/UN/UNEP Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection; (2007) Climate Change Impacts, AdaptaTion and Vulnerability, pp. 315-356. , http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg2.htm, IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)., Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Chapter 6: Coastal Systems and Loy-Lying Areas, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, Available at; (2007) Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Contribution of Working Group II to The Fourth Assessment Report of The Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change, pp. 717-743. , http://www.ipcc.ch/, IPCC., Chapter 17: Assessment of Adaptation Practices, Options, Constraints and Capacity, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, Available at; (2007) The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to The Fourth Assessment Report of The Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change, , http://www.ipcc.ch/, IPCC., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.
