Growth and survival were analysed in response to climatic transfer distance, the difference in mean annual temperature (MAT) between the site and the population origin. Differences among populations at each site, and across sites for regional groups of populations, were related to climate transfer distance, but in opposite ways in the northern vs. southern parts of the species range. Climate transfers equivalent to warming by 1-4 °C markedly increased the survival of populations in northern Europe (≥ 62°N, < 2 °C MAT) and modestly increased height growth ≥ 57°N but decreased survival at < 62°N and modestly decreased height growth at < 54°N latitude in Europe. Thus, even modest climate warming will likely influence Scots pine survival and growth, but in distinct ways in different parts of the species range. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Climate-change impacts; Genetic variation; Global warming; Growth; Intraspecific differentiation; Pinus sylvestris; Population adaptation; Provenance; Survival","climate change; climate effect; coniferous tree; geographical variation; global warming; growth response; home range; survival; article; biological model; climate; comparative study; Europe; geography; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; North America; pine; temperature; Climate; Europe; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Biological; North America; Pinus; Temperature; Eurasia; Europe; North America; Pinus sylvestris",,,,,,"Barber, V.A., Juday, G.P., Finney, B.P., Reduced growth of Alaskan white spruce in the twentieth century from temperature-induced drought stress (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 668-673; Briffa, K.R., Schweingruber, F.H., Jones, P.D., Osborn, T.J., Harris, I.C., Shiyatov, S.G., Trees tell of past climates: But are they speaking less clearly today?
