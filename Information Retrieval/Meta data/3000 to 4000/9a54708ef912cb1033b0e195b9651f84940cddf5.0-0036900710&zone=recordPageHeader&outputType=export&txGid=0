In the first (day warming only) experiment, rates of night-time leaf dark respiration (Rdark) remained constant and leaves displayed a modest increase (11%) in light-saturated photosynthetic capacity (Amax) during the day (1000-1300 h) over the 6 °C range. In the second (dual night and day warming) experiment, Rdark increased by 77% when nocturnal temperatures were increased from 15 °C (0.36 μmol m-2 s-1) to 25 °C (0.64 μmol m-2 s-1). Amax responded positively to the additional nocturnal warming, and increased by 38 and 64% in the 20/28 and 25/31 °C treatments, respectively, compared with the 15/25 °C treatment. These increases in photosynthetic capacity were associated with strong increases in the maximum carboxylation rate of rubisco (Vcmax) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration capacity mediated by maximum electron transport rate (Jmax). Leaf soluble sugar and starch concentration, measured at sunrise, declined significantly as nocturnal temperature increased. The nocturnal temperature manipulation resulted in a significant inverse relationship between Amax and pre-dawn leaf carbohydrate status. Independent measurements of the temperature response of photosynthesis indicated that the optimum temperature (Topt) acclimated fully to the 6 °C range of temperature imposed in the daytime warming. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated night-time temperature increases photosynthetic capacity during the following light period through a respiratory-driven reduction in leaf carbohydrate concentration. These responses indicate that predicted increases in night-time minimum temperatures may have a significant influence on net plant carbon uptake.","Carbohydrate content; Global warming; Net carbon exchange; Photosynthesis","carbon cycle; carbon fixation; global warming; photosynthesis; respiration; Populus; Populus deltoides",,,,,,"Alward, R.D., Detling, J.K., Milchunas, D.G., Grassland vegetation changes and nocturnal global warming (1999) Science, 283, pp. 229-231; Amthor, J.S., The role of maintenance respiration in plant growth (1984) Plant, Cell and Environment, 8, pp. 561-569; Amthor, J.S., (1989) Respiration and Crop Productivity, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Amthor, J.S., Direct effect of elevated CO2 on nocturnal in situ leaf respiration in nine temperate deciduous tree species is small (2000) Tree Physiology, 20, pp. 139-144; Atkin, O.K., Holly, C., Ball, M.C., Acclimation of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) leaf respiration to seasonal and diurnal variations in temperature: The importance of changes in the capacity and temperature sensitivity of respiration (2000) Plant, Cell and Environment, 23, pp. 15-26; Azcon-Bieto, J., Relationships between photosynthesis and respiration in the dark in plants (1992) Trends in Photosynthesis Research, pp. 241-253. , ed.
