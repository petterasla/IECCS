Rapidly emerging fuel-cell-based technologies could be developed for future replacement of onboard electrical systems in larger more-electric or all-electric aircraft. The Environmentally Friendly Inter City Aircraft Powered by Fuel Cells project, led by Politecnico di Torino in the Sixth Framework Programme, has carried out a feasibility study on all-electric intercity aircraft to provide a preliminary definition of new forms of aircraft systems that can be obtained by fuel cell technologies. Solid oxide fuel cell systems could be advantageous for some aeronautical applications, due to their capability of accepting hydrocarbons fuels with lower pollutant effects (e.g., natural gas), especially sustainable biofuels such as secondgeneration bioethanol. In this paper, the design of a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell and micro gas turbine energy system, as well as the simulation of complete missions of a regional jet, has been performed. The system will be discussed in two fuel configurations, natural gas and bioethanol, and the difference in the system structure and regulation will be discussed. Preliminary estimations on size and weight of these new systems have been carried out. The obtained results are discussed. © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.
