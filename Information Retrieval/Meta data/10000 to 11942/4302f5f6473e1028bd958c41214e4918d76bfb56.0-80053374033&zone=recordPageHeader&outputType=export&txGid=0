The key to both is a substantial increase of Soil Organic Matter (SOM); increasing levels worldwide by one-third would deplete atmospheric CO2 levels to near zero. Sugarcane growers can play their part through embracing trash mulching and minimum tillage; but additional field experiments are needed to define best techniques. Increased SOM will improve yields and water-use efficiencies, and reduce erosion. The ultimate development of increasing SOM and, thus, fertility is the burying of biochar, a technology that has been demonstrated (the terra preta soils) in Amazonia for over a millennium. The sugar industry is exceptionally well placed to promote the use of biochar - albeit on a scale which would probably be limited to ""garden"" type food crops - as it has the required expertise and ""extension"" staff, and the raw materials (waste cellulosic material and nutrients such as filter mud and molasses). The use of sugarcane as a biofuel seems to be successful in Brazil, but that technology is not necessarily appropriate to different socio-economic environments. Small scale charcoal producing plants, based on cane trash or bagasse, could have a major economic impact in poorer countries, and would help to prevent deforestation. Again, the sugar industry has the expertise and resources to promote such technology.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Sugarcane",,,,,,,"Robinson, A.B., Robinson, N.E., Soon, W., (2008) Petition Project: Environmental Effects of Increased CO2, , Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine; Carbon sequestration in dryland soils (2004) World Resources Reports, 102. , FAO; Nye, P.H., Soil forming processes in the humid tropics (1955) J.
