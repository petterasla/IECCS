Trade publications report that currently available technology is rated near 60% thermal efficiency. Research and development efforts are in place targeting even higher efficiencies in the next two decades. In the face of diminishing natural resources and increasing carbon dioxide emissions, leading to greenhouse gas effect and global warming, these efforts are even more critical today than in the last century. The main performance driver in a combined cycle power plant is the gas turbine. The basic thermodynamics of the gas turbine, described by the well-known Brayton cycle, dictates that the key design parameters that determine the gas turbine performance are the cycle pressure ratio and maximum cycle temperature at the turbine inlet. While performance calculations for an ideal gas turbine are straightforward with compact mathematical formulations, detailed engineering analysis of real machines with turbine hot gas path cooling requires complex models. Such models, requisite for detailed engineering design work, involve highly empirical heat transfer formulations embedded in a complex system of equations that are amenable only to numerical solutions. A cooled turbine modeling system incorporating all pertinent physical phenomena into compact formulations is developed and presented in this paper. The model is fully physics-based and amenable to simple spreadsheet calculations while illustrating the basic principles with sufficient accuracy and extreme qualitative rigor. This model is valuable not only as a teaching and training tool, it is also suitable to preliminary gas turbine combined cycle design calculations in narrowing down the field of feasible design options.",,"Basic principles; Carbon dioxide emissions; Compact formulations; Complex model; Complex systems; Cycle pressure ratios; Design calculations; Engineering analysis; Engineering design; Feasible design; Gas turbine combined cycle; Gas turbine performance; Higher efficiency; Hot-gas path; Key design parameters; Mathematical formulation; Modeling systems; Numerical solution; Parametric models; Performance calculation; Performance drivers; Physical phenomena; Physics-based; Research and development; Thermal efficiency; Training tools; Turbine inlets; Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Design; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Gas turbines; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Large scale systems; Mathematical models; Models; Thermodynamics; Turbomachinery; Gas emissions",,,,,,"Moran, M.J., Shapiro, H.N., (1988) Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics, , Wiley, New York; Cohen, H., Rogers, G.F.C., Saravanamuttoo, H.I.H., (1991) Gas Turbine Theory, , 3rd ed., Longman Scientific and Technical, Essex, England; Lakshminarayana, B., (1996) Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer of Turbomachinery, , Wiley, New York; Dunn, M.G., Convective heat transfer and aerodynamics in axial flow turbines (2001) ASME J.
