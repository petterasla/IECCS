To gain an understanding of how such increased soil C inputs would affect C cycling in the vast grasslands of northern China, we conducted a field experiment in which the responses of plant and microbial biomass and respiration were studied. • Our experiment included the below-ground addition of particulate organic matter (POM) at rates equivalent to 0, 60, 120 and 240 g C m-2, under either natural precipitation or under enhanced precipitation during the summer period (as predicted for that region in recent simulations using general circulation models). • We observed that addition of POM had a large effect on soil microbial biomass and activity and that a major part of the added C was rapidly lost from the system. This suggests that microbial activity in the vast temperate grassland ecosystems of northern China is energy-limited. Moreover, POM addition (and the associated nutrient release) affected plant growth much more than the additional water input. • Although we performed no direct fertilization experiments, the response of plant productivity to POM addition (and associated release of nutrients) leads us to believe that plant productivity in the semiarid grassland ecosystems of northern China is primarily limited by nutrients and not by water. © The Authors (2007).","Below-ground processes; China; Global climate change; Grassland ecosystem; Microbial carbon; Precipitation; Soil respiration; Typical steppe","carbon; water; belowground biomass; carbon cycle; climate change; experimental study; global climate; irrigation; microbial community; net primary production; particulate organic matter; precipitation (climatology); semiarid region; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil respiration; steppe; temperate environment; altitude; article; chemistry; China; climate; desert climate; ecosystem; kinetics; physiology; Poaceae; soil; temperature; Altitude; Carbon; China; Climate; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Kinetics; Poaceae; Soil; Temperature; Water; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Arnone Iii., J.A., Körner, C., Soil and biomass carbon pools in model communities of tropical plants under elevated CO2 (1995) Oecologia, 104, pp. 61-71; Bahn, M., Knapp, M., Garajova, Z., Pfahringer, N., Cernusca, A., Root respiration in temperate mountain grasslands differing in land use (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 995-1006; Blume, E., Bischoff, M., Reichert, J.M., Moorman, T., Konopka, A., Turco, R.F., Surface and subsurface microbial biomass, community structure and metabolic activity as a function of soil depth and season (2002) Applied Soil Ecology, 20, pp. 171-181; Boone, R.D., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Canary, J.D., Kaye, J.P., Roots exert a strong influence on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (1998) Nature, 396, pp. 570-572; Boxman, A.W., Blanck, K., Brandrud, T.E., Emmett, B.A., Gundersen, P., Hogervorst, R.F., Kjonaas, O.J., Timmermann, V., Vegetation and soil biota response to experimentally-changed nitrogen inputs in coniferous forest ecosystems of the NITREX project (1998) Forest Ecology and Management, 101, pp. 65-79; Buchmann, N., Biotic and abiotic factors controlling soil respiration rates in Picea abies stands (2000) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 32, pp. 1625-1635; Burton, A.J., Pregitzer, K.S., Hendrick, R.L., Relationships between fine root dynamics and nitrogen availability in Michigan northern hardwood forests (2000) Oecologia, 125, pp. 389-399; Campbell, C.A., Lafond, G.P., Zentner, R.P., Biederbeck, V.O., Influence of fertilizer and straw baling on soil organic matter in a thick black chernozem in western Canada (1991) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 23, pp. 443-446; Campbell, J.L., Sun, O.J., Law, B.E., Supply-side controls on soil respiration among Oregon forests (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 1857-1869; Chen, H., Tian, H.Q., Does a general temperature-dependent Q10 model of soil respiration exist at biome and global scale?
