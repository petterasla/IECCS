How temperature influences microbial decomposers is unclear. We measured in vitro rates of decomposition of senesced sedge leaves and rhizomes (Carex aquatilis), from a fen, and peat moss (Sphagnum fuscum), from a bog, at 14 and 20 °C by the three most frequently isolated fungi and bacteria from these materials. Decomposition rates of the bog litter decreased (5- to 17-fold) with elevated temperatures, and decomposition of the sedge litters was either enhanced (2- to 30-fold) or remained unaffected by elevated temperatures. The increased temperature regime always favoured fungal over bacterial decomposition rates (2- to 3-fold). Different physiological characteristics of these microbes suggest that fungi using polyphenolic polymers as a carbon source cause greater mass losses of these litters. Litter quality exerted a stronger influence on decomposition at elevated temperatures, as litter rich in nutrients decomposed more quickly than litter poorer in nutrients at higher temperatures (8.0%-25.7% for the sedge litters vs. 0.2% for the bryophyte litter). We conclude that not all peatlands may provide a positive feedback to global warming. Cautious extrapolation of our data to the ecosystem level suggests that decomposition rates in fens may increase and those in bogs may decrease under a global warming scenario. © 2004 NRC Canada.","Bacteria; Carex aquatilis; Climate change; Decomposition; Fungi; Microcosms; Peatlands; Sphagnum fuscum; Temperature","Bacteria; Decomposition; Ecosystems; Fungi; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Organic polymers; Thermal effects; Decomposition rate; Microbial decomposers; Microbial species; Polyphenolic polymers; Microbiology; carbon; polyphenol; decomposition; global warming; greenhouse gas; litter; microorganism; peatland; article; bacterium; Carex aquatilis; controlled study; decomposition; fungus; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; in vitro study; microcosm; nonhuman; peatland; positive feedback; priority journal; rhizome; Sphagnum; sphagnum fuscum; temperature; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Ecosystem; Environmental Microbiology; Fluorides, Topical; Fungi; Greenhouse Effect; Plant Leaves; Sphagnopsida; Temperature; Carex aquatilis; Sphagnum fuscum",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; polyphenol, 37331-26-3; Carex; Fluorides, Topical",,,,"Aerts, R., De Caluwe, H., Nutritional and plant-mediated controls on leaf litter decomposition of Carex species (1997) Ecol., 78, pp. 244-260; Alexopoulos, C.J., Mims, C.W., Blackwell, M., (1996) Introductory Mycology. 4th Ed., , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Bardgett, R.D., Kandeler, E., Tscherko, D., Hobbs, P.J., Bezemer, T.M., Jones, T.H., Thompson, L.J., Below-ground microbial community development in a high temperature world (1999) Oikos, 85, pp. 193-203; Bartsch, I., Moore, T.R., A preliminary investigation of primary production and decomposition in four peatlands near Schefferville, Quebec (1985) Can.
