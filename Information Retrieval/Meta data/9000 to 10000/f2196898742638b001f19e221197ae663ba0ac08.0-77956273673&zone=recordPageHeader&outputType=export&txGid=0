This study quantitatively examines the linkages among variations in climate, agricultural yields, and people's migration responses by using an instrumental variables approach. Our method allows us to identify the relationship between crop yields and migration without explicitly controlling for all other confounding factors. Using state-level data from Mexico, we find a significant effect of climate-driven changes in crop yields on the rate ofemigration to the United States. The estimated semielasticity of emigration with respect to crop yields is approximately -0.2, i.e., a 10% reduction in crop yields would lead an additional 2% of the population to emigrate. We then use the estimated semielasticity to explore the potential magnitude of future emigration. Depending on the warming scenarios used and adaptation levels assumed, with other factors held constant, by approximately the year 2080, climate change is estimated to induce 1.4 to 6.7 million adult Mexicans (or 2% to 10% of the current population aged 15-65 y) to emigrate as a result of declines in agricultural productivity alone. Although the results cannot be mechanically extrapolated to other areas and time periods, our findings are significant from a global perspective given that many regions, especially developing countries, are expected to experience significant declines in agricultural yields as a result of projected warming.","Agricultural productivity; Environmental migrants; Global warming; Human migration; Instrumental variables approach","article; climate change; forecasting; harvest; human; Mexico; migration; priority journal; United States; adult; agriculture; crop; epidemiology; growth, development and aging; statistics; Adult; Agriculture; Causality; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Emigration and Immigration; Forecasting; Humans; Mexico; United States; Young Adult",,,,,,"(2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Ayres, R., Walter, J., The greenhouse effect: Damages, costs and abatement (1991) Environ Resour Econ, 1, pp. 237-270; Martin, P., Lefebvre, M., Malaria and Climate - Sensitivity of malaria potential transmission to climate (1995) Ambio, 24, pp. 200-207; Myers, N., Kent, J., (1994) Environmental Exodus: An Emergent Crisis in the Global Arena, , Climate Institute, Washington, DC; McLeman, R., Smit, B., Migration as an adaptation to climate change (2006) Clim Change, 76, pp. 31-53; Stern, N., (2007) The Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change, , Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge; Warner, K., (2009) In Search of Shelter: Mapping the Effects of Climate Change on Human Migration and Displacement, , United Nations University, CARE, and CIESIN-Columbia University and in close collaboration with the European Commission ""Environmental Change and Forced Migration Scenarios Project"", the UNHCR, and the World Bank, Bonn, Germany; Myers, N., Environmental refugees: A growing phenomenon of the 21st century (2002) Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 357, pp. 609-613; (2008) World Development Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography, , World Bank Group The World Bank Group, Washington, DC; De Haas, H., (2009) Mobility and Human Development, , United Nations Development Programme, Washington, DC; Stark, O., Levhari, D., On migration and risk in LDCs (1982) Econ Dev Cult Change, 31, pp. 191-196; De Sherbinin, A., Vanwey, L.K., McSweeney, K., Aggarwal, R., Barbieri, A., Henry, S., Hunter, L.M., Walker, R., Rural household demographics, livelihoods and the environment (2008) Global Environmental Change, 18 (1), pp. 38-53. , DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2007.05.005, PII S0959378007000398; Gleditsch, N.P., Nordas, R., Salehyan, I., (2007) Climate Change and Conflict: The Migration Link, , International Peace Academy, New York; Leighton, M., (2009) Migration, Environment, and Climate Change: Assessing the Evidence, pp. 319-351. , eds Laczko F, Aghazarm C International Organization for Migration, Geneva, Switzerland; Alscher, S., Faist, S.T., (2009) Environmental Factors in Mexican Migration: The Cases of Chiapas and Tlaxcala, , UN University, New York; Döös, B.R., Can large-scale environmental migrations be predicted?
