Therefore a questionnaire inquiry oriented to the perception of the climate change impact and current state of adaptation strategies implementation was carried out and evaluated. The research was realised among the water management experts in six large transboundary basins: Elbe, Rhine, Guadiana, Amudaria, Orange and Nile. The questionnaire was divided into six parts concerning for example: expected climate change impacts, adaptation measures, drivers for development of adaptation strategy, adaptation barriers etc. Responses were evaluated with rating and the dominant answers and lists of priority were established. Results were evaluated looking for overall conclusions in all or almost all regions, as well as conclusions for each region. The main benefit of the research lies in the evaluation based principally on the opinions of policy makers, stakeholders and water managers in the river basins not on the climate scenarios. The outcomes have proved understanding of the climate change impact issue over all six basins, only the approach to adaptation is partly different. The historical development of water management in the basin influences the perception as well.","Adaptation strategy; Climate change; Questionnaire inquiry; Water management",,,,,,,"Hattermann, F.F., Post, J., Krysanova, V., Conradt, T., Wechsung, F., Assessment of water availability in a Central-European River Basin (Elbe) under climate change (2008) Advances in Climate Change Research, , Article ID: 1673-1719 (2008) Suppl.-0042-09; Krysanova, V., Hattermann, F., Habeck, A., Expected changes in water resources availability and water quality with respect to climate change in the Elbe River basin (2005) Nordic Hydrology, 36 (4-5), pp. 321-333. , (Germany); Krysanova, V., Practices and lessons learned in coping with climatic hazards at the river-basin scale: Floods and droughts (2008) Ecology and Society, 13 (2), p. 32; Krysanova, V., (2009) NeWater Synthesis Product 6: Cross-comparison of Climate Change Adaptation Strategies Across Regions, , http://www.newater.info/index.php?pid=1049; Krysanova, V., (2009) Cross-Comparison of Climate Change Adaptation Strategies Across Large River Basins in Europe, , Africa and Asia.
