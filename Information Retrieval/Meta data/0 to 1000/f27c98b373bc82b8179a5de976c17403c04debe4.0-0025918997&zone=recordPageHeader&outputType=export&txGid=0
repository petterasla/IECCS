Increases in concentrations of CO2 and CH4 enhance the 'greenhouse effect' of the atmosphere and may contribute to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns at the earth's surface. Nitrogen oxides and SO2 are phytotoxic and also react with other pollutants to produce other phytotoxins in the troposphere such as O3 and acidic substances. However, release of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere may cause depletion of stratospheric O3, increasing the transmittance of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation to the earth's surface. Increased intensities of UV-B could affect plants and enhance photochemical reactions that generate some phytotoxic pollutants. The role of mycorrhizae in plant responses to such stresses has received little attention. Although plans for several research programs have acknowledged the importance of drought tolerance and soil fertility in plant responses to atmospheric stresses, mycorrhizae are rarely targeted to receive specific investigation. Most vascular land plants form mycorrhizae, so the role of mycorrhizae in mediating plant responses to atmospheric change may be an important consideration in predicting effects of atmospheric changes on plants in managed and natural ecosystems. © 1991.",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; methane; mycorrhiza; ozone; sulphur dioxide; Embryophyta; Mycorrhizae; Fungi; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; methane; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; plant toxin; sulfur dioxide; agriculture; air quality; atmosphere; climate; conference paper; ecosystem; environmental management; environmental temperature; forest; fungus; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; plant; pollutant; precipitation; research; temperature; ultraviolet b radiation",,,,,,"Adams, Global climate change and US agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 214-219; Anderson, Rygiewicz, Stress interactions and mycorrhizal plant response: Understanding carbon allocation priorities (1991) Environ.
