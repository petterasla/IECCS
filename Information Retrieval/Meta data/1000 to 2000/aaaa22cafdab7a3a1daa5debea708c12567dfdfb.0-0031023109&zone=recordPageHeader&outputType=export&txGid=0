In this article it is shown that cascading of the renewable resource pinewood can lead to large savings in primary resource use. For pinewood a cascade of five or six steps can be set up which extends the time that the resource is in use from about 75 to more than 350 years. Cascading also means that, when using wood, the moment that carbon dioxide is emitted, is postponed. This is interesting in relation to global warming. In the Netherlands, a country where labour is relatively expensive, parts of this cascade are realised in practice. Until now, however only a small percentage of the total amount of wood is cascaded. To favour cascading of wood several options may be considered, such as eco-taxation of resources, prohibition to dump waste-wood and a 'wood-bank' showing which kind of wood with certain properties is available at a certain moment.",,"Cascading; Pine wood; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Renewable energy resources; Waste disposal; Wood wastes; Wood; article; environment; recycling; responsibility; waste management; wood",,,,,,"Fraanje, P.J., Lafleur, M.C.C., Verantwoord gebruik van hout in Nederland (1994) IVAM Environmental Research, 94 (8). , University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam; Lafleur, M.C.C., Fraanje, P.J., Bos- en houtbeleid in Nederland (1995) IVAM Environmental Research, 95 (5). , University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam; Meadows, D., (1972) Grenzen Aan de Groei, , Het Spektrum, Utrecht; (1989) Nationaal Milieubeleidsplan, , TK 1988-1989, 21137, nrs. 1-2, Den Haag; (1990) Nationaal Milieubeleidsplan Plus, , bijlage 2 Duurzaam Bouwen,.TK 1989-1990, 21137, nrs. 23, Den Haag; Reijnders, L., Expanding producer responsibility for reducing environmental impact (1993) TMA, 3, pp. 69-72; Reijnders, L., (1995) Environmentally Improved Products and Production, , Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1995; Sienknecht, K., Fraanje, P.J., (1992) Bouwen Met Riet, , WIE; Gouda; Sirkin, T., Ten Houten, M., Resource cascading and the cascade chain (1993) IVAM ., 71. , University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam; Sirkin, T., Ten Houten, M., The cascade chain (1994) Res.
