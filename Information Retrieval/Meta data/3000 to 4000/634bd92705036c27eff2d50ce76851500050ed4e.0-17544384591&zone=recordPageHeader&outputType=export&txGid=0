Since long PSA has integrated vegetable oil derivatives/biofuels in its activities to reach its global objectives of innovation and growth. In France many vehicle fleets have been running with a blend of normal automotive diesel and biodiesel (30%) for over ten years: none of these has encountered any problem related to the fuel. As a car manufacturer PSA is in favor of biofuels when used in blending with conventional petroleum fuels, gasoline and diesel - an approach that has several advantages: • A favorable well-to-wheel CO2 balance (as when growing the plant absorbs some CO2), which contributes to limit global warming. • A complementary source of motor fuel to help reduce crude oil (and diesel) imports. • A way to support the agricultural sector (by providing a new outlet for their crops, see set-aside lands). Produced from cereals (corn, maize...) or sugar beet, or from vegetable oil plants like rapeseed, sunflower, or soyabean, biofuels are intrinsically renewable energies. Apart from their particularly favorable well-to-wheel balance, which helps fight against global warming, these fuels allow to reduce exhaust emissions from motor vehicles, notably particulates when using methyl esters derived from vegetable oils.","Global warming and greenhouse gases; Opportunity for fuel blending; Quality and norms; Renewable energies; Well-to-wheel analysis","Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Helianthus; Sinapis arvensis; Zea mays",,,,,,,"Maurer, B.; Énergie et Environnement, PSA/DOGN/CGMP/CED PSA Peugeot C., Internal Mail Box 84, 18, rue des Fauvelles, 92250 la Garenne-Colombes, France; email: beatrice.maurer@mpsa.com",,,,,,,,12588210,,,,"French","OCL Ol.
