The LCA method is also used to obtain a quantitative estimation of the environmental impact of discharges during the entire life cycle of the GLUWP. Various emergy-based indices, such as emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental load ratio (ELR), emergy sustainability index (ESI), net economic benefit (Np), and environmental impacts of process-based LCA, including global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication (EU), nonrenewable resource depletion (RU), energy consumption (EN), acidification potential (AP), photochemical oxidant creation potential (POCP), particulate matter (PM) and wastes (W), are calculated. The results show that the GLUWP has higher proportions of renewable resource input, less pressure on the environment, more environmental support and better ecological and economic benefits, which can be considered as an environment-friendly and long-term sustainable ecological practice, compared with another constructed wetland in Beijing. Meanwhile, the dominant environmental impact is induced by POCP with the construction phase contributing the most on the entire life cycle. It is expected that increasing green area, extensively using environment-friendly materials, optimizing construction techniques and reducing power consumption can promote the sustainability of the GLUWP. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Emergy; Life cycle assessment; Urban wetland park","Constructed wetlands; Construction phase; Construction technique; Economic benefits; Ecosystem services; Emergy; Emergy yield ratio; Energy consumption; Environment friendly; Environment-friendly materials; Environmental loads; Global warming potential; Green areas; LCA methods; Life cycle assessment; Life-cycle assessments; Non-renewable resource; Organic matter; Particulate Matter; Photochemical oxidants; Quantitative estimation; Reducing power; Renewable resource; Sustainability index; Typical urban; Urban wetland park; Ecosystems; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Eutrophication; Forestry; Global warming; Parks; Rating; Sustainable development; Wetlands; Environmental impact; acidification; constructed wetland; economic impact; ecosystem service; emergy; energy use; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; global warming; greenspace; life cycle analysis; photochemistry; quantitative analysis; sustainability; sustainable development; urban area; wetland; Beijing [China]; China",,,,,,"Brown, M.T., Arding, J.E., (1991) Tranformities Working Paper, , Center for Wetlands, Environmental Engineering Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; Brown, M.T., Ulgiati, S., Emergy-based indices and ratios to evaluate sustainability: monitoring economies and technology toward environmentally sound innovation (1997) Ecological Engineering, 9, pp. 51-69; Björklund, J., Geber, U., Rydberg, T., Emergy analysis of municipal wastewater treatment and generation of electricity by digestion of sewage sludge (2001) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 31, pp. 293-316; Brown, M.T., Bardi, E., Folio #3: emergy of global processes (2001) Handbook of Emergy Evaluation: A Compendium of Data for Emergy Computation Issued in a Series of Folios, , Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; Brown, M.T., Ulgiati, S., Emergy evaluations and environmental loading of electricity production systems (2002) Journal of Cleaner Production, 10, pp. 321-334; Brown, M.T., Buranakarn, V., Emergy indices and ratios for sustainable material cycles and recycle options (2003) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 38, pp. 1-22; Brown, M.T., Ulgiati, S., Emergy, transformity and ecosystem health (2004) Handbook of Ecological Indicators for Assessment of Ecosystem Health, , Elsevier, New York, S.E.
