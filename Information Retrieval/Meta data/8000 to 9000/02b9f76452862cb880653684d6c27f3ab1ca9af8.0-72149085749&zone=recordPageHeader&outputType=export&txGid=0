Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions are one of the key attributable variables in GLOBAL WARMING along with atmospheric temperature. We develop a differential equation for each of six attributable variables that constitute CO 2 emissions and a differential system of the sum of the variables. We are using real historical data on the subject phenomenon to develop the analytical form of the equations. We evaluate the quality of the developed model by utilizing a retrofitting process. Having such an analytical system we can obtain good estimates of the rate of change of CO 2 emissions, individually and cumulatively as a function of time for near and far target times. Such information is quite useful in strategic planning of the subject matter. © 2009.","Differential equation (DF); Rate of change (ROC); Short and long term prediction of rate of change; Statistical modeling","Analytical systems; Carbon dioxide emissions; Developed model; Differential systems; Function of time; Historical data; Long-term prediction; Rate of change; Statistical modeling; Subject matters; System of differential equations; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Fluorescence; Global warming; Retrofitting; Strategic planning; Differential equations",,,,,,"Blasing, T.J., Christine, B., Marland, G., State-by state carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels use in the United States 1960-2000 (2005) Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, 10, pp. 659-674; Blasing, T.J., Broniak, C.T., Marland, G., The annual cycle of fossil-fuels carbon dioxide emissions in the United States (2005) Tellus, 57 B, pp. 107-115; Blasing, T.J., Hand, K., Monthly carbon emissions from natural-gas flaring and cement manufacture in the United States (2007) Tellus, 59 B, pp. 15-21; Lashof, D., The dynamic greenhouse: Feedback processes that may influence future concentrations of atmospheric trace gases and climatic change (1989) Climatic Change, 14, pp. 213-242; Tsokos, C.P., Statistical Modeling of Global Warming (2007) The 5th International Conference on Dynamic Systems and Applications, ICDSA5, IFNA, , Atlanta, Georgia, June; Chris, P., Tsokos, G.V.P., (2008) Institute of Advanced Studies, Global Warming, , Visakhapatnam, India; Chris, P., Tsokos, G.V.P., (2008) Institute of Advanced Studies, Carbon Dioxide in the Atmosphere, , Visakhapatnam, India; Tsokos, C.P., Global Warming (2008) The 6th International Congress of IFNA, IFNA, , Orlando, Florida, July; Bunce, J.A., (2001) International Journal of Plant Sciences, 162 (6), pp. 1261-1266; Tans, P.P., Fung, I.Y., Takahashi, T., (1990) Science, New Series, 247 (4949), pp. 1431-1438; Cess, R.D., Potter, G.L., Blanchet, J.P., Boer, G.J., Ghan, S.J., Kiehl, J.T., Le Treut, H., Yagai, I., (1989) Science, New Series, 245 (4917), pp. 513-516; Goreau, T.J., Balancing atmospheric carbon dioxide.
