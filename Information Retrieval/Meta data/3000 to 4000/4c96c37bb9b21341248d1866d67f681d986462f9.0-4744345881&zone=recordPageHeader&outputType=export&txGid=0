However, few studies have actually addressed this question experimentally in the Arctic, and those that did found only little evidence for competition. Such species interactions will presumably become more important in the future, as Global Climate Change takes effect on terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated plant-plant interactions in the High Arctic, following the growth of Luzula confusa and Salix polaris in pure and mixed stands, and under elevated-temperature treatment over 2 years. To understand the mechanisms of competition, a parallel experiment was undertaken in phytotrons, manipulating competition, temperature and nutrient availability. Our findings indicate that competition is acting in the natural vegetation, and that climatic warming will alter the balance of interactions in favour of the dwarf shrub S. polaris. The phytotron experiment suggested that the mechanism is a higher responsiveness of Salix to nutrient availability, which increased under warming in the field. While Luzula showed a positive response to higher temperature in the lab, its performance in mixed stands in the field was actually reduced by warming, indicating a competitive repression of growth by Salix. The growth of Salix was also reduced by the presence of Luzula, but it was still able to profit from warming. Our findings suggest that climatic warming will result in greater shrub dominance of High Arctic tundra, but we also conjecture that grazing could reverse the situation to a graminoid-dominated tundra. These two divergent scenarios would have different implications for ecosystem feedbacks to climatic change. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Competition; Luzula confusa; Nutrient availability; Salix polaris; Warming","arctic environment; climate change; competition (ecology); nutrient availability; temperature effect; Arctic; Luzula; Luzula confusa; Salix; Salix polaris",,,,,,"Aarssen, L.W., Epp, G.A., Neighbour manipulations in natural vegetation: A review (1990) Journal of Vegetation Science, 1, pp. 13-30; Baddeley, J.A., Woodin, S.J., Alexander, I.J., Effects of increased nitrogen and phosphorus availability on the photosynthesis and nutrient relations of three arctic dwarf shrubs from Svalbard (1994) Functional Ecology, 8, pp. 676-685; Bret-Harte, M.S., Shaver, G.R., Zoerner, J.P., Developmental plasticity allows Betula nana to dominate tundra subjected to an altered environment (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 18-32; Brooker, R.W., Callaghan, T.V., The balance between positive and negative plant interactions and its relationship to environmental gradients: A model (1998) Oikos, 81, pp. 196-207; Callaway, R.M., Walker, L.R., Competition and facilitation: A synthetic approach to interactions in plant communities (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1958-1965; Carlsson, B.A., Callaghan, T.V., Positive plant interactions in tundra vegetation and the importance of shelter (1991) Journal of Ecology, 79, pp. 973-983; Chapin, F.S., Körner, C., (1995) Arctic and Alpine Biodiversity: Patterns, Causes and Ecosystem Consequences, , Springer, London; Chapin, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Individualistic growth response of tundra plant species to environmental manipulations in the field (1985) Ecology, 66, pp. 564-576; Chapin, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Physiological and growth responses of arctic plants to field experiment simulating climatic change (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 822-840; Chapin, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Response of arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Chesson, P., Huntly, N., The roles of harsh and fluctuating conditions in the dynamics of ecological communities (1997) American Naturalist, 150, pp. 519-553; Crawley, M.J., (1993) GLIM for Ecologists, , Blackwell, Oxford; Dormann, C.F., Brooker, R.W., Facilitation and competition in the High Arctic: The importance of experimental approach (2002) Acta Oecologica, 23, pp. 297-301; Dormann, C.F., Woodin, S.J., Climate change in the Arctic: Using plant functional types in a meta-analysis of field experiments (2002) Functional Ecology, 16, pp. 4-17; Dormann, C.F., Consequences of manipulations in carbon and nitrogen supply for concentrations of anti-herbivore defence compounds in Salix polaris (2003) Ecoscience, 10, pp. 312-318; Emanuel, W.R., Shugart, H.H., Stevenson, M.P., Climatic change and the broad-scale distribution of terrestrial ecosystem complexes (1985) Climatic Change, 7, pp. 29-43; Emmerton, K.S., Callaghan, T.V., Jones, H.E., Assimilation and isotopic fractionation of nitrogen by mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal subarctic plants (2001) New Phytologist, 151, pp. 513-524; Epstein, H.E., Walker, M.D., Chapin, F.S., A transient, nutrient-based model of arctic plant community response to climate warming (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 824-841; Gibson, D.J., Connolly, J., Hartnett D.C. et, al., Designs for greenhouse studies of interactions between species (1999) Journal of Ecology, 87, pp. 1-16; Glenn-Lewin, D.C., van der Maarel, E., Patterns and processes of vegetation dynamics (1992) Plant Succession, pp. 11-59. , (ed.
