In particular, it has directed attention to enormous climatic fluctuations that occurred in the very distant past, long before mankind appeared. The recent completion of the drilling phase of the Greenland Ice-core Project (GRIP) has already thrown much light on longterm changes in the Northern Hemisphere. It is clear that there were many substantial changes in mean temperature and in the course of the Gulf Stream during the last glaciation. © 1993.",,"climate fluctuation; glaciation; global warming; Greenland Ice-core Project; Gulf Stream; Greenland",,,,,,"Oeschger, Langway, Jr, The Environmental Record in Glaciers and Ice Sheets (1989) Dahlem Workshop Reports, 8, p. 400. , Physical, Chemical, and Earth Sciences Research Report, Wiley; Johnsen, Clausen, Dansgaard, Fuhrer, Gundestrup, Hammer, Iverson, Steffensen, (1992) Nature, Lond., 359, p. 311; Dansgaard, Johnsen, White, (1989) Nature, Lond., 339, p. 532",,,,,,,,,01609327,,ENDEA,,"English","Endeavour",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027385648
