LCI models for solid waste management (SWM) were also developed and used to compare environmental burdens of alternative SWM scenarios. Results from the LCI models showed that the estimated energy recovery from bioreactor landfilling was about 9.6 megajoules (MJ) per kilogram (kg) of waste. Air emissions from in-vessel composting contributed to a global warming potential (GWP) of 0.86 kg of CO2-equivalent per kg of waste, compared to 1.54 kg of CO2-equivalent from bioreactor landfill. Waterborne emissions contributing to aquatic toxicity is less coming from in-vessel composting than from bioreactor landfilling. However, emissions to air and water that contribute to human toxicity are greater for the composting option than for the landfill option. Full costs for in-vessel composting is about 6 times greater than for the landfilling alternative. Integration of individually collected commingled recyclables, yard wastes, and residual wastes with windrow composting and bioreactor landfilling produces airborne and waterborne emissions with the least environmental effects among the alternatives considered. It also yields greater energy savings due to the conversion of the landfill gas (LFG) to electrical energy than the option that diverts yard waste, food waste and soiled paper for aerobic in-vessel composting. However, this scenario costs 68% more than that where the commingled collection of wastes is integrated with in-vessel composting and conventional landfilling, owing to increased collection costs. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Bioreactor landfill; In-vessel composting; Life cycle inventory; Municipal solid waste management","Environmental impact; Inventory control; Land fill; Solid wastes; Toxicity; Waste management; Air emissions; Bioreactor landfill; Energy recovery; Life cycle inventory (LCI); Bioreactors",,,,,,"Barlaz, M.A., Comparing recycling, composting and landfills (2003) Biocycle, 449, pp. 60-66; Camobreco, V., Life-cycle inventory of a modern municipal solid waste landfill (1999) Waste Manag Res, 17, pp. 394-408; Clarke, W.P., Cost-benefit analysis of introducing technology to rapidly degrade municipal solid waste (2000) Waste Manag Res, 186, pp. 510-524; Degobert, P., (1995) Automobiles and Pollution, , Society of Automotive Engineers Warrendale, PA; Denison, R.A., Environmental life-cycle comparisons of recycling, landfilling, and incineration: A review of recent studies (1996) Annu Rev Energy Environ, 21, pp. 191-237; (1998) Full Cost Accounting in Action: Case Studies of Six Solid Waste Management Agencies, , EPA.
