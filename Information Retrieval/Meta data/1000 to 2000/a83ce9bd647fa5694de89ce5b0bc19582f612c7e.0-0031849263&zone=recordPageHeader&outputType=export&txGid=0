It uses an economic-engineering model for electric generation capacity expansion to investigate expansion plans which meet alternative CO2 emissions constraints in the lowest cost. The model selects the mix of various energy technologies, which are either presently in use or will possibly be in use in the future, to meet a specific carbon emissions limit and, furthermore, estimates the optimal tax required to achieve the least-cost strategy for reducing emissions to the desired level. Using Greece as a case study, the study suggests that to stabilize CO2 emissions at their 1990 level by the year 2005 and thereafter, the industry should move away from lignite generation to hydro and renewables and to coal or lignite technologies with CO2 removal capabilities. An optimal tax of $105 per ton of carbon is required to achieve this target in the lowest cost.","CO2 emissions; Electricity planning; Greece","carbon emission; electricity industry; emission control; global warming",,,,,,"Agostini, P., Butteon, M., Carraro, C., A carbon tax to reduce CO2 emissions in Europe (1992) Energy Economics, OCTOBER, pp. 279-290; Amagai, H., Leung, P., The trade-off between economic and environmental objectives in Japan's power sector (1991) The Energy Journal, 12 (3), pp. 95-104; Bellmann, R.E., (1957) Dynamic Programming, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J; Billinton, R., Allan, R.N., (1984) Reliability Evaluation of Power Systems, , Pitman Advanced Publishing Program, London; Booras, G.S., Smelser, S.C., An engineering and economic evaluation of CO2 removal from fossil-fuel-fired power plants (1991) Energy, 16 (11-12), pp. 1295-1305; Booth, R.R., Power system simulation model based on probability analysis (1972) Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Transactions (IEEE), Power Apparatus and Systems PAS, 91, pp. 62-69; A community strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to improve energy efficiency (1991) Communication from the Commission to the Council, , SEC (91) 1744 final, October; Decker, M., Faross, P., The energy consequences of the proposed carbon/energy tax (1992) Energy in Europe, 20, pp. 10-18. , December; Hendriks, C.A., Blok, K., Turkenburg, W.C., Technology and cost of removing and storing carbon dioxide from an integrated-gasifier, combined-cycle plant (1991) Energy, 16 (11-12), pp. 1277-1293; Electricity and the Environment (1991) Background Papers for a Senior Expert Symposium, , Helsinki, 13-17 May 1991, Report TEC-DOC-624, IAEA, Vienna; (1991) Renewable Energy Sources for Electricity Generation in Selected Development Countries, , Report TEC-DOC-646, Sept., IAEA, Vienna; (1993) Wien Automatic System Planning Package (WASP), 2. , IAEA.
