Despite a GHG increase that is nearly uniform in space, pronounced patterns emerge in both SST and precipitation. Regional differences in SST warming can be as large as the tropical-mean warming. Specifically, the tropical Pacific warming features a conspicuous maximum along the equator and a minimum in the southeast subtropics. The former is associated with westerly wind anomalies whereas the latter is linked to intensified southeast trade winds, suggestive of wind-evaporation-SST feedback. There is a tendency for a greater warming in the northern subtropics than in the southern subtropics in accordance with asymmetries in trade wind changes. Over the equatorial Indian Ocean, surface wind anomalies are easterly, the thermocline shoals, and the warming is reduced in the east, indicative of Bjerknes feedback. In the midlatitudes, ocean circulation changes generate narrow banded structures in SST warming. The warming is negatively correlated with wind speed change over the tropics and positively correlated with ocean heat transport change in the northern extratropics. A diagnostic method based on the ocean mixed layer heat budget is developed to investigate mechanisms for SST pattern formation. Tropical precipitation changes are positively correlated with spatial deviations of SST warming from the tropical mean. In particular, the equatorial maximum in SST warming over the Pacific anchors a band of pronounced rainfall increase. The gross moist instability follows closely relative SST change as equatorial wave adjustments flatten upper-tropospheric warming. The comparison with atmospheric simulations in response to a spatially uniform SST warming illustrates the importance of SST patterns for rainfall change, an effect overlooked in current discussion of precipitation response to global warming. Implications for the global and regional response of tropical cyclones are discussed. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric simulations; Banded structures; Bjerknes feedback; Diagnostic methods; Ensemble simulation; Equatorial Indian Ocean; Equatorial waves; Extratropics; Geophysical fluid dynamics laboratories; Heat budget; Midlatitudes; National center for atmospheric researches; Ocean circulation; Ocean heat transport; Ocean mixed layers; Ocean-atmosphere; Pattern formation; Regional response; Sea surface temperatures; Spatial deviation; Spatial variations; Surface wind anomalies; Trade winds; Tropical cyclone; Tropical precipitation; Tropospheric warming; Wind anomalies; Wind speed; Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Computer simulation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Ocean currents; Surface properties; Tropics; carbon emission; general circulation model; global warming; greenhouse gas; heat budget; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional pattern; sea surface temperature; spatial variation; trade wind; tropical region; westerly; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean",,,,,,"Alexander, M.A., Bladé, I., Newman, M., Lanzante, J.R., Lau, N.C., Scott, J.D., The atmospheric bridge: The influence of ENSO teleconnections on air-sea interaction over the global oceans (2002) J.
