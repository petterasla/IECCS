I explore reasons for the response, and conclude that there is an urgent need for comprehensive and wide-ranging change in universities to help mitigate GCC. My discussion is focused on those within universities as well as those in environmental professions regardless of their areas of specialization. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Climate change; Science and education; US university","Global climate changes; Science and education; US universities; Education; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Climate change; climate change; environmental education; geography education; university sector; bioethics; climate change; education program; environmental factor; environmental health; environmental sustainability; health hazard; human activities; human impact (environment); morality; political system; review; social aspect; specialization; United States; university; Environmental Health; Global Warming; Health Occupations; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Research; Science; United States; Universities; World Health; United States",,,,,,"(1990) The Liberal Art of Science: Agenda for Action, , http://www.aaas.org/programs/education/about_ehr/pubs/ the_liberal_art_of_science.pdf, Accessed 10 Jun. 2011; (2009) Letter to the US Senate, , http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2009/media/1021_letter.pdf, Accessed 27 Oct. 2010; (2006) Academic Freedom and Educational Responsibility, , http://www.aacu.org/about/statements/documents/academicFreedom.pdf, Washington, Accessed 18 Mar. 2011; Aldrich, J.L., Kormondy, E.J., Environmental education: Academia's response (1972) BioScience, 22, pp. 353-354; Allison, I., Bindoff, N.L., Bindschadler, R.A., Cox, P.M., De Noblet, N., England, M.H., Francis, J.E., Weaver, A.J., (2009) The Copenhagen Diagnosis: Updating the World on the Latest Climate, , http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/Copenhagen/Copenhagen_Diagnosis_LOW.pdf, Sydney, Australia, Accessed 22 Feb. 2011; (2006) C/o Second Nature, , http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org, Boston, Accessed 28 Sep. 2010; Anderegg, W.R.L., Prall, J.W., Harold, J., Schneider, S.H., Expert credibility in climate change (2010) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the National Academies of Sciences, , 21 Jun. 2010, Washington. doi:10.1073/pnas.1003187107; Anderson, K., Bows, A., Reframing the climate change challenge in light of post-2000 emission trends (2008) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 366, pp. 3863-3882; The anti-science strain pervading the right wing in the United States is the last thing the country needs in a time of economic challenge (2010) Nature, 467, p. 133. , http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7312/full/467133a.html, Accessed 18 Mar. 2011; Arrhenius, S., (1908) Worlds in the Making, , Harper and Brothers, New York; Baer, P., Athanasiou, T., Kartha, S., Kemp-Benedictet, E., The greenhouse development rights framework: The right to develop in a climate constrained world (2008) Heinrich Böll Foundation, Christian Aid, , EcoEquity and the Stockholm Environment Institute, Stockholm; Baer, P., Athanasiou, T., Kartha, S., A 350 ppm emergency pathway.
