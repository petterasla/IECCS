Under the Kyoto Protocol, GWP can be used as a fixed index to govern the trade-off between different GHGs in a multi-gas approach to GHGs abatement. The use of fixed GWPs has been criticized for not being very cost effective compared to the use of some flexible indices. To gain wider acceptance, however, a flexible index must also prove to be easy to use, and the economic gains from its adoption must be significant. In this paper, we develop a flexible index based on the concept of marginal rather than cumulative or average global warming potentials. These marginal global warming potentials (MGWPs) can be endogenously determined within a climate model given a particular climate objective based on radiative forcing level. The MGPWs are then linked to the marginal abatement costs of the GHGs, which are also endogenously determined within an economic model. When the two concepts are linked in this way, the result is a cost-effective way of achieving a particular climate change objective with multigas abatement. We show that the savings in costs when using this flexible MGPWs can be significant, and more importantly, they are not uniformly distributed across different regions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Global warming potential; Integrated assessment; Marginal abatement cost; Model coupling",,,,,,,"Aaheim, A., Fuglestvedt, J.S., Godal, O., Costs savings of a flexible multi-gas climate policy (2006) The Energy Journal, Multi-Greenhouse Gas Mitigation and Climate Policy Special Issue, pp. 485-501; Albritton, D.L., Derwent, R.G., Isaksen, I.S.A., Lal, M., Wuebbles, D.J., Houghton, J.T., Meira Filho, L.G., Haites, E., Trace gas radiative forcing indices (1995) Climate Change 1994: Radiative Forcing of Climate Change and An Evaluation of the IPCC IS92 Emissions Scenarios, pp. 205-231. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Bruckner, T., Hooss, G., Fuessel, H.-M., Hasselmann, K., Climate system modelling in the framework of the tolerable windows approach: The ICLIPS climate model (2003) Climatic Change, 56, pp. 119-137; Burniaux, J.-M., (2002) Incorporating Carbon Sequestration into CGE Models: A Prototype GTAP Model with Land Uses, , Draft GTAP Technical Paper, Center for Global Trade Analysis, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA; Burniaux, J.-M., Truong, T., GTAP-E: An energy-environmental version of the GTAP Model (2002) GTAP Technical Paper No. 16, , Center for Global Trade Analysis, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA; Fuglestvedt, J.S., Berntsen, T.K., Godal, O., Sausen, R., Shine, K.P., Skodvin, T., Metrics of climate change: Assessing radiative forcing and emission indices (2003) Climatic Change, 58, pp. 267-331; Hammitt, J.K., Jain, A.K., Adams, J.L., Wuebbles, D.J., A Welfare-based index for assessing environmental effects of greenhouse-gas emissions (1996) Nature, 381, pp. 301-303; Harvey, L.D.D., Gregory, J., Hoffert, M., Jain, A., Lal, M., Leemans, R., An introduction to simple climate models used in the IPCC second assessment report (1997) IPCC Technical Paper II, IPCC, , J.
