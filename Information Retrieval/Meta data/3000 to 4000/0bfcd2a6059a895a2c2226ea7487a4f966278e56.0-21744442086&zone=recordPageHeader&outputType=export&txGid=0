Terrestrial C sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Land use, vegetation and soil management have a strong impact on the biotic processes of C sequestration. Losses of C from the terrestrial ecosystems are exacerbated by deforestation, biomass burning, plowing, resource-based and subsistence agriculture, and practices that mine soil fertility and deplete the soil organic C (SOC) pool. Biomass burning may also produce charcoal, which is an inert carbon with long residence time. Practices that enhance C sequestration include afforestation and reforestation, conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and adopting systems with high biodiversity. Net C sequestration within an ecosystem can be assessed by taking into account the hidden C costs of fertilizers, pesticides, tillage, irrigation and other input. Restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems has a vast potential of C sequestration. The Kyoto Protocol provides for C sequestration in terrestrial sinks and C trading through Clean Development Mechanisms. Terrestrial C sequestration, besides being a win-win strategy, offers a window of opportunity for the first few decades of the 21st century. It is a natural process of reducing the rates of gaseous emissions while alternatives to fossil fuel take effect. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Conservation tillage; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil organic matter dynamics; Soil quality; Terrestrial carbon pool","agriculture; agroecology; carbon cycle; nutrient cycling",,,,,,"Allison, F.E., (1973) Soil Organic Matter and Its Role in Crop Production, , Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., New York; Arnalds, O., Porarinsdottir, E.F., Metusalemsson, S., Jonsson, A., Arnason, E.G.O.A., (2001) Soil Erosion in Iceland, 121p. , Soil Conservation Service, Agricultural Research Institute, Reykjavik, Iceland; Arnalds, O., Aradottir, A.L., Gudbergsson, G., Organic carbon sequestration by restoration of severely degraded areas in Iceland (2002) Agricultural Practices and Policies for Carbon Sequestration in Soil, pp. 267-280. , Kimble J.M., Lal R. and Follett R.F.
