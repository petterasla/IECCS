In many respects, the warmth of the Middle Pliocene is similar to the probable warm situation of the late 21st century predicted by climate models. Understanding the Middle Pliocene climate is important in predicting the future climate with global warming. Here, we used the latest reconstructions for the Middle Pliocene-Pliocene Research Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) version 3-to simulate the Middle Pliocene climate with a fully coupled model Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model. From comparison of the results of simulations with reconstructions, we considered two important scientific topics of Middle Pliocene climate modeling: extreme warming in the subpolar North Atlantic and a permanent El Niño in the tropical Pacific. Our simulations illustrate that the global annual mean sea surface temperature (SST) in the Middle Pliocene was about 2. 3°C higher than that in the pre-industrial era. The warming was stronger at mid- and high latitudes than at low latitudes. The simulated SST changes agree with SST reconstructions in PRISM3 data, especially for the North Atlantic, North Pacific and west coast of South America. However, there were still discrepancies between the simulation of the SST and reconstructions for the subpolar North Atlantic and tropical Pacific. In the case of the Atlantic, the weakened meridional overturning circulation in the simulation did not support the reconstruction of the extremely warm condition in the subpolar North Atlantic. In the case of the tropical Pacific, the whole ocean warmed, especially the eastern tropical Pacific, which did not support the permanent El Niño suggested by the reconstruction. From evaluation of the modeling and reconstruction, we suggest that the above discrepancies were due to uncertainties in reconstructions, difficulties in paleoclimate modeling and deficiencies of climate models. The discrepancies should be reduced through consideration of both the modeling and data. © 2011 The Author(s).","extreme warming; Middle Pliocene; numerical modeling; permanent El Niño; sea surface temperature",,,,,,,"An, Z.S., Huang, Y.S., Liu, W.G., Multiple expansions of C4 plant biomass in East Asia since 7 Ma coupled with strengthened monsoon circulation (2005) Geology, 33, pp. 705-708; Ding, Z.L., Derbyshire, E., Yang, S.L., Stacked 2.6-Ma grain size record from the Chinese loess based on five sections and correlation with the deep-sea δ18O record (2002) Paleoceanography, 17, p. 1033; Guo, Z.T., Ruddiman, W.F., Hao, Q.Z., Onset of Asian desertification by 22 Myr ago inferred from loess deposits in China (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 159-163; Wang, Y.J., Cheng, H., Edwards, R.L., A high-resolution absolute-dated late Pleistocene monsoon record from Hulu Cave, China (2001) Science, 294, pp. 2345-2348; Fang, X.M., Zhao, Z.J., Li, J.J., Magnetostratigraphy of the late Cenozoic Laojunmiao anticline in the northern Qilian Mountains and its implications for the northern Tibetan Plateau uplift (2005) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 48, pp. 1040-1051; Wu, N.Q., Rousseau, D.D., Liu, X.P., Response of mollusk assemblages from the Luochuan loess section to orbital forcing since the last 250 ka (2000) Chinese Sci Bull, 45, pp. 1617-1622; Zhu, M., Ding, Z.L., Wang, X., High-resolution carbon isotope record for the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum from the Nanyang Basin, Central China (2010) Chinese Sci Bull, 55, pp. 3606-3611; Jiang, D.B., Wang, H.J., Drange, H., Last glacial maximum over China: Sensitivities of climate to paleovegetation and Tibetan ice sheet (2003) J Geophys Res, 108, p. 4102; Liu, X.D., Yin, Z.Y., Sensitivity of East Asian monsoon climate to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (2002) Palaeogeogr Palaeoclimatol Palaeoecol, 183, pp. 223-245; Wang, H.J., Role of vegetation and soil in the Holocene megathermal climate over China (1999) J Geophys Res, 104, pp. 9361-9367; Zhang, Z.S., Wang, H.J., Guo, Z.T., What triggers the transition of palaeoenvironmental patterns in China, the Tibetan Plateau uplift or the Paratethys sea retreat?
