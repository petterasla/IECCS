The investigated watersheds are located in northern Sweden close to the Arctic Circle. An elevated spring flow peak due to snowmelt characterizes the hydrology of boreal and arctic river systems. During this snowmelt, total organic carbon (TOC), previously stored as soil carbon, is flushed and exported from the watersheds, and can be released to the atmosphere via heterotrophic remineralization during riverine transport to the sea, thereby contributing to atmospheric CO2. The TOC yields of the watersheds investigated increased with 2 vegetation and peat cover and ranged across watersheds from 0.5 to 2.8 tons km-2 yr-1 During frozen periods, streamflow is dominated by ""old"" groundwater. This water has percolated through the soils and is rich in DSi and bicarbonate; that is, atmospheric carbon that has been ""consumed"" in chemical weathering processes is partly exported as bicarbonate to the sea, where carbon is stored as CaCO3 for geological time. The bicarbonate export of the watersheds investigated was between 0.4 and 1.2 tons C km-2 yr-1 corresponding to 15-73% of the TOC export. Very likely, global warming will affect water flow through the soils in taiga and tundra ecosystems and thus will have an effect on watershed carbon budgets. This bicarbonate export may compensate for significant amounts of the exported TOC, thereby reducing the positive feedback to atmospheric CO2.
