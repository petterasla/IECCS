A number of valuable natural ecosystems (both, marine and terrestrial) containing rare plant communities often rich in species, but also suitable breeding places for birds will be in danger. Most sandy beaches high in recreative value will disappear. However, isostatic land uplift and location of coastal settlements at a distance from the present coastline reduce the rate of risk. Four case study areas characterizing all the shore types of Estonia have been selected for sea-level rise vulnerability and adaptation assessment. Preliminary results and estimates of vulnerability to 1.0 m sea-level rise by 2075 for two case study areas-Hiiumaa, West-Estonian Archipelago and Pamu-Ikla, south-western coast of the mainland are presented in this paper.",,"Aves; coastal zone; environmental impact; global change; sea level rise; Estonia",,,,,,"Ingelög, T., Andersson, R., Tjernberg, M., (1993) Red Data Book of the Baltic Region 1, p. 95. , Lists of Threatened Vascular Plants and Vertebrates, Uppsala, Riga; Orviku, K., Sepp, U., Stages of Geological Development and Landscape Types of the Islets of the West-Estonian Archipelago (1972) Geogr.
