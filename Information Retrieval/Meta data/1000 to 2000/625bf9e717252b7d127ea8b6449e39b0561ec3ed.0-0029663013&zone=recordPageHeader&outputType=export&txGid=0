These increases are accompanied by phase advances of about seven days during the declining phase of the cycle, suggesting a lengthening of the growing season. The annual amplitudes also show maxima which appear to reflect a sensitivity to global warming episodes that peaked in 1981 and 1990. This may reflect increasing assimilation of CO2 by land plants in response to climate changes accompanying recent rapid increases in temperature.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climatic change; global change; growing season; Arctic; USA, Hawaii; Embryophyta; carbon dioxide; air temperature; arctic climate; article; atmosphere; carbon dioxide fixation; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; plant growth; priority journal; seasonal variation; vegetation",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,,"Keeling, C.D.; Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla CA 92093-0220, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663013
