Particular emphasis is placed on the two most prominent issues: acid rain and global warming. More emphasis is given to supply-side issues rather than demand-side responses (such as least cost planning). The paper then examines the major characteristics of the UK's stock of generating plant and some of the means available for the ESI to adjust this stock in the light of both specific environmental and wider political pressures.",,"Acid rain; Electricity; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Electricity generation; Global warming; Electric power generation",,,,,,,"Chesshire, J.; Univ of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,0960764X,,IPATE,,"English","IEE Proc Part A Sci Meas Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027206219
