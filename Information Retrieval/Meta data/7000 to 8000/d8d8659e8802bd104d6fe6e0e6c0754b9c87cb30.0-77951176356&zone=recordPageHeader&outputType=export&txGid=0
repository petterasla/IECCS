The focus was on a new application of reactive absorption associated with CO2 capture, especially in a pre-combustion mode. This mode required natural gas processing but offered the possibility of CO 2 capture under advantageously high pressures which decreased the operational costs. The presented rate-based method was based on physical quantities which characterised the process, i.e. first of all species on the absorption flux as a function of the reactor height without the utilisation of empirical parameters. Therefore, the presented method was enough general and suitable for describing of any reactive absorption and desorption including the practical system CO2-H2S-amines-water-natural gas. The elementary equations of the method were given in Eqs. (1-9). A design approach, which utilized the described rate-based method, allowed precise process design of new purification and processing installations for natural gas and the operative optimization of the existing ones. Referring to the discussions from the DC KNT Rynek Gazu 2009 this paper presented the role of CO2 in the global wanning, its climatic and economic consequences and up-to-date proposals for political, economic, scientific and innovative solutions.","CO2 capture; Gas-liquid systems; Global warming; Natural gas; Process design",,,,,,,"Barczyński, A., (2009) Wprowadzenie Biogazu Do Systemu Dystrybucyjnego - Szanse i Mozliwosci, , W ""Rynek Gazu 2009"". red.
