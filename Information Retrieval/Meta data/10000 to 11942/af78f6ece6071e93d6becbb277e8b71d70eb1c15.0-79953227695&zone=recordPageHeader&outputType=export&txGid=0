The SEM-EDX results showed that EC particles emitted from diesel bus are 50nm spherical particles with smooth surface and an O/C ratio (mass ratio) of 0.07±0.01. The 50nm EC particles were further deduced to be an aggregate of new fullerene C36(OH)2 according to the results of MALDI-TOF-MS, FT-IR and 13C NMR. Fullerenes smaller than 60C were considered to be unstable since they cannot fulfill the so-called isolated pentagon rule. So far, most of our knowledge regarding small fullerenes comes from gas-phase experiments and theoretical investigations, the production and separation of small fullerene solids in the macroscopic quantity has been reported. The present report is the first discovery of C36(OH)2-based solid. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Black carbon particle; Elemental carbon particle; Small fullerene; Soot","Black carbon; Chemical characterization;
