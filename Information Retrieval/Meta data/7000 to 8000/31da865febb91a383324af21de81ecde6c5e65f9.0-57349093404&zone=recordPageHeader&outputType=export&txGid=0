Our study aims to quantify the relationship between exposure to extreme high temperatures and renal morbidity in South Australia. Methods: Poisson regression accounting for over dispersion, seasonality and long-term trend was used to estimate the effect of heat waves on hospital admissions for renal disease, acute renal failure and renal dialysis over a 12-year period. Selected comorbidities were investigated as possible contributing risk factors. Results: Admissions for renal disease and acute renal failure were increased during heat waves compared with non-heat wave periods with an incidence rate ratio of 1.100 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.003-1.206] and 1.255 (95% CI 1.037-1.519), respectively. Hospitalizations for dialysis showed no corresponding increase. Comorbid diabetes did not increase the risk of renal admission, however 'effects of heat and light' and 'exposure to excessive natural heat' (collectively termed effects of heat) were identified as risk factors. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that as heat waves become more frequent, the burden of renal morbidity may increase in susceptible individuals as an indirect consequence of global warming. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved.","Acute renal failure; Global warming; Heat waves; Kidney disease; Weather","dehydration; global warming; hospital sector; morbidity; regression analysis; seasonality; temperate environment; acute kidney failure; adolescent; adult; aged; article; Australia; child; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; environmental temperature; female; greenhouse effect; heat injury; high temperature; hospital admission; human; infant; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; priority journal; renal replacement therapy; risk assessment; risk factor; seasonal variation; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Climate; Comorbidity; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Hospitalization; Hot Temperature; Humans; Incidence; Kidney Failure, Acute; Male; Middle Aged; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Australasia; Australia; South Australia",,,,,,"McMichael, A.J., Woodruff, F., Whetton, P., (2002) Human Health and Climate Change in Oceania: A Risk Assessment, , Canberra: Commonwealth of Australia; Semenza, J.C., McCullough, J.E., Flanders, W.D., McGeehin, M.A., Lumpkin, J.R., Excess hospital admissions during the July 1995 heat wave in Chicago (1999) Am J Prev Med, 16, pp. 269-277; Kovats, R.S., Ebi, K.L., Heatwaves and public health in Europe (2006) Eur J Public Health, 16, pp. 592-599; Dematte, J.E., O'Mara, K., Buescher, J., Near-fatal heat stroke during the 1995 heat wave in Chicago (1998) Ann Intern Med, 129, pp. 173-181; Kovats, R.S., Hajat, S., Wilkinson, P., Contrasting patterns of mortality and hospital admissions during hot weather and heat waves in Greater London, UK (2004) Occup Environ Med, 61, pp. 893-898; Tan, W., Herzlich, B.C., Funaro, R., Rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric acute renal failure associated with classic heat stroke (1995) South Med J, 88, pp. 1065-1068; World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe.
