Most geological reference materials have very poor quality sulfur results, that is with relative standard deviations (RSD) in the range of 30-50%, even for concentrations over 100 μg g-1 S, which compromises their use as calibrators. In order to provide modern results with low RSD, sulfur was determined in twenty-nine geological reference materials with a state-of-the-art elemental S/C analyser using metal chips (certified reference materials with a traceability link) and analytical grade sulfur for high concentration samples. Analytical parameters (sample mass, crucible degassing, calibration strategy, etc.) were optimised by testing. Our results agreed with reference material values provided by issuing bodies. Results for CCRMP SY-2 (129 ± 13 μg g-1 S), which has been proposed as a sulfur reference material, were in agreement with the proposed modern value of 122 ± 3.7 μg g-1 S. © 2008 The Authors.
