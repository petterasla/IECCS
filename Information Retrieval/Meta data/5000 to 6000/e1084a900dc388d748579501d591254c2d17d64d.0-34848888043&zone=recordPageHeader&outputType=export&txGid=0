Design/methodology/approach - Single index weighting indices within the impact methodology Life cycle Impact Assessment Method based on Endpoint Modelling (LIME) impact methodology, were applied to the flows of three life cycle inventory models and their globally related flows. The LIME results based on three environmental impact categories, i.e. resource consumption, global warming and ozonelayer depletion are presented and discussed. Findings - The attributional LCA (ALCA) results point towards a larger impact for Sn95.5Ag3.8Cu0.7 than Sn63Pb37 mostly due to the higher Sn and Ag content. This study confirms earlier similar ALCAs. The system expansion for the Consequential LCA (CLCA) did not change this conclusion. Research limitations/implications - The present study has not included the affected microelectronics packaging parts of electronic products, nor has it included toxic effects as they are local. ALCA was considered to be equal to CLCA for Sn95.5Ag3.8Cu0.7, where no Ag nor Sn recycling was included. Originality/value - For the first time a global environmental impact assessment of the shift to Pb-free solder paste using the LIME weighting method applied to a CLCA is reported. Environmental life-cycle investigations intended to support decisions of an ecological nature in the microelectronics packaging industry should benefit from the consequential approach. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental management; Life cycle costs; Modelling; Solders","Electronics packaging; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Global warming; Life cycle; Microelectronics; Inventory models; Life cycle costs; Ozonelayer depletion; Resource consumption; Soldering alloys",,,,,,"Abou-Zahr, C., Disability adjusted life years (DALYS) and reproductive health: A critical analysis (1999) Reproductive Health Matters, 7 (14), pp. 118-29; Afgan, N.H., Pilavachi, P.A., Carvalho, M.G., Multi-criteria evaluation of natural gas resources (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (1), pp. 704-13; Althaus, H.J., Classen, M., Life cycle inventories of metals and methodological aspects of inventorying material resources in ecoinvent (2005) International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 10 (1), pp. 43-9; Andræ, A.S.G., Liu, J., Consequential toxicity assessment of the global shift to Pb-free solder paste (2006) Proceedings of the International Conference on Electronics Packaging, 19-21 April, Tokyo, Japan, pp. 298-303; Andræ, A.S.G., Andersson, D.R., Liu, J., Significance of intermediate production processes in life cycle assessment of electronic products assessed using a generic compact model (2005) Journal of Cleaner Production, 13 (1314), pp. 1269-79; Asif, M., Muneer, T., Energy supply, its demand and security issues for developed and emerging economies (2007) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 11 (7), pp. 1388-413; Codde, (2007) Environmental Information & Management Explorer (EIME).
