In this paper we report on findings on carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes above a sedge-dominated fen at Zackenberg (74°28'N, 20°34' W) in The National Park of North and East Greenland. Eddy covariance measurements were initiated at the start of the growing season and terminated shortly before its end lasting 45 days. The net CO2 flux during daytime reaches a high of 10 μmol m-2s-1, and around the summer solstice, net CO2 assimilation occurred at midnight, resulting in net carbon gain during the night. The measured carbon dioxide fluxes compare well to estimates based on the photosynthesis model by Collatz et al. (1991). The total growing-season net ecosystem CO2 exchange was estimated to be 96 g C m-2 based on the carbon dioxide model and micrometeorological data. Finally, the combined CO2 assimilation and soil respiration models are used for examining the dependence of the carbon dioxide budget on temperature. The ecosystem is found to function optimally given the present temperature conditions whereas either an increase or a decrease in temperature would reduce the ecosystem CO2 accumulation. An increase in temperature by 5°C would turn the ecosystem into a carbon dioxide source.","Arctic; Carbon dioxide; Eddy covariance; Net ecosystem exchange; Photosynthesis","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; fen; global warming; photosynthesis; water vapor; Greenland; Carex adelostoma",,,,,,"Baldocchi, D.B., Hicks, B.B., Meyers, T.P., Measuring biosphere-atmosphere exchange of biologically related gases with micrometeorological methods (1988) Ecology, 69, pp. 1331-1340; Billings, W.D., Peterson, K.M., Luken, J.O., Mortensen, D.A., Interaction of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and soil nitrogen on the carbon balance of tundra microcosmos (1984) Oecologia, 65, pp. 26-29; Bliss, L.C., Matveyeva, N.V., Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation (1992) Arctic Ecosystems in a Changing Climate. an Ecophysio'iogical Perspective, pp. 59-89. , eds Chapin FS III, Jefferies RL, Reynolds JF, Shaver GR, Svoboda J , Academic Press, London; Chapman, S.J., Thurlow, M., The Influence of Climate on CO2 and CH4 emission from organic soils (1996) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 79, pp. 2C5-217; Christensen, T.R., Kaplan, J., Haxeltine, A., Stich, S., Methane flux from northern wetlands and tundra (1996) Tellus, 48 B, pp. 652-661; Collate, G.J., Ball, J.T., Grivet, C., Berry, J.A., Physiological and environmental regulation of stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration: A model that includes a laminar boundary layer (1991) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 54, p. 107136; Coyne, P.I., Jj, K., Variations in carbon dioxide across an arctic snowpack during spring (1974) Journal of Geophysical Research, 76, pp. 799-802; Coync, P.I., Kelly, J.J., CO2 exchange in the Alaskan tundra: Meteorological assessment by the aerodynamical method (1975) Journal of Applied Ecology, 12, pp. 587-611; De Pury, D.G.G., Farquhar, G.D., Simple scaling of photosynthesis from weaves to canopies without the errors of bigleaf models (1997) Plant, Ce', and Environment, 20, pp. 537-557; DM (1997) Danish Meteorological Institute - temperature records from GreenlandEhleringer, J., Pearcy, W., Variation in Quantum Yield for CO2 Uptake among C;, and C4 plants (1983) Plant Physiology, 73, pp. 555-559; Farquhar, G.D., Von Caermerer, S., Barry, J.A., A Biochemical Model of Photosvntheitic CO2 assimilation in leaves of C3 plants (1980) Planta, 149, pp. 78-90; Friborg, T., Christensen, T.R., Soegaard, H., Rapid response of greenhouse gas emission to early spring thaw in a subarctic mire as shown by micro-meteorological techniques (1997) Geophysical Research Letters, 24 (23), pp. 3061-3066; Funk, D.W., Pullman, E.K., Peterson, K.M., Grill, P.M., Billings, W.D., Influence of water table on carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane fluxes from taiga bog microcosmos (1994) Global Biogcochemcal Cycles, S, pp. 271-278; Hanan, N., Kabat, P., Dolman, H., Eibers, I., Photosynthesis and carbon balance of a Sahelian fallow savanna (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 523-538; Haxeltine, A., A General model for light use efficiency of primary production (1996) Functional Ecology, 10, pp. 551-561; Hinzman, L.D., Bauer, M.E., Daughtry, C.S.T., Effects of Nitrogen fertilization on Growth and Reflectance Characteristics of Winter Wheat (1986) Remote Sensing of Environment, 19, pp. 47-61; Hunt, H.W., Elliott, E.T., Detling, J.K., Morgan, J.A., Chen, D.X., Response of a C3 and a Gj perennial grass to elevated CO2 and temperature under different water regimes (1996) Global Change Biology, 2, pp. 35-37; Kane, D.L., Hinzman, L.D., Woo, M., Everett, K.R., Arctic Hydrology and Climate Change (1992) Arctic Ecosystems in a Changing Climate. an Ecophysiological Perspective, pp. 35-58. , eds Chapin FS III, Jefferies RL, Reynolds JF, Shaver GR, Svoboda J, Academic Press, London; Kattenberg, A., Giorgi, F., Grassl, H., Meehl, G.A., Mitchell, F.B., Stouffer, R.J., Tokioka, T., Wigley, T.M.L., Climate models - Projections of future climate (1996) Climate C'nange 1995.
