The fertilization and early embryogenesis of four reef-building coral species representing three Indo-Pacific families were examined in a series of laboratory experiments where temperatures were increased up to 5-6°C at ambient. High levels of fertilization and normal embryogenesis were observed for Favites abdita, Favites chinensis and Mycedium elephantotus at temperatures to 32°C (+5°C) and embryos developed normally until the 5th cell cleavage. Acropora millepora was the only species to be affected by higher temperatures, exhibiting significantly reduced fertilization and a higher frequency of embryonic abnormalities at 32°C (+4°C), and fertilization ceased altogether at 34°C (+6°C). Early cell cleavage rates increased with temperature up to 32°C for all species. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Climate change; Coral; Fertilization; Global warming; Reproduction; Temperature","climate change; coral reef; embryonic development; environmental effect; environmental stress; laboratory method; molecular analysis; seawater; Acropora millepora; Anthozoa; Favites abdita; Favites chinensis; Mycedium elephantotus",,,,,,"Bassim, K.M., Sammarco, P.W., Effects of temperature and ammonium on larval development and survivorship in a scleractinian coral Diploria strigosa (2003) Mar Biol, 142, pp. 241-252; Bassim, K.M., Sammarco, P.W., Snell, T.L., Effects of temperature on success of (self and non-self) fertilization and embryogenesis in Diploria strigosa (Cnidaria, Scleractinia) (2002) Mar Biol, 140, pp. 479-488; Berkelmans, R., Oliver, J.K., Large-scale bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 55-60; Berkelmans, R., Willis, B.L., Seasonal and local spatial patterns in the upper thermal limits of corals on the inshore Central Great Barrier Reef (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 219-228; Brown, B.E., Downs, C.A., Dunne, R.P., Gibb, S.W., Exploring the basis of thermotolerance in the reef coral Goniastrea aspera (2002) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 242, pp. 119-129; Edmunds, P., Gates, R., Gleason, D., The biology of larvae from the reef coral Porites astreoides, and their response to temperature disturbances (2001) Mar Biol, 139, pp. 981-989; Harrison, P.L., Wallace, C.C., Dubinsky, Z., Reproduction, dispersal and recruitment of scleractinian corals (1990) Coral Reefs (Ecosystems of the World; 25), pp. 133-207. , Elsevier Science Publishing Company New York; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's coral reefs (1999) Mar Freshw Res, 50, pp. 839-866; Climate Change 2007: The Physical Basis (2007) Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , http://www.ipcc.ch/, IPCC Geneva.
