We examined the instantaneous and stratospheric adjusted radiative efficiencies of HFCs for clear-sky and all-sky conditions. We also calculated the radiative forcing of HFCs from preindustrial times to the present and for future scenarios given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES, in short). Global warming potential and global temperature potential were then examined and compared on the basis of the calculated radiative efficiencies. Finally, we discuss surface temperature changes due to various HFC emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Correlated k-distribution; Global temperature potential (GTPs); Global warming potential (GWPs); HFCs; Radiative forcing","Global temperatures; Global warming potential (GWPs); HFCs; K-Distribution; Radiative forcings; Global warming; air temperature; global warming; hydrofluorocarbon; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; parameterization; radiative forcing; stratosphere; surface temperature",,,,,,"(2007), http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-syr.htm, IPCC Climate change 2007: the physical science basis.
