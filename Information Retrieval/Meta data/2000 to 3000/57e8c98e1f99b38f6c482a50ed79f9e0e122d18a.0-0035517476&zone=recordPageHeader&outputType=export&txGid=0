Potential impacts of climate change on buildings are identified, evaluated as to how serious they might be, and actions are considered to ensure that future building performance is not compromised. Climate change scenarios for New Zealand defined the scale of climate changes considered for building performance. For each climate variable, relevant aspects of building performance were examined to determine if there is likely to be a significant impact. Where significant impacts were indicated, they were studied in detail and quantified where possible. A risk-profiling tool was formulated to cover the risk/severity of the most significant climate change impacts, which include flooding, tropical cyclones and overheating. Adaptation strategies were developed for each climate change impact, with different responses appropriate for each impact. Mitigation of greenhouse emissions is also addressed. For those risks where delaying action has serious consequences, it may be appropriate to consider changes in building or zoning regulations to anticipate the future impacts of climate change. Some implications for future building performance, design, standards and regulation are discussed.","Building performance; Building stock; Climate change; Global warming; New Zealand; Property; Risk assessment; Trends","Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Research and development management; Risk assessment; Strategic planning; Structural analysis; Building performance; Building stock; Property; Buildings",,,,,,"Bassett, M.R., Bishop, R.C., Van De Werff, I.S., (1990) ALF Manual: Annual Loss Factor Design Manual, , Building Research Association of New Zealand, Judgeford, Wellington; (1991) Building Regulations (and Amendments), , BIA; Government Printer, Wellington, New Zealand; (1992) New Zealand Building Code Approved Document E1: Surface Water, , BIA; Building Industry Authority, Wellington; (2001) Coping with Climate Change.
