The results indicate that there are long-run equilibrium relationships between these variables. Additionally, causality from energy consumption to CO2 emissions was observed generally, but there were some opposite relationships also. Parameter estimations of the panel data model indicate that there are great differences in the carbon emissions, the efficiencies of energy use, carbon emissions of unit GDP and unit energy consumption between developed and developing countries. The base carbon emissions, per capita energy consumption and efficiency of energy use in developing countries are far lower than in developed countries; however, the CO2 emissions per unit of energy use is higher. Although developing countries may reduce their CO2 emission per unit energy use, total energy consumption will rise rapidly with economic development. Thus, developing countries must determine how to undergo economic growth while conserving energy and reducing emissions. To respond to global climate change, it is necessary to develop innovative technology for energy use, transform the energy structure and conduct the clean development mechanism. © 2011.","Carbon emissions; Energy consumption; Panel data model","Carbon emissions; Clean Development Mechanism; Comparative analysis; Developed countries; Economic development; Economic growths; Emissions reduction; Energy consumption; Energy structures; Energy use; GDP growth; Global climate changes; Innovative technology; Panel data; Panel data model; Panel data models; Per capita; Per unit; Total energy consumption; Climate change; Developing countries; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Innovation; Models; Parameter estimation; Energy efficiency; carbon emission; clean development mechanism; climate change; comparative study; developing world; economic development; economic growth; emission control; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; innovation; panel data; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim",,,,,,"Al-Iriani, M.A., Energy-GDP relationship revisited: an example from GCC countries using panel causality (2006) Energy Policy, 34, pp. 3342-3350; Ang, J.B., CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and output in France (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 4772-4778; Bernstein, P.M., Montgomery, W., Tuladhar, S.D., Potential for reducing carbon emissions from non-Annex B countries through changes in technology (2006) Energy Economics, 28, pp. 742-762; (2006), BP World Energy Statistics YearbookBreitung, J., The local power of some unit root tests for panel data (2000) Advances in Econometrics, Volume 15: Nonstationary Panels, Panel Cointegration, and Dynamic Panels, pp. 161-178. , JAY Press, Amsterdam; Ciarreta, A., Zarraga, A., Economic growth-electricity consumption causality in 12 European countries: a dynamic panel data approach (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 3790-3796; Costantini, V., Martini, C., The causality between energy consumption and economic growth: a multi-sectoral analysis using non-stationary cointegrated panel data (2009) Energy Economics, 32, pp. 591-603; Dickey, D.A., Fuller, W.A., Distribution of the estimators for autoregressive time series with a unit root (1979) Journal of the American Statistical Society, 75, pp. 427-431; Dinda, S., Coondoo, D., Income and emission: a panel data-based cointegration analysis (2006) Ecological Economics, 57, pp. 167-181; Engle, R.F., Granger, C.W.J., Cointegration and error-correction: representation, estimation and testing (1987) Econometrica, 55, pp. 251-276; Erol, U., Yu, E.S.H., On the relationship between electricity and income for industrialized countries (1987) Journal of Electricity and Employment, 13, pp. 113-122; Fatai, K., Oxley, L., Scrimgeour, F.G., Modelling the causal relationship between energy consumption and GDP in New Zealand, Australia, India, Indonesia, The Philippines and Thailand (2004) Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 64, pp. 431-445; Granger, C.W.J., Investigating causal relations by econometric models and crossspectral methods (1969) Econometrica, 37, pp. 424-438; Granger, C.W.J., Causality, cointegration and control (1988) Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 12, pp. 551-559; Haakon, V., Kristin, A., He, J.W., Benefits and costs to China of three different climate treaties (2009) Resource and Energy Economics, 31, pp. 139-160; Halicioglu, F., An econometric study of CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and foreign trade in Turkey (2009) Energy Policy, 37, pp. 1156-1164; Hsiao, C., (2003) Analysis of Panel Data, , Cambridge University Press; Huang, B.N., Hwang, M.J., Yang, C.W., Causal relationship between energy consumption and GDP growth revisited: a dynamic panel data approach (2008) Ecological Economics, 67, pp. 41-54; Im, K.S., Pesaran, M.H., Shin, Y., Testing for unit roots in heterogeneous panels (2003) Journal of Econometrics, 115, pp. 53-74; Johansen, S., Estimation and hypothesis-testing of cointegration vectors in Gaussian vector autoregressive models (1991) Econometrica, 59, pp. 1551-1580; (2007), http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de, Karaman Orsal,.
