The two most significant emissions are carbon dioxide and methane. A significant fraction of emissions is emitted by oil and gas production and transportation facilities. Because methane has at least 21 times the greenhouse gas potential of carbon dioxide, it is advantageous to convert methane to carbon dioxide via combustion, even if the carbon dioxide is vented to the atmosphere. Fugitive methane combustion does however present certain difficulties in its combustion. This paper presents an overview of the problem and suggests some possible catalytic reactor technologies appropriate for the solution. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
