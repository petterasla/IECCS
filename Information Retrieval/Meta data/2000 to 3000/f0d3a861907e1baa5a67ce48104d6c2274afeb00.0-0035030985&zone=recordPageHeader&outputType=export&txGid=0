The radiative impacts of NOx emissions were dependent on the location chosen for the emission pulse, whether at the surface or in the upper troposphere or whether in the northern or southern hemispheres. Global warming potentials were derived for each of the short-lived tropospheric ozone precursor species by integrating the methane and tropospheric ozone responses over a 100-year time horizon. Indirect radiative forcing due to methane and tropospheric ozone changes appear to be significant for all of the tropospheric ozone precursor species studied. Whereas the radiative forcing from methane changes is likely to be dominated by methane emissions, that from tropospheric ozone changes is controlled by all the tropospheric ozone precursor gases, particulariy NOx emissions. The indirect radiative forcing impacts of tropospheric ozone changes may be large enough such that ozone precursors should be considered in the basket of trace gases through which policy-makers aim to combat global climate change.",,"Carbon monoxide; Global warming; Hydrogen; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Troposphere; Emission pulse; Greenhouse effect; global warming; greenhouse effect; ozone; radiative forcing; troposphere",,,,,,"Atkinson, R., Gas-Phase Tropospheric Chemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) J.
