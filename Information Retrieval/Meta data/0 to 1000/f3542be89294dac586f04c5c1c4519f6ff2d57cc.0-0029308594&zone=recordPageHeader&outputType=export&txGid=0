In this analysis method, the most important factor is exact calculation of the sound speed in water, that is, the sound wave propagation time. However, so far, analysis of SOFAR propagations in the low-latitude sea area has been lacking. Such a sea area is very important for analysis of the El Nin o Current and others, although a special sound speed structure appears in the region of uniform sound speed formed around the SOFAR axis. For SOFAR propagation, we have compared time-domain results using two models, based on the measurement of far-range sound wave propagation in the sea east of Mindanao Island. The models chosen for the analysis are Stickler's normal mode method (SNM) and ray approximations. (The SNM time series is obtained via Fourier synthesis.) By this means we examined the characteristics of wave theory and ray theory in the low-latitude sea area. © 1995 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Low-latitude sea area; Ocean acoustic tomography; Pulse wave; Ray theory; SOFAR; Stickler’s normal mode method; Time-domain analysis","Acoustic imaging; Approximation theory; Boundary conditions; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Global warming; Hydrophones; Mathematical models; Ocean currents; Oceanography; Time domain analysis; Time series analysis; Airy functions; Eigenmode; Fourier synthesis; Hankel function; Ocean acoustic tomography; Pulse wave; Ray approximations; Ray theory; Stickler normal mode method; Wave theory; Acoustic wave propagation",,,,,,"Porter, M., Reiss, E.L., (1984) J.
