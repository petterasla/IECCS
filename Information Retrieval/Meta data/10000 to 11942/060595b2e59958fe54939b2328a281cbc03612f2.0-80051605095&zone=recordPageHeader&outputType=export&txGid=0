Our model yields similar results to those calculated from barotropic models, and also provides a chance to study Rossby waves in the slowly varying flows with both vertical and meridional shears. The model results show that upward Rossby waves can only grow in westerlies, and decay when further ascend. The baroclinic Rossky waves are restrained by the β effect in lower latitude. In the westerly jet with meridional and vertical shears, the barotropic Rossby waves originated from south of the westerly jet, and these can grow while propagating upper-northward. The baroclinic Rossby waves originated from north of the westerly jet and can grow while propagating upward and southward. Such a semi-analytical model provides a simple forecasting tool to allow study of the local weather anomalies to the heating/topography forcing associated with the global warming. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","energy evolution; ray theory; Rossby waves; semi-analytical; slowly varying flow",,,,,,,"Bjerknes, J., A possible response of the atmospheric Hadley circulation to equatorial anomalies of ocean temperature (1966) Tellus, 18, pp. 820-829; Bjerknes, J., Atmospheric teleconnections from the equatorial Pacific (1969) Mon Weather Rev, 97, pp. 163-172; Namias, J., Thermal communication between the sea surface and the lower troposphere (1973) J Phys Oceanogr, 3, pp. 373-378; Namias, J., Negative ocean-air feedback systems over the North Pacific in the transition from warm to cold seasons (1976) Mon Weather Rev, 104, pp. 1107-1121; Horel, J.D., Wallace, J.M., Planetary-scale atmospheric phenomena associated with the Southern Oscillation (1981) Mon Weather Rev, 109, pp. 813-829; Wallace, J.M., Gutzler, D.S., Teleconnections in the geopotential height field during the Northern Hemisphere winter (1981) Mon Weather Rev, 109, pp. 784-812; Hoskins, B.J., Karoly, D.J., The steady linear response of a spherical atmosphere to thermal and orographic forcing (1981) J Atmos Sci, 38, pp. 1179-1196; Webster, P.J., Mechanisms determining the atmospheric response to sea surface temperature anomalies (1981) J Atmos Sci, 38, pp. 554-571; Webster, P.J., Seasonality in the local and remote atmospheric response to sea surface temperature anomalies (1982) J Atmos Sci, 38, pp. 554-571; Hoerling, M.P., Hurrell, J.W., Xu, T., Twentieth century North Atlantic climate change.
