Establishing past rates of climate change from temperature proxy data remains difficult given their limited spatiotemporal resolution. In contrast, past greenhouse gas radiative forcing, causing climate to change, is well known from ice cores. We compare rates of change of anthropogenic forcing with rates of natural greenhouse gas forcing since the Last Glacial Maximum and of solar and volcanic forcing of the last millennium. The smoothing of atmospheric variations by the enclosure process of air into ice is computed with a firn diffusion and enclosure model. The 20th century increase in CO2 and its radiative forcing occurred more than an order of magnitude faster than any sustained change during the past 22,000 years. The average rate of increase in the radiative forcing not just from CO2 but from the combination of CO2, CH4, and N2O is larger during the Industrial Era than during any comparable period of at least the past 16,000 years. In addition, the decadal-to-century scale rate of change in anthropogenic forcing is unusually high in the context of the natural forcing variations (solar and volcanoes) of the past millennium. Our analysis implies that global climate change, which is anthropogenic in origin, is progressing at a speed that is unprecedented at least during the last 22,000 years. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse gas; Ice core","carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; air pollution control; air quality control; anthropology; article; climate change; diffusion; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; ice core record; nonhuman; priority journal; socioeconomics; temperature measurement; volcano; atmosphere; chemistry; climate; human; pollution; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Methane; Nitrous Oxide",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Stauffer, B., (2002) Ann Glaciol, 35, pp. 202-208; Siegenthaler, U., Stable carbon cycle-climate relationship during the late Pleistocene (2005) Science, 310, pp. 1313-1317; Spahni, R., Atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide of the late Pleistocene from Antarctic ice cores (2005) Science, 310, pp. 1317-1321; Forster, P., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
