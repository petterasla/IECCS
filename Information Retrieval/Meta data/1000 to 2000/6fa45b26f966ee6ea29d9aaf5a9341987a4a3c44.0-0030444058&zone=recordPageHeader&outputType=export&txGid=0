The seven species involved (White-eyed Vireo [Vireo griseus], Yellow-throated Vireo [V. flavifrons], Northern Parula [Parula americana], Yellow-throated Warbler [Dendroica dominica], Worm-eating Warbler [Helmitheros vermivorus], Kentucky Warbler [Oporornis formosus], and Hooded Warbler [Wilsonia citrina]) all breed primarily in the southeastern United States, suggesting a common factor for the influx. Furthermore, all seven species have been recorded in California with increasing frequency over the past two decades, suggesting a common trend in the populations of these species. We examined five hypotheses that could explain the increasing number of California records of these species: (1) observer bias, (2) pesticide-caused misorientation, (3) shifts in winter range, (4) anomalous weather conditions (including global warming and El Niño-Southern Oscillation), and (5) range expansions into the western United States and/or dramatic population increases in the southeastern United States. We found little or no support for the first three hypotheses. Anomalous weather conditions probably accounted for the magnitude of the 1992 influx, but the final hypothesis is needed to explain the overall trend. Although available data are not sufficient to distinguish between summer distributional shifts and population increases within the ""normal"" breeding ranges of these species, the possibility of westward range expansion is intriguing.",,,,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., Lewis, T.J., The history of Farallon Island marine bird populations 1854-1972 (1974) Condor, 76, pp. 432-446; Ainley, D.G., Carter, H.R., Anderson, D.W., Briggs, K.T., Coulter, M.C., Cruz, F., Cruz, J.B., Smith, N.G., Effects of the 1982-1983 El Niño-Southern Oscillation on Pacific Ocean bird populations (1988) Acta XIX Congressus Internationalis Ornithologici, pp. 1747-1758. , (H.
