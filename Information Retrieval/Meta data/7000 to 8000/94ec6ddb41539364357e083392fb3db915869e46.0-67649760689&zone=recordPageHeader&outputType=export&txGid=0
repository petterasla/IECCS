These gases need to be removed efficiently because of their strong absorption of infrared radiation and long atmospheric lifetimes which cause the global warming effect. In this study, microwave argon plasma operating at atmospheric pressure was investigated experimentally for various operating conditions including microwave power, total gas flow rate, initial concentration, and additive gas. The mechanisms of perfluorocompounds decomposition were studied by the plasma emission spectrum. Under the optimum condition, the destruction and removal efficiency of CF 4 could reach up to 98.4%. The emission spectrum analysis indicated that the existence of the O or OH radicals could enhance the CF 4 decomposition by adding suitable volume of O 2 or H 2O. The mechanisms of CF 4 decomposition are that the electron, O and OH radicals all associated with CF 4 conversion, it has the sequence that enough effective electrons reacted with CF 4 to form CF i radicals, O and OH radicals further reacted with CF i radicals to convert CF 4 into CO 2 and HF. © 2009.","Emission spectrum; Microwave plasma; Perfluorocomounds; Removal efficiency","Argon plasmas; Atmospheric lifetime; Destruction and removal efficiency; Emission spectrum; Gas flowrate; Initial concentration; Microwave plasma; Microwave power; OH radical; Operating condition; Optimum conditions; Perfluorocomounds; Perfluorocompounds; Plasma emission spectrum; Removal efficiency; Semiconductor industry; Argon; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric pressure; Free radicals; Gas absorption; Gases; Global warming; Inductively coupled plasma; Infrared radiation; Microwaves; Removal; Semiconductor device manufacture; Spectrum analyzers; Emission spectroscopy; perfluoro compound; absorption; atmospheric pressure; decomposition; efficiency measurement; electron; experimental study; fluorocarbon; global warming; hydroxyl radical; plasma; visible spectrum; article; atmospheric pressure; concentration response; decomposition; electron; flow rate; gas flow; microwave radiation; radiation absorption; spectroscopy; Atmospheric Pressure; Fluorocarbons; Microwaves; Oxygen; Semiconductors",,"Fluorocarbons; Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Chang, M.B., Lee, H.M., Abatement of perfluorocarbons with combined plasma catalysis in atmospheric-pressure environment (2004) Catal.
