The Synthesis Report of the IPCC's Third Assessment Report, 2001, uses a ""cause and effect"" approach developed in the integrated assessment literature. This viewpoint reviews this approach and suggests an alternative, based on stocks and flows. The alternative gives a much richer representation of the problem so that it includes the enhanced greenhouse effect, ancillary benefits of mitigation, the distinction between climate-change and other stresses on natural systems, and a more refined distinction between adaptation and mitigation. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.
