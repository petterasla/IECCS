Laboratory studies have indicated that plant oils with antimicrobial activity can be used to control pathogens and odor emissions from cattle and swine wastes. However, these oils are aromatic and may volatilize when applied topically. Our objectives were to evaluate the volatility of thymol from a feedlot surface and the effectiveness of topically applying thyme oil (2.5% thymol), incorporated into corncob granules and added once per week, to control odor emissions and total coliforms in feedlot manure. In the first study, thymol either volatilized or was degraded within 28 d after topical application. In a second study, thyme oil (2.5% thymol) was incorporated into corncobs and applied to pen surfaces weekly. Manure samples from 6 locations in each pen were collected from 3 untreated and 3 thymol-corncob-treated pens (15 × 150 m; fifty 400-kg cattle/pen), 3 times per week for 8 wk. Samples were analyzed for thymol concentration, total VFA, branched-chain VFA, aromatic compounds, and the number of Escherichia coli and total coliform bacteria. Over the 8 wk, with the exception of wk 7, the desired thymol concentration of 15 to 20 μmol/g DM was maintained in the manure. Concentrations of VFA and branched chain-VFA increased over time in untreated and treated pens. However, the rate of VFA accumulation in treated pens (7.5 ± 1.3 μmol·g DM -1·wk-1) was less (P &lt; 0.01) than the rate of accumulation in untreated pens (18.0 ± 2.1 μmol·g DM -1·wk-1). Likewise, the rate of branched-chain VFA accumulation in treated pens (0.31 ± 0.04 μmol·g DM -1-wk-1) was less (P &lt; 0.01) than in untreated pens (0.55 ± 0.06 μmol·g DM-1·wk1). The concentrations of E. coli in treated pens (2.9 ± 1.2 × 10 5 cfu·g DM-1) were 91% less (P &lt; 0.04) than in untreated pens (31.1 ± 4.0 × 105 cfu·g DM -1). Similarly, concentrations of coliforms in treated pens (3.7 ± 1.3 × 105 cfu·g DM-1) were 89% less (P &lt; 0.04) than those of untreated pens (35.3 ± 4.2 × 10 5 cfu·g DM-1). These results indicate that odor emissions and total coliforms can be reduced in feedlot manure with a once per week application of thymol incorporated in a granular form. However, corncobs are bulky, and other granular carriers with a greater carrying capacity for thyme oil should be explored. ©2006 American Society of Animal Science.
