The model pertains to the region of tropical easterly surface winds, where the surface salinity increases poleward from a local salinity minimum near the equator to a subtropical salinity maximum. A fundamental constraint is that the meridional freshwater transports in the atmosphere and the ocean have the same magnitude but opposite directions. A key assumption is that the strength of the meridional overturning cells in the atmosphere and the ocean is proportional and set by the surface layer Ekman transport. It is further assumed that, to the lowest order of approximation, the zonal-mean Ekman transports accomplish the meridional freshwater transports, that is, eddy fluxes and gyre-induced transports are ignored. The model predicts that the salinity variation in the oceanic cell is directly proportional to the specific humidity of the near-surface air, but independent of the meridional mass transport (as long as the atmospheric and oceanic mass transports remain proportional). If the relative humidity of the near-surface air is constant, the salinity variation in the oceanic Hadley cell varies essentially with the surface temperature according to the Clausius-Clapeyron expression for the saturation vapor pressure. Further, the model is compared to observations and a global warming simulation and found to give a leading-order description of the tropical surface salinity range. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Clouds; Global warming; Mass transfer; Moisture; Ocean engineering; Oceanography; Salinity measurement; Tropics; Vapor pressure; Conceptual models; Eddy fluxes; Ekman transports; Freshwater transports; Fundamental constraints; Hadley cells; Mass transports; Meridional overturning cells; Near surfaces; Relative humidities; Salinity distributions; Salinity variations; Saturation vapor pressures; Specific humidities; Surface layers; Surface salinities; Surface salinity distributions; Surface temperatures; Surface winds; Atmospheric humidity; computer simulation; Ekman transport; global warming; Hadley cell; mass transport; meridional circulation; modeling; overturn; relative humidity; salinity; surface temperature; surface wind; vapor pressure",,,,,,"Antonov, J.I., Locarnini, R.A., Boyer, T.P., Mishonov, A.V., Garcia, H.E., Salinity (2006) World Ocean Atlas 2005, NOAA Atlas NESDIS, 2. , 62, 182 pp; Beranger, K., Siefridt, L., Barnier, B., Garrnier, E., Roquet, H., Evaluation of operational ECMWF surface freshwater fluxes over oceans during 1991-1997 (1999) J.
