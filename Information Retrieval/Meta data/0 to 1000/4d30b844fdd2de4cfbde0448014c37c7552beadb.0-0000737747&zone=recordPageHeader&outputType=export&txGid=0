Nitrogen efficiency in tropical rice is low.15N recovery rarely exceeds 30-40% in wetland rice production systems. Ammonia (NH3) volatilization and denitrification are recognized as major nitrogen loss mechanisms in such systems. Information on the relative importance of the two loss processes is available for few sites in Asia. The greatest losses of N are reported to occur when the fertilizer treatment leads to a high concentration of ammoniacal N in the floodwater. Results from the studies using micrometereological technique suggest that ammonia volatilization may be the most important loss process in wetland rice ecosystems. Directly measuring denitrification in the field proved more difficult than measuring NH3 volatilization due to difficulty in distinguishing the main end product of denitrification (N2) against a large background of atmospheric N2. However, the directly measured (N2 + N2O) -15N flux for rice in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines rice fields was less than 1% of the applied N. Green manure incorporation in wetland rice fields reduced N losses from mineral N source due to resulting lower floodwater pH and lower partial pressure of NH3 (pNH3) than that of urea applied alone. At present, the integrated use of green manure and mineral N is receiving much attention in the hope of meeting farmers' desire to reduce cost of production as well as ecological considerations such as increased methane production which contribute to global climate change. Other promising alternative practices for increasing fertilizer N efficiency include improved timing and application methods, particularly through better incorporation of basal N fertilizer without standing water, deep placement, and use of coated fertilizers. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","ammonia volatilization; denitrification; green manuring; integrated N management; methane production; N use efficiency; soil N dynamics",,,,,,,"Barker, R., Herdt, R.W., Rose, B., (1985) The Rice Economy in Asia, , Resources for the Future, Washington DC; Broadbent, F.E., Variables affecting A values as a measure of soil nitrogen availability (1970) Soil Science, 110, pp. 19-23; Broadbent, F.E., Transformations of soil nitrogen (1978) Nitrogen and Rice, pp. 108-118. , International Rice Research Institute, Philippines; Buresh, R.J., De Datta, S.K., Denitrification losses from puddled rice soils in the tropics (1990) Biol Fert Soils, 9, pp. 1-13; Buresh, R.J., De Datta, S.K., Saon, M.I., Phongpan, S., Snitwongse, P., Fagi, A.M., Tejasarwana, R., Dinitrogen and nitrous oxide flux from urea basally applied to puddled rice soils (1991) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 55, pp. 268-273; Buresh, R.J., De Datta, S.K., Nitrogen dynamics and management in rice-legume cropping systems (1991) Adv Agron, 45, pp. 1-59; Buresh, R.J., De Datta, S.K., Padilla, J.L., Saon, M.I., Effects of two urease inhibitors on floodwater ammonia following urea application to lowland rice (1988) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 52, pp. 856-861; Datta, SK, M, De Datta, S.K., (1981) Principles and Practices of Rice Production, , John Wiley and Sons, New York; De Datta, S.K., Availability and management of nitrogen in lowland rice in relation to soil characteristics (1985) Proc.
