Other studies suggest that climate change has already started in the Lake Michigan region. This study uses climate predictions from GCMs and projections of historical climate-change trends to examine the potential effects of climate change on riparian vegetation along the Pere Marquette River in west central Michigan. A model of stream discharge as a function of temperature and precipitation was used to estimate the percent of time that each of 25 plots would be inundated at a field site in the riparian corridor on the river. Four vegetation classes were identified at the field site (Alnus, Open-Viburnum, Fraxinus-Carpinus, and Acer-Tsuga). The stream discharge model was used to calculate the percent of time each plot was inundated at the field site under the different climate scenarios and to predict the distribution of vegetation classes that would be present under climate-change conditions. The results suggest that the areal extent of vegetation classes at the field site may change by up to 27%.","Global climate-change; Michigan; Riparian vegetation","climate change; hydrological modeling; riparian vegetation; United States; Acer; Alnus; Carpinus; Fraxinus; Tsuga; Viburnum",,,,,,"Assel, R.A., Robertson, D.M., Changes in winter air temperatures near Lake Michigan, 1851-1993, as determined from regional lake-ice records (1995) Limnology and Oceanography, 40, pp. 165-176; Auble, G.T., Friedman, J.M., Scott, M.L., Relating riparian vegetation to present and future streamflows (1994) Ecological Applications, 4, pp. 544-554; Bedinger, M.S., Forests and flooding with species reference to the White River and Ouachita River basins, Arkansas (1971) United States Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Open File Report 79-68; Bell, D.T., Johnson, F.L., Ground-water level in the floodplain and adjacent uplands of the Sangamon River (1974) Transactions of the Illinois State Academy of Science, 67, pp. 376-383; Bell, D.T., Del Moral, R., Vegetation gradients in the streamside forest of Hickory Creek, Will County, Illinois (1977) Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, 104, pp. 127-135; Boedeltje, G., Bakker, J.P., Vegetation, soil, hydrology and management in a Drenthian brookland (The Netherlands) (1980) Acta Botanica Neerlandica, 29, pp. 509-522; Carbiener, R., Schnitzler, A., Evolution of major pattern models and processes of alluvial forest of the Rhine in the rift valley (France\Germany) (1990) Vegetatio, 88, pp. 115-129; Coile, T.S., Distribution of forest tree roots in North Carolina Piedmont soils (1937) Journal of Forestry, 35, pp. 247-257; Forman, R.T.T., Gudron, M., (1988) Landscape Ecology, , Wiley, New York, NY, USA; Franz, E.H., Bazzaz, F.A., Simulation of vegetation response to modified hydrologic regimes: A probabilistic model based on niche differentiation in a floodplain forest (1977) Ecology, 58, pp. 176-183; Gleason, H.A., Cronquist, A., (1991) Manual of Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada, Second Edition, , The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, NY, USA; Granneman, N.G., Sharp J.M., Jr., Alluvial hydrogeology of the lower Missouri River valley (1979) Journal of Hydrology, 40, pp. 85-99; Grootjans, A.P., Van Diggelen, T., Wassin, M.J., Wiersinga, W.A., The effects of drainage on groundwater quality and plant species distribution in stream valley meadows (1988) Vegetatio, 75, pp. 37-48; Hansen, J., Hanson, C.S., Yoo, B.H., Recent Great Lakes ice trends (1992) Bull.
