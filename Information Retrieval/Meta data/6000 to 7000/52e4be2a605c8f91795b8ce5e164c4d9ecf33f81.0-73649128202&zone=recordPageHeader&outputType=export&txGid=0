Previously, fenarimol was found to cause endocrine disruption in other crustacean species, via the ecdysteroid system. M. affinis were exposed to elevated temperature and/or fenarimol in soft-bottom microcosms during sexual maturation and mating. Elevated temperature and fenarimol (0.7 mg l-1) acted synergistically and increased the number of females with dead eggs, with a more than 4-fold incidence compared to exposure to one of the stressors (24 vs. <5%). Exposure to both stressors also resulted in a negative intrinsic rate of increase, which might indicate a population decline in the field. Elevated temperature impaired sexual maturation in males and females, lowered the number of fertilized females, reduced fecundity and altered embryogenesis. Exposure to fenarimol resulted in a 40% decrease in ecdysteroid levels in sexually mature males and an increase in heat shock protein 60 expression. Ecdysteroid levels were not affected by temperature in either sex or stage of sexual maturation. Our results suggest that increase in the water temperature due to, e.g., global warming would impair reproduction and possibly increase the sensitivity of M. affinis to toxicants. © Inter-Research 2008.","Endocrine disruption; Fenarimol; HSP60; Monoporeia affinis; Reproduction; Temperature","Amphipoda; Crustacea; Monoporeia affinis",,,,,,"Almroth, B.C., Sturve, J., Berglund, A., Förlin, L., Oxidative damage in eelpout (Zoarces viviparous), measured as protein carbonyls and TBARS, as biomarkers (2005) Aquat Toxicol, 73, pp. 171-180; Bajramovíc, J.J., Bsibsi, M., Geutskens, S.B., Hassankhan, R., Differential expression of stress proteins in human adult astrocytes in response to cytokines (2000) J Neuroimmunol, 106, pp. 14-22. , and others; Cary, T.L., Chandler, G.T., Volz, D.C., Walse, S.S., Ferry, J.L., Phenylpyrazole insecticide fipronil induces male infertility in the estuarine meiobenthic crustacean Amphiascus tenuiremis (2004) Environ Sci Technol, 38, pp. 522-528; Chang, E.S., O'Connor, J.D., Arthropod molting hormones (1979) Methods of Hormone Radioimmunoassay, pp. 797-814. , In: Jaffe BM, Beherman HR (eds), Academic, New York; Cossins, A.R., Bowler, K., (1987) Temperature Biology of Animals, , Chapman & Hall, London; Dalle-Donne, I., Giustarini, D., Colombo, R., Rossu, R., Milzani, A., Protein carbonylation in human diseases (2003) Trends Mol Med, 9, pp. 169-176; del Ramo, J., Días-Mayans, J., Torreblanca, A., Núñes, A., Effects of temperature on the acute toxicity of heavy metals (Cr, Cd and Hg) to the freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Girard) (1987) Bull Environ Contam Toxicol, 38, pp. 736-741; Donner, K.O., Lindstrom, A., Lindstrom, M., Seasonal variation in the vertical migration of Pontoporeia affinis (Crustacea, Amphipoda) (1987) Ann Zool Fenn, 24, pp. 305-313; El Haj, A.J., Tamone, S.L., Peake, M., Sreenivasula, R.P., Chang, E.S., An ecdysteroid-responsive gene in a lobster-a potential crustacean member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (1997) Gene, 201, pp. 127-135; Eriksson Wiklund, A.K., Sundelin, B., Impaired reproduction in the amphipods Monoporeia affinis and Pontoporeia femorata as a result of moderate hypoxia and increased temperature (2001) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 222, pp. 131-141; Feder, M.E., Hoffmann, G.E., Heat-shock proteins, molecular chaperones, and the stress response: Evolutionary and ecological physiology (1999) Annu Rev Physiol, 61, pp. 243-282; Grabarczyk, M., Kopec, S.J., Protective action of vitamin E on the subcellular structures of lymphocytes intoxicated with pesticides in vitro (1992) Mater Med Pol, 24, pp. 237-239; Jacobson, T., Sundelin, B., Reproductive effects of the endocrine disruptor fenarimol on a Baltic amphipod Monoporeia affinis (2006) Environ Toxicol Chem, 25, pp. 1126-1131; Lee, Y.J., Shacter, E., Role of carbohydrates in oxidative modification of fibrinogene and other plasma proteins (1995) Arch Biochem Biophys, 321, pp. 175-181; Levine, R.L., Garland, D., Oliver, C.N., Amici, A., Determination of carbonyl content in oxidatively modified proteins (1990) Methods Enzymol, 186, pp. 464-478. , and others; Lyons, C., Dowling, V., Tedengren, M., Gardestrom, J., Variability of heat shock proteins and glutathione S-transferase in gill and digestive gland of blue mussel Mytilus edilus (2003) Mar Environ Res, 56, pp. 585-597. , and others; Meier, H.E.M., Regional ocean climate simulations with a 3D ice-ocean model for the Baltic Sea.
