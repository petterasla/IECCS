Therefore breeding habitat choice is ultimately important. Studies rarely address the potential fitness pay-offs of alternative natural breeding habitats by experimental translocation. Here we present a new tool to study fitness consequences of free living birds in different habitats. We translocated a migratory passerine, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), to a novel site, where pairs were subjected to a short stay (2-4 days) in a nest box-equipped aviary before being released. We show that it is technically possible to retain birds in the new area for breeding, allowing the study of reproductive consequences of dispersal under natural conditions. The translocation resulted in an extension of the interval between arrival and egg laying of four days, highlighting the importance of having an adequate control group. Clutch size and nestling parameters did not differ significantly between translocated and unmanipulated females, which suggests that the procedure did not affect birds in their reproductive performance later on. This method could be applied broadly in evolutionary and ecological research, e.g., to study the potential fitness benefits and costs for dispersing to more northern latitudes as a way of adapting to climate change. © 2011 Burger, Both.",,"animal experiment; article; bird; breeding success; climate change; clutch size; controlled study; egg laying; female; habitat selection; male; nestling; nonhuman; pied flycatcher; pilot study; population dispersal; reproductive fitness; sexual behavior; species habitat; species translocation; wild species; animal; breeding; ecosystem; physiology; population migration; reproduction; songbird; wild animal; Aves; Ficedula hypoleuca; Passeriformes; Animal Migration; Animals; Animals, Wild; Breeding; Clutch Size; Ecosystem; Female; Male; Oviposition; Passeriformes; Reproduction",,,,,,"Fretwell, S.D., Lucas, H.L., On Territorial Behavior and other Factors Influencing Habitat Distribution in Birds (1970) Acta Biotheoretica, 19, pp. 16-36. , 16-36; Morris, D.W., Toward an ecological synthesis: a case for habitat selection (2003) Oecologia, 136, pp. 1-13; Brower, L., Tinbergen, J.M., Both, C., Bristol, R., Richardson, D.S., Experimental evidence for density-dependent reproduction in a cooperatively breeding passerine (2009) Ecology, 90 (3), pp. 729-741; Jaenike, J., Holt, R.D., Genetic Variation for Habitat Preference - Evidence and Explanations (1991) Am Nat, 137, pp. S67-S90; Partridge, L., Habitat selection in titmice (1974) Nature, 247, pp. 573-574; Doligez, B., Danchin, E., Clobert, J., Public information and breeding habitat selection in a wild bird population (2002) Science, 297 (5584), pp. 1168-1170; Both, C., van Asch, M., Bijlsma, R.G., van den Burg, A.B., Visser, M.E., Climate change and unequal phenological changes across four trophic levels: constraints or adaptations?
