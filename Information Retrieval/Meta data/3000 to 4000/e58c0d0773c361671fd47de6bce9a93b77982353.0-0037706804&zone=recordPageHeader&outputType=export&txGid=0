All the Kyoto Protocol gases, CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated gases, were included. The calculations showed that forcing due to Finnish emissions will increase in the case of all gases except methane by the year 2100. In 1990, radiative forcing due to Finland's emission history of all Kyoto Protocol gases was 3.2 mW/m2, of which 71% was due to carbon dioxide, 17% to methane, and the rest to nitrous oxide, In 1990 the share of fluorinated gases was negligible. The share of methane in radiative forcing is decreasing, whereas the shares of carbon dioxide and of fluorinated gases are increasing and that of nitrous oxide remains nearly constant. The nonlinear features concerning additional concentrations in the atmosphere and radiative forcing due to emissions caused by a single country or activity are also considered. Radiative forcing due to Finnish emissions was assessed with two different approaches, the marginal forcing approach and the averaged forcing approach. The impact of the so-called background scenario, i.e., the scenario for concentration caused by global emissions, was also estimated. The difference between different forcing models at its highest was 40%, and the averaged forcing approach appeared to be the more recommendable. The effect of background concentrations in the studied cases was up to 11%. Hence, the choice of forcing model and background scenario should be given particular attention.","Global Warming; Greenhouse effect; Kyoto Protocol; Marginal forcing approach; Radiative forcing","Carbon dioxide; Fluorine; Gas emissions; Fluorinated gases; Greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; fluorine derivative; methane; nitrous oxide; climate change; estimation method; greenhouse gas; radiative forcing; article; atmosphere; calculation; concentration (parameters); Finland; fluorination; gas analysis; greenhouse gas; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; industry; methodology; theoretical model; Finland; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Finland; Fluorine Compounds; Greenhouse Effect; Industry; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Nitrous Oxide",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Fluorine Compounds; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Aaltonen, J., Palosuo, T., Pipatti, R., Key source identification in the Finnish 1999 greenhouse gas inventory (2001) VTT Energy Reports 34/2001, , Espoo, Finland, 28 pp; Den Elzen, M., Schaeffer, M., Assessment of major uncertainties in calculating regional contributions to climate change (2000) RIVM Report No. 728001012, , National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands, 47 pp; (2001) International Energy Annual 1999, , DOE/EIA-0219(99).
