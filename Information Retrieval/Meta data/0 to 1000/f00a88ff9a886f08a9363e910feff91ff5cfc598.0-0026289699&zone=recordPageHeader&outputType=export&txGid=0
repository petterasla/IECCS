The authors consider expansions of pines in and adjacent to their natural ranges in the Northern Hemisphere and the spread from sites of introduction in the Southern Hemisphere well outside the contemporary range of pines. They consider a neutral hypothesis (with respect to climate or biological interactions as determinants of invasion): invasion simply requires that a species is present in sufficient numbers, with sufficient propagules over sufficient time to invade. They then explore the relative importance of climatic changes, disturbance, competition, herbivory, pathogens, and other agents that might influence pine membership in communities. Environmental stresses created by moisture and temperature appear to exercise primary control on invasibility at xeric and high-elevation sites, respectively, but play a smaller role at intermediate locations. At these sites, range limits are determined principally by interactions between pine seedlings and the resident biota in adjacent communities. Pine invasions are most prevalent where there is limited competition in the regeneration niche and occur more easily in habitats where the dominant growth form is most different from that of pines, namely in grasslands. The disturbance regime in the receiving habitat is important and interacts directly and indirectly with the ""inherent' susceptibility to invasion. Severe disturbances may initiate pine invasions at any latitude, but are essential for reducing the cover of vigorous plant growth (and hence competition in the regeneration niche) in tropical and near-tropical regions. -from Authors",,"biological invasion; climatic change; competition; disturbance; pine; cellular organisms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00030147,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026289699
