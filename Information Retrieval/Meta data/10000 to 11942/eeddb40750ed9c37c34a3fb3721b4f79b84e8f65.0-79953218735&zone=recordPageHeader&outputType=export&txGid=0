The global cloud-layer occurrence frequency, the horizontal and the vertical distributions of cloud-occurrence frequency, the global cloud-top height statistics and their seasonal changes are given for 1 year CALIPSO observations. Opaque cloudlayer statistics are analysed for better understanding the statistics of the clouds observed using CALIPSO. Parts of the results are compared with some results from the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) observations, the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) observations and the global rawinsonde observations, the Aqua MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly cloud-fraction data. The comparisons show that results are in agreement with other observations. Due to the primary advance from the active optical sensing, CALIPSOlidar can offermeasurements of accurate, highly resolved vertical profiles of atmospheric scattering layers. It has advantages in determining the location of optically thin clouds and detecting occurrences of multiple layers. Long-term observations by CALIPSO lidar can provide valuable information for the better understanding of the climate system and global climate change. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,"Atmospheric scattering; CALIPSO; Climate system; Cloud statistics; Cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations; Geoscience laser altimeter systems; Global climate changes; Global clouds; High resolution infrared radiation sounders; Layer distributions; Level 2; Lidar observation; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multiple layers; Optical sensing; Seasonal changes; Vertical distributions; Vertical profile; Aneroid altimeters; Atmospherics; Clouds; Infrared radiation; Optical radar; Radio altimeters; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Statistics; Climate change; CALIPSO; cloud cover; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; vertical profile",,,,,,"Ackerman, S.A., Holz, R.E., Frey, R., Eloranta, E.W., Maddux, B.C., McGill, M., Cloud detection with modis (2008) Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 25, pp. 1073-1086. , Part II: Validation; Anselmo, T., Clifton, R., Hunt, W., Lee, K.P., Murray, T., Powell, K., Rodier, S.D., Winker, D., (2006) Cloud-aerosol LIDAR Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations, , http://www.calipso.larc.nasa.gov/products/CALIPSO_DPC_Rev2_3.pdf, Data Management System and Data Products Catalog, Release 2.3, Document No: PC-SCI-503, Available online at; Bergman, J.W., Salby, M.L., Diurnal variations of cloud cover and their relationship to climatological conditions (1996) Journal of Climate, 9, pp. 2802-2820; Berthier, S., Chazette, P., Pelon, J., Baum, B., Comparison of cloud statistics from spaceborne lidar systems (2008) Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 8, pp. 6965-6977; Dessler, A.E., Palm, S.P., Spinhirne, J.D., Tropical cloud-top height distributions revealed by the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat)/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) (2006) Journal of Geophysical Research, 111, pp. D12215; Endo, N., Cloud statistics over eastern China during GAME-IOP as seen from TRMM TMI (2004) Proceedings of 6th International Study Conference On GEWEX In Asia and GAME, pp. 11-12. , December, Kyoto, Japan.
