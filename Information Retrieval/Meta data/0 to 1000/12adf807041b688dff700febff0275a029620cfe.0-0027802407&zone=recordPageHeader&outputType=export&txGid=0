It is argued that, in a coupled ocean-atmosphere system, thermal changes in the atmospheric state in response to changes in heat flux from the ocean weaken the feedback responsible for the PHC. -from Authors",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; halocline; heat flux; modeling; polar halocline catastrophe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00223670,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027802407
