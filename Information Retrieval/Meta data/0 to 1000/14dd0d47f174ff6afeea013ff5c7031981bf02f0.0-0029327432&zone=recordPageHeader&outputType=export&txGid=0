Capture and utilization of the carbon dioxide by microalgae has emerged as a promising technology to help reduce emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. Microalgae are of particular interest because of their rapid growth rates and tolerance to varying environmental conditions. We are currently conducting experiments on the growth of microalgae exposed to simulated flue gas. This technology is envisioned for open raceway cultivation ponds as a low cost implementation strategy. Coupling the production of fuel or commodity chemicals with the use of flue gas carbon dioxide as a microalgal nutrient is envisioned to be a cost-effective method of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide contributed to the atmosphere by fossil fuel-fired power plants. © 1995.","carbon dioxide; fossil fuel combustion; microalgae; NOx; SOx","Air pollution control; Algae; Combustion; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Photosynthesis; Sulfur compounds; Microalgae; Sulfur oxides; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"C.R.
