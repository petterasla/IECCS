Recently, the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and global warming concerns render the renewable energy resources as major solutions for the global energy problem. Our study focuses on solar energy and its application to tunnel illumination. One of the longest tunnels in Turkey is considered for the analysis, and three alternative systems are proposed for replacing the current system in the tunnel that uses the grid power. A detailed cost and feasibility analysis is performed for the alternatives, taking into account the time value of money in an inflationary economy. Net present worth, payback period and internal rate of return calculations are used for analytical purposes. The environmental viability is assessed via the computation of resulting reduction in CO 2 emissions by the proposed systems. Results indicate that the proposed systems are more advantageous than the existing one. © Sila Science.","Economic analysis; Environmental analysis; Light emitting diode (LED); Photovoltaic illumination systems;
