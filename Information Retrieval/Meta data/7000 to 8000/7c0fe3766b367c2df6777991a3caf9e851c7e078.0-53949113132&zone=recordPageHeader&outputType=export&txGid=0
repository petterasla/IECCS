Firstly, land surface temperature (LST) and land surface broadband albedo are retrieved by the split-window algorithms and high-order polynomial regression method, respectively, using NOAA/AVHRR series images. Then, moisture index and thermal index, indicators of climate and moisture conditions in the study area, are computed from meteorological data and LST using principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, long-term dynamics of these eco-environmental factors and the reasons responsible for these changes are analyzed further. The results show that during the years from 1981 to 2000, the study area experienced a gradual increase in annual NDVI and climate factors and a decrease in surface annual broadband albedo, which indicates that the coastal thermal and moisture conditions and the subsistence conditions of natural vegetation have changed to a considerable extent. According to the results, a warming and wetting tendency over the last two decades is obvious in the China's coastal zone that are mainly due to land use changes as of growing urbanization, exhaust emissions from industries and transportations and, partly global climate change. Uncontrolled rapid development of the study area may be blamed for these negative changes as a major driving force. The positive feedback mechanisms between albedo, NDVI and climate factors also partly explain these changes. This study suggests that the method integrating biophysical parameters retrieved from remote sensed images and meteorologic data provides a novel and feasible way to monitor large scale eco-environmental changes. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Change analysis; Coastal China; Eco-environmental monitoring; Quantitative remote sensing","Atmospheric temperature; Behavioral research; Climate control; Climatology; Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Control theory; Dynamics; Feedback; Image enhancement; Land use; Moisture; Principal component analysis; Remote sensing; Sensors; Solar radiation; Space optics; Space time adaptive processing; Surface measurement; Telecommunication systems; Vegetation; Change analysis; Coastal China; Eco-environmental monitoring; Quantitative remote sensing; Climate change; albedo; AVHRR; biophysics; climate change; coastal zone; environmental monitoring; exhaust emission; land surface; land use change; nature-society relations; NDVI; NOAA satellite; principal component analysis; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; surface temperature; temporal variation; urbanization; vegetation dynamics; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,,,,,"Abdul-Wahab, S.A., Bakheit, C.S., Al-Alawi, S.M., Principal component and multiple regression analysis in modelling of ground-level ozone and factors affecting its concentrations (2005) Environ Model Softw, 20, pp. 1263-1271; Allen, S.J., Wallace, J.S., Gash, J.H.C., Sivakumar, M.V.K., Measurements of albedo variation over natural vegetation in the Sahel (1994) Int J Climatol, 14, pp. 625-636; Anyamba, A., Eastman, J.R., Interannual variability of NDVI over Africa and its relation to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (1996) Int J Remote Sens, 17, pp. 2533-2548. , 13; Baran, E., Hanbrey, J., Mangrove conservation and coastal management in Southeast Asia: What impact our fishery resource (1998) Mar Pollut Bull, 37, pp. 431-440. , 8-12; Becker, F., Li, Z., Towards a local split-window method over land surfaces (1990) Int J Remote Sens, 11, pp. 369-393. , 3; Chen, S.S., Chen, L.F., Liu, Q.H., Remote sensing and GIS-based integrated analysis of coastal changes and their environmental impacts in Lingding Bay, Pearl River Estuary, South China (2005) Ocean Coast Manag, 48, pp. 65-83; Colman, A.W., Davey, M.K., Statistical prediction of global sea-surface temperature anomalies (2003) Int J Climatol, 23, pp. 1677-1697; Csiszar, I., Gutman, G., Mapping global land surface albedo from NOAA AVHRR (1999) J Geophys Res, 104, pp. 6215-6228; Dessay, N., Laurent, H., MacHado, L.A.T., Comparative study of the 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 El Nino events over different types of vegetation in South America (2004) Int J Remote Sens, 25, pp. 4063-4077. , 20; English, S., Wilkinson, C., Baker, V., (1997) Survey Manual for Tropical Marine Resource, pp. 119-196. , Australian Institute of Marine Science Townsville; Fang, J., Piao, S., He, J., Increasing terrestrial vegetation activity in China, 1982-1999 (2004) Sci China Ser.
