L7R 4A6, Canada","Following the introduction of hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) gases as replacements for the ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), it has been discovered that HCFCs/HFCs can degrade in the atmosphere to produce trifluoroacetic acid1, a compound with no known loss mechanisms in the environment2,3, and higher concentrations in natural waters4 have been shown to be mildly phytotoxic5. Present environmental levels of trifluooracetic acid are not accounted by HCFC/HFC degradation alone8-10. Here we report that thermolysis of fluorinated polymers, such as the commercial polymers Teflon and KeI-F, can also produce trifluoroacetate and the similar compound chlorodifluoroacetate. This can occur either directly, or indirectly via products that are known to degrade to these haloacetates in the atmosphere11. The environmental significance of these findings is confirmed by modelling, which indicates that the thermolysis of fluoropolymers in industrial and consumer high-temperature applications (ovens, non-stick cooking utensils and combustion engines) is likely to be a significant source of trifluoroacetate in urban rain water (∼25 ng1-1, as estimated for Toronto). Thermolysis also leads to longer chain polyfluoro- and/or polychlorofluoro- (C3-C14) carboxylic acids which may be equally persistent. Some of these products have recently been linked with possible adverse health6 and environmental impacts and are being phased out of the US market7. Furthermore, we detected CFCs and fluorocarbons - groups that can destroy ozone and act as greenhouse gases, respectively - among the other thermal degradation products, suggesting that continued use of fluoropolymers may also exacerbate stratospheric ozone-depletion and global warming.",,"Degradation; Fluorocarbons; Global warming; Halogenation; High temperature applications; Ozone; Thermolysis; Fluorine containing polymers; carboxylic acid; chlorofluorocarbon; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; fluorinated hydrocarbon; organohalogen derivative; polymer; atmospheric chemistry; CFC; global warming; hydrochlorofluorocarbon; hydrofluorocarbon; ozone; air pollutant; air pollution; article; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; greenhouse effect; high temperature; ozone layer; priority journal; Acids; Air Pollutants; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Ozone; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Temperature; Trifluoroacetic Acid",,"Acids; Air Pollutants; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Ozone, 10028-15-6; Polytetrafluoroethylene, 9002-84-0; Trifluoroacetic Acid, 76-05-1",,,,"Franklin, J., The atmospheric degradation and impact of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (hydrofluorocarbon, 134a) (1993) Chemosphere, 27, pp. 1565-1601; Martin, J.W., Detection of chlorodifluoroacetic acid in North American precipitation and surface waters; a possible product of fluorocarbon degradation (2000) Environ.
