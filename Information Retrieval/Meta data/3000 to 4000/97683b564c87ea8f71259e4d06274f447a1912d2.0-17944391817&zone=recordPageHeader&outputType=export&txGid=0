High CO2 emissions emitted into the atmosphere by combustion of fossil fuels cause global warming. Result of combustion of fossil fuels used for heating buildings, air pollution occurs much more in cold cities like Erzurum. Erzurum is one of the coldest cities of Turkey. Low quality fuel consumption together with the increasing energy demands for space heating have caused very high air pollution and poor air quality on occasion during heating period in Erzurum. Thus, in this work, we investigated environmental impact of heat insulation used for reduction heat losses in building. In this analysis, it has been determined that CO2 emissions amount decreased 50% by means of optimum insulation thickness used and other energy savings methods in buildings. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
