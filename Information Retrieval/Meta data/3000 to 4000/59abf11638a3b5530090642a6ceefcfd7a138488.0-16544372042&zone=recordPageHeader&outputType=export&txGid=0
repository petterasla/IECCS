Measurements are conducted from January to December 2002 during a year. Mean methane flux from different exposed areas of a biogas plant of 3 m3 capacity are: (i) Inlet/outlet pipes; 70 g/m2/d, (ii) Around gasholder; 87 g/m2/d, and (iii) Slurry tank; 41 g/m2/d, and increased by 15-20 per cent with the increase in plant capacity to 85 m3. Seasonal variation of slurry temperature strongly affects the methane emission. Emission rates during the summer are found to be high (125, 179, 230 and 230 g/m2/d, respectively, from the holder side of 3, 6, 9, and 85 m3) at slurry temperatures near optimum mesophilic range (32°C during June) and drop down considerably (68 to 79 per cent) during winter at slurry temperatures in the lower psychrophilic range (13°C in December). The correlation coefficient between the CH4 flux and the slurry temperature is found to be positive (between 0.90 and 0.96) and significant.","Biogas plant; Floating gasholder; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane losses; Slurry pit","biofuel; global warming; industrial application; methane emission; methane gas holder; slurry; Bos taurus",,,,,,"Bouwman, A.F., (1991) Biogeochemistry, 15, p. 65; Cicerone, R.J., Oremland, R.S., (1988) Global Biogeochem, 2, p. 299; Khalil, M.A.K., Shearer, M.J., (1993) Chemosphere, 26, p. 201; (1996) Climate Change 1995.
