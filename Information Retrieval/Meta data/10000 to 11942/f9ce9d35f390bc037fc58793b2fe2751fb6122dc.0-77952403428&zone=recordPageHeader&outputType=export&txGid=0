Within the debate about mitigating global climate change, there is mounting pressure for emerging economies like China to take more responsibility for reducing their carbon emissions within a post-2012 international climate change policy framework. For China, this leads to fundamental questions about how feasible it is for the country to shift away from its recent carbon intensive pattern of growth. This paper presents some general results of scenarios that have been developed to investigate how China might continue to develop within a cumulative carbon emissions budget. The results show how changes in the key sectors of the Chinese economy could enable China to follow four different low carbon development pathways, each of which complies with a cumulative emissions constraint. Each scenario reflects different priorities for governmental decision making, infrastructure investments and social preferences. Having compared the key features of each scenario, the paper concludes with some implications for Chinese government policy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cumulative emissions; Low carbon transition; Scenario analysis","Carbon emissions; Chinese economy; Chinese Government; Climate change policies; Emerging economies; Global climate changes; Growing demand; Infrastructure investment; Key feature; Low carbon; Scenario analysis; Social preference; Transition scenarios; Decision making; Economics; Investments; Climate change; carbon budget; carbon emission; decision making; emission control; environmental policy; infrastructural development; state role; twenty first century; China",,,,,,"Anderson, K., Bows, A., From long-term targets to cumulative emission pathways: reframing UK climate policy.
