Comparisons were made between plants growing in an atmosphere naturally enriched with CO2 (≃ 790 μmol mol-1) near the CO2 spring and plants of the same species growing in adjacent areas exposed to ambient CO2 concentrations (≃ 360 μmol mol-1). Nardus stricta growing near the spring exhibited earlier senescence and reductions in photosynthetic capacity (≃25%), Rubisco content (≃26%), Rubisco activity (≃40%), Rubisco activation state (≃23%), chlorophyll content (≃33%) and leaf area index (≃22%) compared with plants growing away from the spring. The potential positive effects of elevated [CO2] on grassland ecosystems in Iceland are likely to be reduced by strong down-regulation in the photosynthetic apparatus of the abundant N. stricta species.","Arctic; Biochemistry; CO2 springs; Elevated CO2; Global climate change; Growth; Iceland; Nardus stricta; Natural vegetation; Phenology; Photosynthesis","Nardus stricta",,,,,,"Acock, B., Allen Jr., H.A., Crop responses to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations (1985) Direct Effects of Increasing Carbon Dioxide on Vegetation, pp. 53-97. , (eds B.R.
