Physical environment responses to warming have been reported, but not details of large-area temperate growing season impacts, or consequences for ecosystems and agriculture. To date, hemispheric-scale measurements of biospheric changes have been confined to remote sensing. However, these studies did not provide detailed data needed for many investigations. Here, we show that a suite of modeled and derived measures (produced from daily maximum-minimum temperatures) linking plant development (phenology) with its basic climatic drivers provide a reliable and spatially extensive method for monitoring general impacts of global warming on the start of the growing season. Results are consistent with prior smaller area studies, confirming a nearly universal quicker onset of early spring warmth (spring indices (SI) first leaf date, -1.2 days decade-1 late spring warmth (SI first bloom date, -1.0 days decade-1 last spring day below 5°C, -1.4 days decade-1), and last spring freeze date (-1.5 days decade-1) across most temperate NH land regions over the 1955-2002 period. However, dynamics differ among major continental areas with North American first leaf and last freeze date changes displaying a complex spatial relationship. Europe presents a spatial pattern of change, with western continental areas showing last freeze dates getting earlier faster, some central areas having last freeze and first leaf dates progressing at about the same pace, while in portions of Northern and Eastern Europe first leaf dates are getting earlier faster than last freeze dates. Across East Asia last freeze dates are getting earlier faster than first leaf dates. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Freeze dates; Global warming; Growing season; Northern Hemisphere; Phenology; Spring","climate change; global warming; growing season; Northern Hemisphere; phenology; spring (season)",,,,,,"Ahas, R., Aasa, A., Menzel, A., Changes in European spring phenology (2002) International Journal of Climatology, 22, pp. 1727-1738; Badeck, F.W., Bondeau, A., Böttcher, K., Responses of spring phenology to climate change (2004) New Phytologist, 162, pp. 295-309; Bonsol, B.R., Zhang, X., Vincent, L.A., Characteristics of daily and extreme temperatures over Canada (2001) Journal of Climate, 14, pp. 1959-1976; Cayan, D.R., Kammerdiener, S.A., Dettinger, M.D., Changes in the onset of spring in the western United States (2001) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 82, pp. 399-415; Chmielewski, F.M., Rötzer, T., Annual and spatial variability of the beginning of growing season in Europe in relation to temperature changes (2002) Climate Research, 19, pp. 257-264; Chuine, I., Beaubien, E., Phenology is a major determinant of tree species range (2001) Ecology Letters, 4, pp. 500-510; Easterling, D.R., Recent changes in frost days and the frost-free season in the United States (2002) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 83, pp. 1327-1332; Feng, S., Hu, Q., Changes in agro-meteorological indicators in the contiguous United States: 1951-2000 (2004) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 78, pp. 247-264; Frich, P., Alexander, L.V., Della-Marta, P., Observed coherent changes in climatic extremes during the second half of the twentieth century (2002) Climate Research, 19, pp. 193-212; Fitzjarrald, D.R., Acevedo, O.C., Moore, K.E., Climatic consequences of leaf presence in the eastern United States (2001) Journal of Climate, 14, pp. 598-614; Heino, R., Brázdil, R., Førland, E., Progress in the study of climatic extremes in northern and central Europe (1999) Climatic Change, 42, pp. 151-181; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report (eds Houghton JT, Ding Y, Griggs DJ et al.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Jaagus, J., Ahas, R., Space-time variations of climatic seasons and their correlation with the phenological development of nature in Estonia (2000) Climate Research, 15, pp. 207-219; Jones, P.D., Moberg, A., Hemispheric and large-scale surface air temperatures: An extensive revision and an update to 2001 (2003) Journal of Climate, 16, pp. 206-223; Kiktev, D., Sexton, D.M.H., Alexander, L., Comparison of modeled and observed trends in indices of daily climate extremes (2003) Journal of Climate, 16, pp. 3560-3571; Klein Tank, A.M.G., Wijnggaard, J.B., Können, G.P., Daily dataset of 20th-century surface air temperature and precipitation series for the European climate assessment (2002) International Journal of Climatology, 22, pp. 1441-1453; Kunkel, K.E., Easterling, D.R., Hubbard, K., Temporal variations in frost-free season in the United States: 1895-2000 (2004) Geophysical Research Letters, 31. , art. no.
