Ideally this problem will be overcome by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Various space-based methods, including large-scale solar shades, diffusers or atmospheric pollutants, have been considered to reduce the solar constant (input flux) and the warming in case emissions reductions are not achieved in a timely way. Here it is pointed out that proposed technologies for near-Earth orbiting comet deflection, suggest a different kind of space-based solar shade. This shade would be made up of micron-sized dust particles derived from comet fragments or lunar mining, and positioned in orbits near the triangular Lagrange points of the Earth-Moon system. Solar radiation pressure can render such orbits unstable, but a class of nearly resonant, and long-lived orbits is shown to exist, though the phase space volume of such orbits depends on dust grain size. Advantages and disadvantages of this scheme relative to others are considered.","Global warming; NEO comets; Restricted N-body problem; Solar shades","Anthropogenic global warming; Atmospheric pollutants; Emissions reduction; N body problem; NEO comets; Phase-space volume; Solar radiation pressure; Solar shades; Earth (planet); Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Moon; Phase space methods; Solar radiation; Sun; Orbits",,,,,,"(2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC, eds.
