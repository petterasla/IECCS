The Australian population is particularly focused along the coastline, especially in metropolitan centres; however, the population of regional centres along the coast is increasing steadily in response to a phenomenon termed seachange. Coastal systems are increasingly threatened by potential impacts as a result of climate change, as indicated by the successive assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although Australia played a central role in applying a common methodology (CM), developed from IPCC guidelines in the 1990s, and in devising alternative approaches, which were initially trialled at nine sites on the Australian coast, there has not been a nationally co-ordinated approach to assessing the coastal vulnerability of Australia, and such an approach is only emerging now. Instead, there have been a series of different approaches adopted to look at the different parts of the Australian coast, including wetland mapping in northern Australia; geomorphic unit mapping in South Australia; storm surge vulnerability modelling in Queensland; probabilistic approaches to beach erosion in New South Wales; indicative mapping of potential coastal retreat in Tasmania. Additionally, there have been methods proposed by insurers and coastal engineers to meet their requirements. Since 2005, the Australian government has once again seen the need for a national coastal vulnerability assessment, and a series of studies are planned or under way to achieve the aims of a National Climate Change Adaptation Framework. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2008.","Australia; Coast; Global climate change; Sea-level rise; Vulnerability assessment",,,,,,,"Abuodha, P.A., Woodroffe, C.D., (2006) International Assessments of the Vulnerability of the Coastal Zone to Climate Change, Including an Australian Perspective, , http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/impacts/publications/pubs/ coastal-international.pdf, Prepared for the Australian Greenhouse Office, Department of Environment and Heritage; (2005) Climate Change Risk and Vulnerability: Promoting an Efficient Adaptation Response in Australia, , Allen Consulting Group Report to the Australian Greenhouse Office, Canberra; (2006) Year Book Australia, 2006, , http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@nsf/Latestproducts/ BE2857976E4D24EACA2570DE000314A3?opendocument, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Accessed 29 Aug 2007; Bayliss, B.L., Brennan, K.G., Eliot, I., Finlayson, C.M., Hall, R.N., House, T., Pidgeon, R.W.J., Waterman, P., Vulnerability assessment of predicted climate change and sea level rise in the Alligator Rivers Region, Northern Territory, Australia (1998) Supervising Scientist Report 123, , Supervising Scientist, Canberra; Bryan, B., Harvey, N., Belperio, A., Bourman, B., Distributed process modeling for regional assessment of coastal vulnerability to sea-level rise (2001) Environ Model Assess, 6, pp. 57-65; Burnley, I., Murphy, P., (2004) Sea Change: Movement from Metropolitan to Arcadian Australia, , UNSW Press, Sydney; Chen, K., McAneney, J., High resolution estimates of Australia's coastal population (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L16601. , doi: 10.1029/2006GL026981; Church, J.A., Hunter, J.R., McInnes, K.L., White, N.J., Sea-level rise around the Australian coastline and the changing frequency of extreme sea-level events (2006) Aust Meteorol Mag, 55, pp. 253-260; Cobb, S.M., Saynor, M.J., Eliot, M., Eliot, I., Hall, R.N., Saltwater intrusion and mangrove encroachment of coastal wetlands in the Alligator Rivers Region, Northern Territory, Australia (2007) Supervising Scientist Report 191, , Supervising Scientist, Canberra; Cooper, J.A.G., Pilkey, O.H., Sea-level rise and shoreline retreat: Time to abandon the Bruun Rule (2004) Glob Planet Change, 43, pp. 157-171; Cowell, P.J., Zeng, T.Q., Integrating uncertainty theory with GIS for modelling coastal hazards of climate change (2003) Mar Geol, 26, pp. 1-14; Cowell, P.J., Thom, B.G., Jones, R.A., Everts, C.H., Simanovic, D., Management of uncertainty in predicting climate-change impacts on beaches (2006) J Coast Res, 22, pp. 232-245; Crimp, S., Balston, J., Ash, A., (2004) Climate Change in the Cairns and Great Barrier Reef Region: Scope and Focus for an Integrated Assessment, , Australian Greenhouse Office, Canberra; (1995) Living on the Coast, the Commonwealth Coastal Policy, , Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories (DEST) Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra; (1996) Australian Coastal Vulnerability Assessment Project Report, , Department of the Environment, Sport, Territories (DEST) Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra; Eliot, I., Finlayson, C.M., Waterman, P., Predicted climate change, sea-level rise and wetland management in the Australian wet-dry tropics (1999) Wetl Ecol Manag, 7, pp. 63-81; Eliot, I., Saynor, M., Eliot, M., Finlayson, C.M., Assessment and monitoring of coastal change in the Alligator Rivers Region, northern Australia (2000) Supervising Scientist Report 157, , Supervising Scientist, Canberra; Eliot, I., Saynor, M.J., Eliot, M., Pfitzner, K., Waterman, P., Woodward, E., (2005) Assessment and Development of Tools for Assessing the Vulnerability of Wetlands and Rivers to Climate Change in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, , Report prepared by the Environment Research Institute of the Supervising Scientist and the National Centre for Tropical Wetland Research for the Australian Greenhouse Office, Canberra; Finlayson, C.M., Eliot, I., Ecological assessment and monitoring of coastal wetlands in Australia's wet-dry tropics: A paradigm for elsewhere?
