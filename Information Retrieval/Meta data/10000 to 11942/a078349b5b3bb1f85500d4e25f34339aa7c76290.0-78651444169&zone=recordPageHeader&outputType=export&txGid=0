Global warming has the potential to increase hurricane flooding, both by hurricane intensification and by sea level rise. In this paper, the impact of hurricane intensification and sea level rise are evaluated using hydrodynamic surge models and by considering the future climate projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For the Corpus Christi, Texas, United States study region, mean projections indicate hurricane flood elevation (meteorologically generated storm surge plus sea level rise) will, on average, rise by 0.3 m by the 2030s and by 0.8 m by the 2080s. For catastrophic-type hurricane surge events, flood elevations are projected to rise by as much as 0.5 m and 1.8 m by the 2030s and 2080s, respectively. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Coastal flooding; Corpus christi; Flood elevations; Future climate; Hurricane intensification; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Potential impacts; Sea level rise; Storm surges; Tropical cyclone; Climate models; Global warming; Sea level; Storms; Hurricanes; climate prediction; flooding; global warming; hurricane; hydrodynamics; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; sea level change; storm surge; Corpus Christi; Texas; United States",,,,,,"Ali, A., Vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges (1996) J Water Air Soil Pollut, 92, pp. 171-179; Ali, A., Impacts and adaptation assessment in Bangladesh (1999) Clim Res, 12, pp. 109-116; Blake, E.S., Rappaport, E.N., Jarrell, J.D., The deadliest, costliest, and most intense United States tropical cyclones from 1851 to 2005 (and other frequently requested hurricane facts) (2006) National Weather Service NWS TPC, p. 4; Cañizares, R., Irish, J.L., Simulation of storm-induced barrier-island morphodynamics and flooding (2008) Coast Eng, 55, pp. 1089-1101; Cayan, D.R., Bromirski, P.D., Hayhoe, K., Climate change projections of sea level extremes along the California coast (2008) Clim Change, 87, pp. 57-73; Church, J.A., White, N.J., A 20th century acceleration in global sea-level rise (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, p. 01602; Danard, M., Munro, A., Murty, T., Storm surge hazard in Canada (2003) Nat Hazards, 28, pp. 407-431; Dean, R.G., Bender, C.J., Static wave setup with emphasis on damping effects by vegetation and bottom friction (2006) Coast Eng, 53, pp. 149-156; Demernard, J., Sætra, O., Røed, L.P., Future wind, wave and storm surge climate in the northern North Atlantic (2002) Clim Res, 23, pp. 39-49; Elsner, J.B., Kossin, J.P., Jagger, T.H., The increasing intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 92-95; Emanuel, K.A., Živković-Rothman, M., Development and evaluation of a convection scheme for use in climate models (1999) J Atmos Sci, 56, pp. 1766-1782; Emanuel, K.A., Sundararajan, R., Williams, J., Hurricanes and global warming: results from downscaling IPCC AR3 simulations (2008) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 89, pp. 347-367; (2008) Hurricane Ike Storm Surge.
