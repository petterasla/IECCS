Acclimation was tested through acute measurements of upper lethal limit and a modified measure of tenacity, that tested muscle capacity by measuring the length of time that N. concinna were able to remain attached to the substratum at different temperatures. Both measures acclimated in response to incubation to the higher temperature. Lethal limits were elevated in N. concinna incubated at 2.9°C (8.1 ± 0.3 °C) compared to those incubated at - 0.3°C (6.9 ± 0.4°C). 2.9°C incubated N. concinna also had a maximum tenacity at 2.1°C, a higher temperature than the maximum tenacity of those incubated at - 0.3°C, which occurred at - 1.0°C. This study is the first to show that the Antarctic limpet can acclimate its physiology, but that it requires a greater period of time for acclimation to occur than previous studies have allowed for. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Acclimation; Antarctic limpet; Nacella concinna; Tenacity; Thermal window","acclimation; ectothermy; muscle; physiological response; snail; substrate; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; West Antarctica; Nacella concinna",,,,,,"Branch, G.M., The biology of limpets: physical factors, energy flow, and ecological interactions (1981) Oceanogr.
