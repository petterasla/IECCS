Not only is this extremely wasteful but rotting food produces gases that are harmful to the environment and contributes to global warming. The UK government is committed to reducing the amount of household waste directly being disposed of at landfills by 10.1 million tonnes tonnes over 20 years from 2000 (Waste Composition Analysis: Guidance for Local Authorities, Defra, 2004). As part of this the Waste Reduction Action Programme was set up to fund and facilitate innovative solutions to reduce waste to landfill. Part of that process was to assess bids by solution providers with regards the effectiveness of the technologies that they were offering. This was found to be a non-trivial task, with multiple input parameters and large variations in data. Establishing which parameters have the greatest effect on food waste estimation was therefore essential in any decision-making process. However, the large number of unknowns, assumptions and parameters makes this understanding both difficult and time consuming. A branch of mathematics known as uncertainty analysis can be used to analyse these types of situations quickly and effectively and is easily adapted to understanding of food waste estimation. This paper outlines the techniques used to develop an internet-based decision-making tool and demonstrates the methodology used with simple case studies. © ISWA 2009.","Decision analysis; Food waste; Uncertainty analysis; Wmr 1379-5","Decision analysis; Decision making process; Environmental issues; Food waste; Government IS; Household waste; Innovative solutions; Internet based; Local authorities; Multiple inputs; Non-trivial tasks; Solution providers; Techniques used; Waste composition; Waste reduction; Wmr 1379-5; Cellular radio systems; Decision making; Decision theory; Estimation; Global warming; Land fill; Waste disposal; Uncertainty analysis; decision analysis; decision making; environmental issue; estimation method; landfill; uncertainty analysis; waste disposal; waste management; article; decision making; food; fuzzy system; human; Internet; landfill; mathematical computing; methodology; priority journal; solid waste management; uncertainty; waste disposal; waste management; waste minimization; Environmental Monitoring; Food; Internet; Models, Theoretical; Software; Uncertainty; Waste Management; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,"Comba, J.L.D., Stolfi, J., Affine Arithmetic and its applications to computer graphics (1993) Proc. of the VI Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing (SIBGRAPI) '93, pp. 9-18. , In: Recife, Brazil; (1999) National Food Survey, , Defra (Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) (ed.)
