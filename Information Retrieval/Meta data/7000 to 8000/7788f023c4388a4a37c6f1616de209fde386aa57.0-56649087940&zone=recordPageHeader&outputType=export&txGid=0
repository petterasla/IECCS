Using histological techniques or PCR assays, we detected chytrid infection in 10 species of aquatic-breeding amphibians in 6 states. The prevalence of chytrid infection was 17.8% for samples of postmetamorphic amphibians examined using skin swab-PCR assays (n = 202 samples from 12 species at 4 sites). In this subset of samples, anurans had a much higher prevalence of infection than caudates (39.2% vs. 5.5%, respectively). Mean prevalence in ranid frogs was 40.7 %. The only infected salamanders were Notophthalmus viridescens at 3 sites. We found infected amphibians from late winter through late spring and in 1 autumn sample. Although we encountered moribund or dead amphibians at 9 sites, most mortality events were not attributed to Bd. Chytridiomycosis was established as the probable cause of illness or death in fewer than 10 individuals. Our observations suggest a pattern of widespread and subclinical infections. However, because most of the sites in our study were visited only once, we cannot dismiss the possibility that chytridiomycosis is adversely affecting some populations. Furthermore, although there is no evidence of chytrid-associated declines in our region, the presence of this pathogen is cause for concern given global climate change and other stressors. Although presence-absence surveys may still be needed for some taxa, such as bufonids, we recommend that future researchers focus on potential population-level effects at sites where Bd is now known to occur. © Inter-Research 2008.","Acris; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycosis; Geographic distribution; Notophthahnus; Pseudacns; Rana","amphibian; bioassay; fungal disease; fungus; histology; mortality; polymerase chain reaction; Amphibia; animal; animal disease; article; Chytridiomycetes; isolation and purification; microbiology; mycosis; United States; Amphibians; Animals; Chytridiomycota; Mycoses; Southeastern United States; North America; United States; Acris; Amphibia; Anura; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bufonidae; Fungi; Notophthalmus viridescens; Ranidae; Salamandridae; Salamandroidea",,,,,,"Annis, S.L., Dastoor, F.P., Ziel, H., Daszak, P., Longcore, J.E., A DNA-based assay identifies Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in amphibians (2004) J Wildl Dis, 40, pp. 420-428; Berger, L., Speare, R., Daszak, P., Green, D.E., and others, Chytridiomycosis causes amphibian mortality associated with population declines in the rainforests of Australia and Central America (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95, pp. 9031-9036; Berger, L., Marantelli, G., Skerratt, L.F., Speare, R., Virulence of the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis varies with the strain (2005) Dis Aquat Org, 68, pp. 47-50; Bosch, J., Carrascal, L.M., Duran, L., Walker, S., Fisher, M.C., Climate change and outbreaks of amphibian chytridiomycosis in a montane area of Central Spain; is there a link?
