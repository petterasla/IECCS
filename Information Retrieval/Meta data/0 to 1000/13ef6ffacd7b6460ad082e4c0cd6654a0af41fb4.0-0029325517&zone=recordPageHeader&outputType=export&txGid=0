If antropogenic climate change emerge as a major and global driving force, the likelihood for CO2-sequestration (for electricity and hydrogen production) to take a share of the energy market is quite high. Catastrophic scenarios based on the whole fossil fuel reserve being burned and emitted to the atmosphere is not realistic. © 1995.",,"Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Global warming; Technological forecasting; Waste disposal; Anthropogenic climate change; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Fossil fuels",,,,,,,"Kaarstad, O.",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
