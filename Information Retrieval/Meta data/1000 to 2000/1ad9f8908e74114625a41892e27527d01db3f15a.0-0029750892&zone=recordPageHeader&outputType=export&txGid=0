A framework for ecologically based human health risk assessment helps distinguish the concepts of global climate change risk assessment from conventional risk assessment. Specific methods for linking climate variables with human disease include historical analysis of climate and disease data and the development of integrated mathematical models. Two historical climate-disease studies of malaria in Africa provide a starting point for further analysis. -from Authors",,"climatic change; global perspective; health risk; methodological approach; Africa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029750892
