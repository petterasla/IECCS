Much of this energy will come from fossil fuel, a finite resource, which moreover generates carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming. The incentive to develop other, renewable forms of energy is therefore strong, but how can we be sure that our expectations for the future form a rational basis for determining energy policy? The scenario planning technique does not attempt to predict the future, but offers a variety of visions against which current actions and policies can be tested. To guide the move towards a more sustainable future it is also important to be able to monitor our progress. The use of sustainability metrics, tailored to a particular purpose, and relating to resource efficiency, environmental protection, economic benefits and social development, is a way of quantifying this progress. The set of indicators illustrates the 'sustainability footprint' of an enterprise.","Energy; Metric; Scenario; Sustainability indicator; Sustainable development","Economic and social effects; Energy management; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Renewable energy resources; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Non-fossil fuels; Energy; Metric; Scenario; Sustainability indicator; Sustainable development; Energy conservation",,,,,,"(1999) A Better Quality of Life: A Strategy for Sustainable Development for the UK, Cm 4345, , The Stationery Office, London, UK; Azapagic, A., Perdan, S., Indicators of sustainable development for industry: A general framework (2000) Trans IChemE, Part B, Proc Safe Env Prot, 78, p. 243; Bell, S., Morse, S., (1999) Sustainability Indicators, Measuring the Immeasurable?, , Earthscan, London, UK; Boyle, G., (1998) Renewable Energy - Power for a Sustainable Future, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK; (1997) The UK Indicators of Performance 1990-1996, , CIA, London, UK; Golub, A.L., (1997) Decision Analysis: An Integrated Approach, , John Wiley, New York, USA; Hertwich, E.G., Hammitt, J.K., A decision-analytic framework for impact assessment - Part I: LCA and decision analysis (2001) Int J Life Cycle Ass, 6 (1), pp. 5-12; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M., Van der Linden, P.J., Xiaosu, D., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
