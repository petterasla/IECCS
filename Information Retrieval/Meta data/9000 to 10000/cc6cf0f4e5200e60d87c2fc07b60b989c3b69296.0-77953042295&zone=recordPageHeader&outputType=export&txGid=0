Although the use of HFC134a is currently dominant, it is being phased out in Europe and most developed countries due to its high potential contribution to global warming. To solve this problem, cycle simulation and experimental measurements are conducted with a new refrigerant mixture of 88%RE170/12%R600a using actual domestic water purifiers. This mixture has been recently numbered and listed as R510A by ASHRAE. Test results show that, due to the small internal volume of the refrigeration system of the domestic water purifiers, system performance with R510A is greatly influenced by the amount of charge. With the optimum charge amount of 20 to 21 g, approximately 50% that of HFC134a, the energy consumption of R510A is 22.3% lower than that of HFC134a. The compressor discharge temperature of R510A is 3.7°C lower than that of HFC134a at the optimum charge. Overall, R510A, a new, long term, and environmentally safe refrigerant, is a good alternative for HFC134a. Furthermore, it requires only minor changes in the refrigeration system of the domestic water purifiers. © 2010 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alternative refrigerants; Domestic water purifiers; Global warming; HFC134a; Ozone depletion; R510A","Alternative refrigerant; Domestic water; Domestic water purifiers; HFC-134A; Ozone depletion; Capillary tubes; Global warming; Ozone; Ozone layer; Refrigerants; Refrigerating machinery; Refrigeration; Refrigerators; Purification",,,,,,"(1987) Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Final Act, , United Nations Environmental Programme, New York, USA: United Nations; (1997) A Brief Analysis of the Kyoto Protocol, IX (24). , Global Environmental Change Report; Official Journal of the European Union, Directive 2006/40/EC of the European parliament and of the council, (2006)Kruse, H., The state of the art of the hydrocarbon technology in household refrigeration (1996) Proceedings of the International Conferences on Ozone Protection Technologies, pp. 179-188. , Washington, DC, USA; Jung, D., Kim, C., Song, K., Park, B., Testing of propane/isobutane mixture in domestic refrigerators (2000) Int.
