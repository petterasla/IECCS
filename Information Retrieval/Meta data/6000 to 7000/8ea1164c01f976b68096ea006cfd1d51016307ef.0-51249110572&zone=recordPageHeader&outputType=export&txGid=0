Warming reduced seedling survivorship of perennials through its effects on soil water potential but the seedling survivorship of annuals was reduced to a greater extent than could be accounted for by treatment effects on soil water potential. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect seedling survivorship in annuals or perennials. • These results show that warming will alter recruitment of perennial species by changing soil water potential but will reduce recruitment of annual species independent of any effects on soil moisture. The results also show that exposure to elevated CO2 does not make seedlings more resistant to dry soils. © The Authors (2008).","Climate change and global warming; Elevated CO2; Emergence; Establishment; Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE); Grassland; Seedling recruitment; Survivorship","carbon dioxide; rain; water; carbon dioxide; emergence; global change; grassland; hypothesis testing; longevity; mortality; perennial plant; seedling establishment; soil moisture; soil water potential; survivorship; warming; article; Australia; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; longevity; metabolism; physiology; plant; Poaceae; seedling; soil; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Longevity; Plants; Poaceae; Rain; Seedling; Soil; Tasmania; Temperature; Water; Australasia; Australia",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"(2007) Climate Change in Australia.
