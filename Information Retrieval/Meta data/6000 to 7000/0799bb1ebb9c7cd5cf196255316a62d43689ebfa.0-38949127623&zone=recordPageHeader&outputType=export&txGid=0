Coastal Western Australia is a natural laboratory in which to assess the effect of climate change on reef coral communities over a temporal scale unavailable to studies conducted solely on modern communities. Reef corals composing Late Pleistocene reef assemblages exposed at five distinct localities along the west Australian coast were censused and the results compared with coral occurrence data published for the modern reefs offshore of each locality. The resulting comparative data set comprises modern and Late Pleistocene reef coral communities occurring over approximately 12° of latitude. For the modern reefs this gradient includes the zone of overlap between the Dampierian and Flindersian Provinces. Modern reef coral communities show a pronounced gradient in coral composition over the latitudinal range encompassed by the study, while the gradient in community composition is not as strong for Pleistocene communities. Tropical-adapted taxa contracted their ranges north since Late Pleistocene time, emplacing two biogeographic provinces in a region in which a single province had existed previously. Beta diversity values for adjacent communities also reflect this change. Modern reefs show a distinct peak in beta diversity in the middle of the region; the peak is not matched by Pleistocene reefs. Beta diversity is correlated with distance only for comparisons between modern reefs in the north and the fossil assemblages, further supporting change in distribution of the biogeographic provinces in the study area. Coral taxa present in modern communities clearly expanded and contracted their geographic ranges in response to climate change. Those taxa that distinguish Pleistocene from modern reefs are predicted to migrate south in response to future climate change, and potentially persist in 'temperature refugia' as tropical reef communities farther north decline. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Coral paleoecology; Coral reef; Pleistocene; Range shifts; Western Australia","biodiversity; biogeography; community composition; coral reef; geographical distribution; global warming; paleoecology; Pleistocene; species occurrence; taxonomy; Australasia; Australia; Western Australia; Anthozoa; Dampieria; Flindersia",,,,,,"Baird, A.H., Babcock, R.C., Mundy, C.P., Habitat selection by larvae influences the depth distribution of six common coral species (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 252, pp. 289-293; Baird, A.H., Hughes, T.P., Competitive dominance by tabular corals: And experimental analysis of recruitment and survival of understorey assemblages (2000) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 251, pp. 117-132; Bellwood, D.R., Hughes, T.P., Regional-scale assembly rules and biodiversity of coral reefs (2001) Science, 292, pp. 1532-1535; Bray, J.R., Curtis, J.T., An ordination of the upland forest communities of southern Wisconsin (1957) Ecological Monographs, 27, pp. 325-349; Buddemeier, R.W., Smith, S.V., Coral reef growth in an era of rapidly rising sea level: Predictions and suggestion for long-term research (1988) Coral Reefs, 7, pp. 51-56; Clarke, K.R., Warwick, R.M., (1994) Change in Marine Communities: An Approach to Statistical Analysis and Interpretation, , National Environment Research Council, UK; Collins, L.B., Zhu, Z.R., Wyrwoll, K.H., The structure of the Easter Platform, Houtman-Abrolhos reefs; Pleistocene foundations and Holocene reef growth (1996) Marine Geology, 135, pp. 1-13; Done, T.J., Coral community adaptability to environmental change at the scales of regions, reefs and reef zones (1999) American Zoologist, 39, pp. 66-79; Edinger, E.N., Pandolfi, J.M., Kelley, R.A., Community structure of quaternary coral reefs compared with recent life and death assemblages (2001) Paleobiology, 27, pp. 669-694; Eisenhauer, A., Zhu, Z.R., Collins, L.B., Wyrwoll, K.H., Eichstätter, R., The last interglacial sea level change: New evidence from the Abrolhos islands, West Australia (1996) Geologische Rundschau, 85, pp. 606-614; Feely, R.A., Sabine, C.L., Lee, K., Berelson, W., Kleypas, J., Fabry, V.J., Miller, F.J., Impact of anthropogenic CO2 on the CaCO3 system in the oceans (2004) Science, 305, pp. 362-366; Glynn, P.W., Coral reef bleaching: Facts, hypotheses and implications (1996) Global Change Biology, 2, pp. 495-509; Godfrey, J.S., Ridgway, K.R., The large-scale environment of the poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current, western Australia: Longshore steric height gradients, wind stresses and geostrophic flow (1985) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 15, pp. 481-495; Goreau, T.F., The ecology of Jamaican coral reefs I.
