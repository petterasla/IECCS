Since the beginning of global warming, it has become necessary to understand the influence of typhoons on air quality. Rare data, especially particulate measurements data could be used to establish the relationship between the air pollution and typhoons. One of main limiting factors is that most of the previous chemical analyses of particulates used a relatively long sampling time, which could dilute the temporal impact of particulate characteristics and their sources. This work, depending more time-resolved measurements, focus on the characteristics and sources of high particulate matter levels and the influence of typhoons and the Pacific high system. Depending on the measurements, two pollutant groups were clearly identified in this work. The first pollutant group was the emissions from neighboring riverbeds under the strong circulation of the typhoon in the driest season and characterized as high coarse particle concentrations with high mass fraction of Ca2+. The second pollutant group was characterized as the formation and transport of secondary particles with prevalent ions of NH4 +, NO3 -, and SO4 2- and occurred in the sea-land breeze circulation under the influence the Pacific high system. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
