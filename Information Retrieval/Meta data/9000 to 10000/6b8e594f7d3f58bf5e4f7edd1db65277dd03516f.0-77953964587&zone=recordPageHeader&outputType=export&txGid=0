There have been many natural disasters such as floods, droughts, glacier collapses, typhoons, etc. Though many general circulation models have been developed and provided for worldwide hydrological and meteorological estimations, detailed causes and countermeasures on water-related disasters have not yet been resolved. Climate change and global warming in a river basin involve many different components such as hydrological, hydraulic and water resources viewpoints. Under these circumstances, water-related issues such as system dynamics, downscaling, river basin simulation and economic damage must be discussed to understand the impact evaluation linking it with human actions and the need for interdisciplinary collaborations.","Climate change; Ecology; GCM outputs; Hydraulics aspects; Water resources utilization",,,,,,,"(2000) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, , Cambridge University Press; (2007) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , Cambridge University Press; Kojiri, T., Kobayashi, T., Nozawa, T., (2008) Estimation of precipitation variation in river basin scale with GCM outputs, pp. 1551-1562. , 4th International Conference on Water Resources and Environment Research; Forrester, J.W., (1971) World Dynamics, Wright-Allen Press, , Cambridge, Massachusetts; Kojiri, T., Hori, T., Nakatsuka, J., Chong, T.-S., (2005) World continental modeling for water resources using system dynamics, , XXX IAHR Congress; Kojiri, T., Kinai, Y., Park, J.-H., (2002) Integrated river basin environment assessment on water quantity and quality by considering utilization processes, I, pp. 396-401. , Proceedings of the International Conference on Water Resources and Environment Research; Kondo, J., (1994) Environmental Meteorology, pp. 1-333. , Asakura Publishing Company; Nichols, J.W., Mckim, J.M., Andersen, M.E., Gargas, M.L., Clewell H.J.
