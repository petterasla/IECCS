These residents are increasingly likely to make HC decisions (e.g. switches to electric heat, thermostat settings, conservation investments and behavioral change) in a wider context. The question turns from 'will projected climate change reduce my HC bills?' to 'how will projected climate change, with and without these various actions, affect my HC bills, my total energy use and my greenhouse gas emissions?' We modeled these 3 variables (HC expense, energy use and GHG emissions) on average households in 13 states in the northeastern United States under projected climate change alone, and under projected climate change with 3 modeled choices: increasing use of air-conditioners (AC); switching from petroleum-derived fuels to electric heating; and investing in insulation and efficiency upgrades. High climate change was projected to reduce annual HC expenses for average households in each state, the effect increasing through the century. These savings varied with ratios of heating degree-day to cooling degree-day changes, and with ratios of petroleum-derivative heating to electric heating households; both ratios varied along a north-south gradient in this region. Increasing AC use increased total energy use and CO 2 emissions more than it did expenses. Fuel-switching increased the first 2 more than it reduced the third. Upgrades provided the greatest savings in all 3 variables under low and high climate change. Effective energy policies and effective communication with energy users both require require explicit investigation of HC intensities at the household level, and modeling of conservation behaviors as well as purchased upgrades. © Inter-Research 2009.","Climate change; Conservation; Consumer decisions; Cooling; Economics; Energy use; Heating; Household","Behavioral changes; Consumer decisions; Cooling degree-days; Cooling energy; Economic impacts; Effective communication; Effective energy; Electric heat; Energy use; Energy users; GHG emission; Global climate changes; Heating degree-days; Household; Household level; Petroleum-derived fuels; Total energy; Cooling; Economics; Electric heating; Electric insulation; Electric switches; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Leakage (fluid); Climatology; climate change; climate effect; comparative study; consumption behavior; cooling; economic impact; energy use; heating; household energy",,,,,,"Amato, A.D., (2004) Energy demand responses to temperature and implications of climate change, , Doctoral dissertation, School of Public Affairs, University of Maryland, College Park, MD; Amato, A.D., Ruth, M., Kirshen, P., Horwitz, J., Regional energy demand responses to climate change: Methodology and application to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (2005) Clim Change, 71, pp. 175-201; Belzer, D.B., Scott, M.J., Sands, R.D., Climate change impacts on US commercial building energy consumption: An analysis using sample survey data (1996) Energy Sources, 18, pp. 177-201; Bord, R.J., O'Connor, R.E., Fisher, A., In what sense does the public need to understand global climate change?
