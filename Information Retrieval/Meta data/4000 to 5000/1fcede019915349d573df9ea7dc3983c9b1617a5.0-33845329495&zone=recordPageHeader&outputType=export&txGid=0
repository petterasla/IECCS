These have been applied to existing and new models for a range of climate-sensitive diseases in order to estimate the effect of global climate change on current disease burdens and likely proportional changes in the future. The comparative risk assessment approach has been used to assess the health consequences of climate change worldwide, to inform decisions on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and in a regional assessment of the Oceania region in the Pacific Ocean to provide more location-specific information relevant to local mitigation and adaptation decisions. The approach places climate change within the same criteria for epidemiologic assessment as other health risks and accounts for the size of the burden of climate-sensitive diseases rather than just proportional change, which highlights the importance of small proportional changes in diseases such as diarrhea and malnutrition that cause a large burden. These exercises help clarify important knowledge gaps such as a relatively poor understanding of the role of nonclimatic factors (socioeconomic and other) that may modify future climatic influences and a lack of empiric evidence and methods for quantifying more complex climate-health relationships, which consequently are often excluded from consideration. These exercises highlight the need for risk assessment frameworks that make the best use of traditional epidemiologic methods and that also fully consider the specific characteristics of climate change. These include the long-term and uncertain nature of the exposure and the effects on multiple physical and biotic systems that have the potential for diverse and widespread effects, including high-impact events.","Burden of disease; Climate change; National; Quantitative comparative risk assessment; Regional","article; climate change; communicable disease; diarrhea; disaster; environmental change; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; health care planning; health care policy; human; malaria; malnutrition; mortality; outcome assessment; Pacific islands; priority journal; public health; risk assessment; risk factor; socioeconomics; Climate; Cost of Illness; Disease; Environmental Health; Humans; Public Health; Risk Assessment",,,,,,"Arnell, N.W., Climate change and global water resources (1999) Glob Environ Change, 9, pp. S31-S51; Arnell, N.W., Cannell, M.G.R., Hulme, M., Mitchell, J.F.B., Kovats, R.S., Nicholls, R.J., The consequences of CO2 stabilization for the impacts of climate change (2002) Clim Change, 53, pp. 413-446; Beggs, P.J., Impacts of climate change on aeroallergens: Past and future (2004) Clin Exp Allergy, 34, pp. 1507-1513; Bryan, J.H., Foley, D.H., Sutherst, R.W., Malaria transmission and climate change in Australia (1996) Med J Aust, 164, pp. 345-347; Trends Online: A Compendium of Data on Global Change (2003), http://cdiac.ornl.gov/, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center.
