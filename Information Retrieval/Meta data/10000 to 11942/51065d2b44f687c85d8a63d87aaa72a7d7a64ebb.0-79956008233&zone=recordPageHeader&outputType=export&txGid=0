In a factorial experiment in northeast China, we tested the effects of raised levels of nitrogen (0, 1 and 2 g m-2 year-1), phosphorus (0, 0. 1 and 0. 2 g m-2 year-1) and temperature (ambient and +3°C) on Polytrichum strictum, Sphagnum magellanicum and S. palustre, to see if the effects could be altered by inter-specific interactions. In all species, growth declined with nitrogen addition and increased with phosphorus addition, but only P. strictum responded to raised temperature with increased production of side-shoots (branching). In Sphagnum, growth and branching changed in the same direction, but in Polytrichum, the two responses were uncoupled: with nitrogen addition there was a decrease in growth (smaller than in Sphagnum) but an increase in branching; with phosphorus addition growth increased but branching was unaffected. There were no two-way interactions among the P, N and T treatments. With increasing temperature, our results indicate that S. palustre should decrease relative to P. strictum (Polytrichum increased its branching and had a negative neighbor effect on S. palustre). With a slight increase in phosphorus availability, the increase in length growth and production of side-shoots in P. strictum and S. magellanicum may give them a competitive superiority over S. palustre. The negative response in Sphagnum to nitrogen could favor the expansion of vascular plants, but P. strictum may endure thanks to its increased branching. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Branching; Inter-specific interaction; Polytrichum; Sphagnum; Warming","nitrogen; phosphorus; community composition; environmental change; eutrophication; experimental study; global warming; growth response; interspecific interaction; moss; nitrogen; peatland; phosphorus; species diversity; temperature effect; vascular plant; article; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; moss; physiology; population dynamics; species difference; temperature; Bryophyta; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Population Dynamics; Species Specificity; Temperature; China; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Polytrichum; Polytrichum strictum; Sphagnum; Sphagnum magellanicum; Sphagnum palustre; Tracheophyta",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Phosphorus, 7723-14-0",,,,"Aarssen, L.W., Keogh, T., Conundrums of competitive ability in plants: what to measure?
