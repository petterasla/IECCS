Both records cover the period from AD 800 until the present and show corresponding patterns of sea-level change when corrected for trends which could accommodate millennial-scale isostatic adjustments. The records provide a detailed sea-level chronology for the last few centuries and thus link the instrumental (tide-gauge) record with the long-term geological record of sea-level change. Results show that sea level was relatively stable between AD 800 and 1300 and reached a lowstand around AD 1800, which was preceded by an oscillation in the eighteenth century. Since AD 1800, sea levels in the Gulf of Maine have risen by 0.3-0.4 m. The onset of this rise corresponds with regional climatic warming and could be interpreted as thermal expansion of the Gulf of Maine and North Atlantic sea surface. Sea-level rise possibly slowed temporarily during the mid-nineteenth century, but twentieth-century rates are unprecedented in the last millennium and correspond with hemispheric warming.","'Little Ice Age'; Ambrosia rise; Global warming; Gulf of Maine; Late Holocene; Salt-marsh foraminifera; Sea-level change; Tide-gauge records","global warming; Holocene; saltmarsh; sea level change; tide gauge; Atlantic Ocean; Ambrosia; Foraminifera",,,,,,"Barnhardt, W.A., Gehrels, W.R., Belknap, D.F., Kelley, J.T., Late Quaternary relative sea-level change in the western Gulf of Maine: Evidence for glacial forebulge migration (1995) Geology, 23, pp. 317-320; Beltrami, H., Wang, J., Bras, R.L., Energy balance at the Earth's surface: Heat flux history in eastern Canada (2000) Geophysical Research Letters, 27, pp. 3385-3388; Chadbourne, A.H., (1955) Maine place names and the peopling of its towns - Washington County, , Freeport, Maine: Bond Wheelwright Company; Church, J.A., Gregoray, J.M., Huybrechts, P., Kuhn, M., Lambeck, K., Nhuan, M.T., Qin, D., Woodworth, P.L., Changes in sea level (2001) Climate change 2001: The scientific basis.
