Therefore, the coastal management and the design of new defence works of the littoral have to be made with the utmost care, possibly with the aid of numerical predictions of the coastal morphodynamics and the flood risk analysis of the lowland involved. In the study area, land may subside due to sediment natural compaction and subsurface fluid (water and gas) withdrawal. At the same time, littoral transport of solid material can contribute appreciably to change the shore morphology. Mean sea level may rise permanently due to global climate change (eustatism) and occasionally due to tides and intensive storm events. The predictions of each individual process is obtained using various ad hoc mathematical models and the outcome of the numerical simulations are managed with a GIS (geographical information system). Coastline evolution until the year 2100 is investigated and risk factor maps of the low-lying coastal areas are generated which account for the hazard of the expected event, and the land economic value and vulnerability. @ 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
