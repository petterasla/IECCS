Chaotic and catastrophic dynamic patterns are shown to be possible, along with other complex dynamics arising from non-linearities in such combined systems. Problems associated with amplified oscillations due to these non-linear interactions in the combined interactions of human economic decisionmaking with ecological dynamics are identified and discussed. Implications for policy are examined with strong recommendations for greater emphasis, in particular upon the precautionary principle to avoid catastrophic collapses beyond critical thresholds and the Scale-Matching Principle to ensure that efforts to manage complex non-linear dynamics are directed at the appropriate levels of ecologic-economic interaction. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Catastrophe; Chaos; Complex dynamics; Fisheries; Global warming","ecological economics; environmental policy; global warming; precautionary principle",,,,,,"Allen, J.C., Schaffer, W.M., Rosko, D., Chaos reduces species extinction by amplifying local population noise (1993) Nature, 364, pp. 229-232; Allen, T.F.H., Starr, T.B., (1982) Hierarchy: Perspectives for Ecological Complexity, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Aoki, M., (1996) New Approaches to Macroeconomic Modelling: Evolutionary Stochastic Dynamics, Multiple Equilibria, and Externalities as Field Effects, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Arnol'd, V.I., (1992) Catastrophe Theory, 3rd., , Springer-Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg; Arthur, W.B., Durlauf, S.N., Lane, D.A., (1997) The Economy as a Complex Evolving System II, , Addison-Wesley, Redwood City, CA; Brock, W.A., Pathways to randomness in the economy: Emergent nonlinearity in economics and finance (1993) Estudios Económicos, 8 (1), pp. 3-55; Brock, W.A., Durlauf, S.N., (2001) Discrete choice with social interactions I: theory, , SSRI Working Paper No. 9521, University of Wisconsin-Madison (Review of Economic Studies, forthcoming); Bryson, R.A., Murray, T.J., (1977) Climates of Hunger: Mankind in Changing World Weather, , University of Wisconsin Press, Madison; Carpenter, S.R., Ludwig, D., Brock , W.A., 1999.
