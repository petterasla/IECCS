To quantify the dependence of the projected change on the sea surface temperature (SST) prescribed to the 20-km model, we have taken different SSTs given by the two Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM)s of MRI-CGCM2.3.2 and MIROC(hires). In the future climate simulations, the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B emission scenario was assumed. The future climate simulations show that precipitation and its intensity increase over the Yangtze River valley of China and Western Japan. The termination of the Baiu season tends to be delayed until August. These changes were consistently found in the simulations regardless of different SSTs. © 2008, the Meteorological Society of Japan.",,,,,,,,"Adler, R.F., Huffman, G.J., Chang, A., Ferrano, R., Xie, P.-P., Janowiak, J., Rudolf, B., Nelkin, E., The Version-2 Global Precipitation Climatology Preject (GPCP) Monthly Precipitation Analysis Present) (2003) J Hydrometeor, 4, pp. 1147-1167; Bengtsson, L., Botzet, M., Esch, M., Will greenhouse gas-induced warming over the next 50 years lead to higher frequency and greater intensity of hurricanes?
