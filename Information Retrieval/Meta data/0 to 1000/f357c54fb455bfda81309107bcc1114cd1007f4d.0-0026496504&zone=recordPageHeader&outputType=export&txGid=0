Implementable agreements have a reasonable chance of being ratified by nation states that are the greatest contributors to the problem; are acceptable to parties with the resources to do something about it; and induce voluntary compliance. This article contends that, aside from domestic political characteristics, other factors contributing to effective implementation of international agreements are their structure, requirements, and expectations. Factors that optimize implementable agreements include: a sufficient number of relevant participants in negotiations to enhance their legitimacy; reliance on confidence-building to deter non-compliance; stating precisely the signatory obligations; and designing treaties to be renegotiable in the face of changing scientific, political, and economic conditions. Global environmental agreements most likely to obtain signatory compliance will avoid overly stringent standards; allow variable compliance and discretion in implementation; consult domestic interests at each stage of agreement 'design' and execution; permit transfers of resources and technology; and rely on 'functional integration' to build confidence. © 1992.",,"climatic change; environmental agreement; implementation procedure; international institution; negotiation process; treaty design",,,,,,"Ripley, (1985) Policy Analysis in Political Science, , Studies of environmental policy implementation typically are concerned with ‘policy design’, the effectiveness of bureaucratic actions to attain legislative goals, and the obstacles and opportunities for compliance., Nelson-Hall, Chicago, IL, See; Ripley, Franklin, Maas, Bureaucracy and Policy Implementation (1982) Saving the Mediterranean: The Politics of International Environmental Cooperation, , Dorsey, Homewood, IL, Some recent studies on transnational environmental policy implementation include; (1982), Earthscan, New York, NYJacobson, Weiss, Implementing and complying with international environmental accords: A framework for research (1990) paper presented at American Political Science Association meeting, , San Francisco, CA; Brown, Wolf, Charting a sustainable course (1987) State of the World 1987: A Worldwatch Institute Report on Progress Toward A Sustainable Society, pp. 196-213. , A handful of countries currently produce most of the carbon dioxide and other trace gases that contribute to global warming. The USA, the USSR and China account for 23, 18, and 9%, respectively, of global CO2 production, or roughly 1/2 of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. Similarly, it is estimated that three countries — Brazil, Indonesia, and Zaire — which collectively account for 48% of the world's tropical rain forests, play a disproportionate role in carbon sequestering due to their large forestry reserves. It would be difficult to imagine an international climate change agreement designed to address carbon sequestering that did not encompass these three countries., See, Lester R. Brown et al., W.W.

Carroll, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Familiar examples of functional integration include global weather forecasting and climatological data compilation, performed by the World Meteorological Organization, air traffic control, undertaken by the International Civil Aviation Organization, and safeguarding of nuclear materials, by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Nations pool only so much authority as is required for execution of the agency's tasks. The agency does not interfere with the sovereign rights of states. In addition, all stakeholders with the potential to gain or lose in the outcome of the agency's activities are included in the agency's operations. Each participant state should have a comparable voice in its operation and, ideally, contribute an equitable share of resources to ensure that the agency can perform its tasks.
