Sediment was incubated in microcosms at 6 Eh levels (-200, -100, 0, +100, +250 and +400mV) ranging from strongly reducing to moderately oxidizing conditions. Denitrification was determined using the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) inhibition and acetylene inhibition methods. Cycloheximide (C15H23NO4) was used as the fungal inhibitor and streptomycin (C21H39N7O12) as the bacterial inhibitor. At Eh values of +250mV and +400mV, denitrification rates by fungi and bacteria were 34.3-35.1% and 1.46-1.59% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that fungi were responsible for most of the denitrification under aerobic or weakly reducing conditions. On the other hand, at Eh -200mV, denitrification rates of fungi and bacteria were 17.6% and 64.9% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that bacteria were responsible for most of the denitrification under strongly reducing conditions. Results show fungal denitrification was dominant under moderately reducing to weakly oxidizing conditions (Eh&gt;+250mV), whereas bacterial denitrification was dominant under strongly reducing condition (Eh&lt;-100 mV). At Eh values between -100 to +100 mV, denitrification by fungi and bacteria were 37.9-43.2% and 53.0-51.1% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that both bacteria and fungi contributed significantly to denitrification under these redox conditions. Because N2O is an important gaseous denitrification product in sediment, fungal denitrification could be of greater ecological significance under aerobic or moderately reducing conditions contributing to greenhouse gas emission and global warming potential (GWP). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Acetylene inhibition; Bacteria; Denitrification; Fungi; Riparian wetland; Sediment redox potential (Eh); Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) inhibition; Swamp forest; Total microbes","Bacterial inhibitors; Cycloheximides; Denitrification rate; Global warming potential; Inhibition methods; Louisiana; Oxidizing conditions; Redox condition; Redox potentials; Reducing conditions; Riparian wetland; Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) inhibition; Substrate-induced respirations; Acetylene; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Fungi; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Lighting; Optical sensors; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Sedimentology; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Denitrification; acetylene; cycloheximide; nitrous oxide; streptomycin; bacterium; denitrification; fungus; inhibition; microbial activity; oxic conditions; oxidation; redox conditions; redox potential; respiration; sediment; swamp; wetland; anaerobic metabolism; analytic method; article; bacterium; controlled study; denitrification; exhaust gas; fungus; gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; microbial activity; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; sediment; waste component removal; wetland; Bacteria; Fungi; Geologic Sediments; Global Warming; Nitrogen; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wetlands; Louisiana; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",,"acetylene, 74-86-2; cycloheximide, 642-81-9, 66-81-9; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; streptomycin, 57-92-1; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Anderson, J., Domsch, K.H., Quantification of bacterial and fungal contributions to soil respiration (1973) Arch.
