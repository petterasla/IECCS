As an alternative to traditional methods involving destructive harvests or time-consuming measurements, we present a simple, general model for GPP as the product of the lifetime carbon gain by a single leaf, the daily leaf production rate, and the length of the favorable period for photosynthesis. To test the model, we estimated leaf lifetime carbon gain for 26 species using the concept of mean labor time for leaves (the part of each day the leaf functions to full capacity), average potential photosynthetic capacity over the leaf lifetime, and functional leaf longevity (leaf longevity discounted for periods within a year wholly unfavorable for photosynthesis). We found that the life-time carbon gain of leaves was rather constant across species. Moreover, when foliar biomass was regressed against functional leaf longevity, aseasonal and seasonal forests fell on a single line, suggesting that the leaf production rate during favorable periods is not substantially different among forests in the world. The gross production of forest ecosystems then can be predicted to a first approximation simply by the annual duration of the period favorable for photo-synthetic activity in any given region. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.","Functional leaf longevity; Gross primary production; Leaf longevity; Lifetime leaf carbon gain; Mean labor time of a leaf","carbon; assimilation efficiency; carbon balance; climate change; forest ecosystem; harvesting; leaf; longevity; photosynthesis; plant community; primary production; article; ecosystem; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; species difference; time; tree; Carbon; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Trees",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Ackerly, D., Self-shading, carbon gain and leaf dynamics: A test of alternative optimality models (1999) Oecologia (Berlin), 119, pp. 300-310; Ackerly, D., Bazzaz, F.A., Leaf dynamics, self-shading and carbon gain in seedlings of a tropical pioneer tree (1995) Oecologia (Berlin), 101, pp. 289-298; Adams, B., White, A., Lenton, T.M., An analysis of some diverse approaches to modeling terrestrial net primary productivity (2004) Ecological Modelling, 177, pp. 353-391; Alfaro, M.E., Bolnick, D.I., Wainwright, P.C., Evolutionary consequences of many-to-one mapping of jaw morphology to mechanics in labrid fishes (2005) American Naturalist, 165, pp. E140-E154; Bloom, A.J., Chapin, F.S., Mooney, H.A., Resource limitation in plants: An economic analogy (1985) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 16, pp. 363-392; Bray, J.R., Gorham, E., Litter production in forests of the world (1964) Advances in Ecological Research, 2, pp. 101-158; Cannell, M.G.R., (1982) World Forest Biomass and Primary Production Data, , Academic Press, London; Chabot, B.F., Hicks, D.J., The ecology of leaf life spans (1982) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 13, pp. 229-259; Chapin, F.S., Schulze, E.D., Mooney, H.A., The ecology and economics of storage in plants (1990) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 21, pp. 423-447; Díaz, S., Cabido, M., Vive la différence: Plant functional diversity matters to ecosystem processes (2001) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 16, pp. 646-655; (1993) Scaling Physiological Processes, Leaf to Globe, , Ehleringer, J.
