This broad comparative analysis is carried out for the following climate change mitigation strategies: supply-side and end-use efficiency improvements, terrestrial and geological carbon sequestration, CO2 ocean disposal and iron fertilization, nuclear power, and renewable energy generation from biomass, passive solar, solar thermal, photo-voltaics, hydroelectric and wind. In addition, because of the inherent problems of conducting an objective comparative cost-benefit analysis, 2 non-technological solutions to global warming are also discussed: curbing population growth and transitioning to a steady-state economy. © Inter-Research 2008.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation technologies; Cost-benefit analysis; Economic growth; Efficiency; Ocean fertilization; Population growth; Renewable energy","carbon sequestration; climate change; comparative study; cost-benefit analysis; economic growth; environmental management; environmental policy; fertilizer application; global warming; population growth",,,,,,"Birdsall, N., Another look at population and global warming (1992) Population, environment, and development: Proceedings of the United Nations expert group meeting on population, environment, and development, held at the United Nations Headquarters, pp. 39-54. , 20-24 January, United Nations, New York, p; Boardman, A.E., Greenberg, D.H., Vining, A.R., Weimer, D.L., (1996) Cost-benefit analysis: Concepts and practice, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Bongaarts, J., Population growth and global warming (1992) Popul Dev Rev, 18, pp. 299-319; Boyd, P.W., Jickells, T., Law, C.S., Blain, S., and others, Mesoscale iron enrichment experiments 1993-2005: Synthesis and future directions (2007) Science, 315, pp. 612-617; Bruant, R.G., Celia, M.A., Guswa, A.J., Peters, C.A., Safe storage of CO 2 in deep saline aquifers (2002) Environ Sci Technol, 36, pp. 240A-245A; Buesseler, K.O., Boyd, P.W., Will ocean fertilization work?
