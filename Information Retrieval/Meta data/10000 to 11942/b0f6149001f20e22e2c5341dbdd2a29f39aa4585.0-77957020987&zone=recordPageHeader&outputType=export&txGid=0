The vast majority of respondents recognized global warming as a problem, and most agreed that lifestyle changes are needed to combat climate change. Many also believe that climate change can be combated by application of stricter policies in the areas of vehicle technology, fuel economy, and building design. Results of the study illuminate the importance of home-zone attributes on vehicle ownership, vehicle miles, and emissions. Most households agree that energy regulations should be pursued to curb global climate change, and most prefer caps on consumption over taxation. The results suggest that substantial US energy and greenhouse gas savings are likely to come from vehicle fuel-economy regulation, rebates on relatively fuel-efficient vehicle purchases, caps on maximum household energy use, and long-term behavioral shifts. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Household energy consumption; Transport energy","Behavioral changes; Building design; Energy regulation; Fuel-efficient vehicles; Global climate changes; Household energy; Household energy use; Metropolitan area; Personal travel; Policy options; Transport energy; Vehicle ownership; Vehicle technology; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Taxation; Vehicles; Gas emissions; climate change; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; household energy; Austin; Texas; United States",,,,,,"Bannon, B., DeBell, M., Krosnick, J., (2007), http://woods.stanford.edu/docs/surveys/GW_New_Scientist_Poll_Technical_Report.pdf, Americans' Evaluation of Policies to Reduce Greenhouse Gas EmissionsClayton, M., (2007), http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0307/p01s04-sten.html, How Green is Nuclear Power?
