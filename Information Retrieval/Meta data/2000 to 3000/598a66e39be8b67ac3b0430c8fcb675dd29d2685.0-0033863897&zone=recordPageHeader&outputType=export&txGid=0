Unprecedented threats to caribou sustainability, along with the increasingly acknowledged value of indigenous hunters' contribution to caribou research, pose the additional challenge to innovate research methods that accommodate differing cultural perspective and facilitate communication among groups. This paper surveys the state of scientific knowledge of the eleven major northern mainland herds of North America. We recommend an approach to improve our working knowledge of barren-ground c aribou in order to assess better future impacts. The transfer of knowledge gained from years of research and indigenous experience on many aspects of caribou ecology should be evaluated and, where applicable, transferred to herds with more modest databases. The establishment of a North American Caribou Monitoring and Assessment System, based on a synthesis of local knowledge and research-based science, is recommended as a tool for improved communication and collective learning.",,"climate change; ungulate; North America",,,,,,"Berkes, F., (1999) Sacred Ecology: Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Resource Management, , Philadelphia: Taylor & Francis; Berman, M., Kofinas, G., Nicolson, C., (2000) Global Change, Uncertainty, and the Future of Arctic Communities, , unpuhl. ms; Burch E.S., Jr., The caribou/wild reindeer as a human resource (1972) Amer.
