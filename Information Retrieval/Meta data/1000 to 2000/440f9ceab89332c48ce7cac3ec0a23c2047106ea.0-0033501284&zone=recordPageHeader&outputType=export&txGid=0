One site was a dwarf shrub dominated, tree-line heath (450 m a.s.l.) and the other a high altitude fellfield (1150 m a.s.l.). Responses in the composition of the nematode fauna to eight growing seasons with simulated climate change were monitored. The environmental manipulations consisted of temperature increase by using passive greenhouses, NPK fertilization, and a combination of both. A total of 98 species was found at the sites, with twice as many species at the heath compared to the climatically harsh fellfield. Species similarity was low, most likely due to differences in soil type and vegetation cover. The environmental perturbations caused distinct changes in dominance and trophic structure. Taxa common at both sites responded similarly with increases in Aphelenchoides, Filenchus and Plectus, and decreases in Eudorylaimus, Monhystrella and Teratocephalus. Generally, the manipulations changed the trophic composition in favour of fungal and plant feeding species, indicating a shift in the decomposition pathway.","Arctic soil; Fertilizer; Global warming; Nematode fauna; Temperature; Trophic groups","climate change; community structure; nematode; soil fauna; subarctic region; Sweden; Aphelenchoides; Eudorylaimus; Filenchus; Monhystrella; Nematoda; Plectus; Teratocephalus",,,,,,"Addison, J., Parkinson, D., Influence of collembolan feeding activities on soil metabolism at a high arctic site (1978) Oikos, 30, pp. 529-538; Ambrose, W.R., Monitoring long-term temperature and humidity (1980) Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material, Canberra, Australia, Bulletin, 6, pp. 36-42; Anderson, R.V., Coleman, D.C., Nematode temperature responses, a niche dimension in populations of bacterial-feeding nematodes (1982) Journal of Nematology, 14, pp. 69-76; Beare, M.H., Parmelee, R.W., Hendrix, P.F., Cheng, W., Coleman, D.C., Crossley D.A., Jr., Microbial and faunal interactions and effects on litter nitrogen and decomposition in agroecosystems (1992) Ecological Monographs, 62, pp. 569-591; Bernard, E.C., Soil nematode biodiversity (1992) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 14, pp. 99-103; Boag, B., Crawford, J.W., Neilson, R., The effect of potential climatic changes on the geographical distribution of the plant-parasitic nematodes Xiphinema and Longidorus in Europe (1991) Nematologica, 37, pp. 312-323; Boag, B., Yeates, G.W., Soil nematode biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems (1998) Biodiversity and Conservation, 7, pp. 617-630; Bongers, T., The maturity index, an ecological measure of environmental disturbance based on nematode species composition (1990) Oecologia, 83, pp. 14-19; Bongers, T., De Goede, R.G.M., Korthals, G.W., Yeates, G.W., Proposed changes of c-p classification for nematodes (1995) Russian Journal of Nematology, 3, pp. 61-62; Briones, M.J.I., Ineson, P., Piearce, T.G., Effects of climate change on soil fauna: Responses of enchytraeids, Diptera larvae and tardigrades in a transplant experiment (1997) Applied Soil Ecology, 6, pp. 117-134; Chapin F.S.
