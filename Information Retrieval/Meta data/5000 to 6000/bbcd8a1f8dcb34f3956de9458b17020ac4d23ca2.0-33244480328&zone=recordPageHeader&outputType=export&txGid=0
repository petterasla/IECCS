This leads to a highly adapted timing of sexual reproduction. Winter precipitation and temperature, the main factors determining growing season length, are predicted to change with global warming. To understand their impacts on plant phenology, we studied the responses of seven alpine vascular plant species during 2001. Temperature had a clear impact on phenological patterns. The start of the reproductive development was not directly linked with the date of snowmelt, but rather with the cumulative energy input. In addition, photoperiodism may also contribute to the control of plant development through an increasing temporal adjustment of phenology until flowering. © 2006 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"climate change; global warming; phenology; photoperiod; removal experiment; snow cover; temperature; vegetation; Alps; Eurasia; Europe; Tracheophyta",,,,,,"Alatalo, J.M., Totland, O., Response to simulated climatic change in an alpine and subarctic pollen-risk strategist, Silene acaulis (1997) Global Change Biology, 3, pp. 74-79; Arroyo, M.T.K., Armesto, J.J., Villagran, C., Plant phenological pattern in the high Andean Cordillera of central Chile (1981) Journal of Ecology, 62, pp. 205-223; Baumgartner, M.F., Apfl, G., Monitoring snow cover variations in the Alps using the Alpine Snow Cover Analysis System (ASCAS) (1994) Mountain Environments in Changing Climates, , Beniston, M.
