One such tool, recently constructed for the Environment Directorate of the Commission of the European Communities,1 consists of an interactive climate change impact assessment model called ESCAPE. This paper describes the model framework and illustrates the use of ESCAPE using a range of input scenarios reflecting different global policy, economic and technological futures. Three important characteristics of the global climate change problem are well illustrated: past emissions of greenhouse gases and the inertia of the global development path have committed the world to future warming irrespective of current and near-future policy interventions; the efficacy of a climate policy implemented solely within the EC on altering the course of future climate change is very small; and the impacts of climate change on the economy and environment of the European Community differ markedly between northern and southern Europe. © 1994.",,"climatic change; ESCAPE model; planning technique; policy evaluation; regional impact; Europe",,,,,,"Dowlatabadi, Morgan, Integrated assessment of climate change (1993) Science, 259, p. 1813. , See, for example; Dowlatabadi, Morgan, Integrated assessment of climate change (1993) Science, 259, p. 1932. , See, for example; (1992) Development of a Framework for the Evaluation of Policy Options to Deal with the Greenhouse Effect: A Scientific Description of the ESCAPE Model, Version 1.1, , Climatic Research Unit, Norwich, These two reports were prepared for DGXI and are available from Mike Hulme at the Climatic Research Unit:; (1992) Development of a Framework for the Evaluation of Policy Options to Deal with the Greenhouse Effect: A User Manual for the ESCAPE Software: Version 1.1, , Climatic Research Unit, Norwich; (1992) Development of a Framework for the Evaluation of Policy Options to Deal with the Greenhouse Effect: Economic Evaluation of Impacts and Adaptive Measures in the European Community, , ERL, London, This report was prepared for DGXI and is available from Paul Wenman at Environmental Resources Limited, 106 Gloucester Place, London W1H 3BD:; Hope, Anderson, Wenman, Policy analysis of the greenhouse effect: an application of the PAGE model (1993) Energy Policy, 21, pp. 327-337; Folland, Karl, Nicholls, Nyenzi, Parker, Vinnikov, Observed climate variability and change (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, pp. 135-170. , J.T.

These patterns are referred to as the ‘low’, ‘best guess’ and ‘high’ and derive from the range of results from the seven GCM experiments used in ESCAPE. The ‘low’' and the ‘high’ patterns roughly correspond to the 90% confidence interval around the ‘best guess’.
