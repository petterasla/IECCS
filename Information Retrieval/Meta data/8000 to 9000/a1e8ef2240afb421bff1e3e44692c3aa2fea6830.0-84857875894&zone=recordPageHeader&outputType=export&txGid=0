These technologies include flaring, conventional electricity generation technologies such as Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Gas Turbine (GT) and an emerging technology, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). The results show that SOFC is the best option for reducing the GHG emissions among the studied technologies. In the case when SOFC is used, GHG emissions from the controlled site are reduced by 63% compared to the uncontrolled site. This case has a specific lifetime GHG emission of 2.38 tonnes CO2.eq/MWh when only electricity is produced and 1.12 tonnes CO2.eq/MWh for a cogeneration application. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","GHG; global warming; greenhouse gas; landfill gas; LFG; MSW; municipal solid waste; SOFC; solid oxide fuel cell",,,,,,,"Alexander, A., Burklin, C., Singleton, A., (2005) Landfill Gas Emissions Model (LandGEM) Version 3.02 User’s Guide, , Washington: United States Environmental Protection Agency; Bove, R., Lunghi, P., Electric power generation from landfill gas using traditional and innovative technologies (2006) Energy Conversion and Management, 47, pp. 1391-1401; Climate Leaders, (2004) Direct Emissions from Municipal Solid Waste Landfilling, , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Colpan, C.O., Dincer, I., Hamdullahpur, F., Thermodynamic modeling of direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cells operating with syngas (2007) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 32, pp. 787-795; Colpan, C.O., Dincer, I., Hamdullahpur, F., A review on macro-level modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells (2008) International Journal of Energy Research, 32, pp. 336-355; Duerr, M., Gair, S., Cruden, A., McDonald, J., Hydrogen and electrical energy from organic waste treatment (2007) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 32, pp. 705-709; Environment Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency, (2002) Guidance on Landfill Gas Flaring; Environment Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency, (2004) Guidance for Monitoring Landfill Gas Engine Emissions; EPA, (1998) Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, AP-42, Volume 1: Stationary Point and Area Sources, , 5th ed., Ch. 2.4, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards.
