The regulations on environmentally acceptable substances are different from country to country and are subject to frequent updates. In our article, the following mixtures are under consideration: R-401B, R-401C, R-402A, R-404A, R-406A, R-408A, R-409A, R-410A, R-410B and R-507. Some of them do not have zero ODP, but they are in use due to their low ODP. We are focused on performance comparisons of these working fluids in vapor compression refrigerating cycles. Our effort was conducted on the basis of exergy aspects. Various parameters of the cycles were changed within a suitable range, and the results obtained were plotted in graphs of exergy efficiency factors or presented in Grassmann diagrams and tables. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
