While a relatively large body of literature exists on other economic aspects of global warming, in particular the costs of carbon abatement, the question of greenhouse damage valuation has gained little attention so far. The first part of the paper surveys the results of existing analyses on the costs of global warming. The second part discusses the main shortcomings of these studies and the main problems faced by researchers in this area. © 1995.",,"economic assessment; environmental damage; environmental economics; global warming",,,,,,"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Impacts Assessment, , Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra; Smith, Tirpak, (1989) The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change on the United States, , US Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC; Parry, Carter, Konijn, (1988) The Impacts of Climate Variations on Agriculture, , Kluwer, Dordrecht, 2 volumes; Waggoner, (1990) Climate Change and US Water Resources, , Wiley, New York; Peters, Lovejoy, (1992) Global Warming and Biological Diversity, , Yale University Press, New Haven, CT; World Health Organization, (1990) Potential Health Effects of Climatic Change, , Geneva; Rotmans, de Boois, Swart, An integrated model for the assessment of the greenhouse effect: the Dutch approach (1990) Climatic Change, 16, pp. 331-355. , Models which provide a reasonably detailed assessment of greenhouse damage even at a regional level include IMAGE and ESCAPE, see; Climate Research Unit, (1992) A Scientific Description of the ESCAPE Model, , University of East Anglia, Norwich; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Impacts Assessment, , Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, See; Cline, (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC; Adams, Crosenzweig, Peart, Ritchie, McCarl, Glyer, Curry, Allen, Jr, Global climate change and US agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-223. , For example; Kane, Reilly, Tobey, An empirical study of the economic effects of climate change on world agriculture (1992) Climatic Change, 21, pp. 17-35; Rosenzweig, Parry, Potential impact of climate change on world food supply (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 133-138; Titus, Park, Leatherman, Weggel, Greene, Mausel, Brown, Yohe, Greenhouse effect and sea level rise: the cost of holding back the sea (1991) Coastal Zone Management, 19, pp. 172-204. , For example; Rijsberman, Potential costs of adapting to sea level rise in OECD countries (1991) Responding to Climate Change: Selected Economic Issues, , OECD, Paris; Fankhauser, Protection vs retreat: the economic costs of sea level rise (1994) Environment and Planning A, , forthcoming; Cline, (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC; Nordhaus, To slow or not to slow the economics of the greenhouse effect (1991) The Economic Journal, 101 (407), pp. 920-937; Titus, The cost of climate change to the United States (1992) Global Climate Change: Implications Challenges and Mitigation Measures, , SK Majumdar, LS Kalkstein, B Yarnal, ED Miller, LM Rosenfeld, Pennsylvania Academy of Science, Pennsylvania; Fankhauser, Global Warming Damage Costs: Some Monetary Estimates (1992) CSERGE Working Paper GEC 92-29, , University College London and University of East Anglia, Norwich; Cline, The Costs and Benefits of Greenhouse Abatement: A Guide to Policy Analysis (1993) paper presented at the OECD/IEA Conference on ‘The Economics of Global Warming’, , Paris; Fankhauser, Global Warming Damage Costs: Some Monetary Estimates (1992) CSERGE Working Paper GEC 92-29, , University College London and University of East Anglia, Norwich; Cline, (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC; Titus, The cost of climate change to the United States (1992) Global Climate Change: Implications Challenges and Mitigation Measures, , SK Majumdar, LS Kalkstein, B Yarnal, EW Miller, LM Rosenfeld, Pennsylvania Academy of Science, Pennsylvania; Fankhauser, Global Warming Damage Costs: Some Monetary Estimates (1992) CSERGE Working Paper GEC 92-29, , University College London and University of East Anglia, Norwich; Tol, (1993) The Climate Fund.
