Seasonal, monthly, and annual stream discharge data from 21 stations in the Yukon River Basin were analyzed for trends over the entire period of record, generally spanning 4-6 decades, and examined for differences between the two most recent modes of the PDO: cold-PDO (1944-1975) and warm-PDO (1976-2005) subsets. Between 1944 and 2005, average winter and April flow increased at 15 sites. Observed winter flow increases during the cold-PDO phase were generally limited to sites in the Upper Yukon River Basin. Positive trends in winter flow during the warm-PDO phase broadened to include stations in the Middle and Lower Yukon River drainage basins. Increases in winter streamflow most likely result from groundwater input enhanced by permafrost thawing that promotes infiltration and deeper subsurface flow paths. Increased April flow may be attributed to a combination of greater baseflow (from groundwater increases), earlier spring snowmelt and runoff, and increased winter precipitation, depending on location. Calculated deviations from long-term mean monthly discharges indicate below-average flow in the winter months during the cold PDO and above-average flow in the winter months during the warm PDO. Although not as strong a signal, results also support the reverse response during the summer months: above-average flow during the cold PDO and below-average flow during the warm PDO. Changes in the summer flows are likely an indirect consequence of the PDO, resulting from earlier spring snowmelt runoff and also perhaps increased summer infiltration and storage in a deeper active layer. Annual discharge has remained relatively unchanged in the Yukon River Basin, but a few glacier-fed rivers demonstrate positive trends, which can be attributed to enhanced glacier melting. A positive trend in annual flow during the warm PDO near the mouth of the Yukon River suggests that small increases in flow throughout the Yukon River Basin have resulted in an additive effect manifested in the downstream-most streamflow station. Many of the identified changes in streamflow patterns in the Yukon River Basin show a correlation to the PDO regime shift. This work highlights the importance of considering proximate climate forcings as well as global climate change when assessing hydrologic changes in the Arctic.","Pacific Decadal Oscillation; Permafrost thaw; Streamflow trends; Yukon River","Active layers; Additive effects; Annual flows; Baseflow; Climate forcings; Drainage basins; Glacier melting; Global climate changes; Hydrologic changes; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; Regime shifts; River basins; Snow melts; Snowmelt runoffs; Stream discharges; Streamflow trends; Sub-surface flows; Summer months; Winter months; Winter precipitations; Winter streamflow; Yukon River; Catchments; Climate change; Glaciers; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Permafrost; Runoff; Seepage; Snow melting systems; Soil mechanics; Stream flow; Thawing; Watersheds; Rivers; climate change; drainage basin; glacier; global climate; melting; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; permafrost; streamflow; thawing; Alaska; Canada; North America; United States; Yukon Basin",,,,,,"(1996) The Impacts of Global Climate Change in the Bering Sea Region, , BESIS Bering Sea Impacts Study, Girdwood, Alaska, September 18-21, 42 p; Brabets, T.P., Wang, B., Meade, R.H., Environmental and Hydrologic Overview of the Yukon River Basin, Alaska and Canada (2000) US Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report, , 99-4204; Brown, J., Ferrians Jr., O.J., Heginbottom, J.A., Melnikov, E.S., (1997) Circum-Arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground Ice Conditions: US Geological Survey Circum-Pacific Map Series, Map CP-45; Burn, D.H., Climatic influences on streamflow timing in the headwaters of the Mackenzie River Basin (2008) Journal of Hydrology, 352, pp. 225-238; Cleveland, W.S., Devlin, S.J., Locally-weighted regression: an approach to regression by local fitting (1988) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 83, pp. 596-610; Cohn, T.A., Lins, H.F., Nature's style: naturally trendy (2005) Geophysical Research Letters, 32, pp. L23402. , 10.1029/2005GL024476; Ferrians Jr., O.J., Permafrost Map of Alaska (1965) US Geological Survey Miscellaneous Geologic Investigations Map, pp. I-445. , Scale 1:2,500,000; Folland, C.K., Karl, T.R., Christy, J.R., Clarke, R.A., Gruza, G.V., Jouzel, J., Mann, M.E., Wang, S.W., Observed climate variability and change (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 99-181. , Houghton J.T., Ding Y., Griggs D.J., Noguer M., Van der Linden P.J., Dai X., Maskell K., and Johnson C.A.
