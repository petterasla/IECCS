The date of freezeup is related to the date on which the running mean air temperature during n days fell to 0°C where 55 ≤ n ≤ 100 for early and late freezeup respectively. The mean duration of ice cover was 71.7 days (range 18-96) days). Average mean ice thickness was 32 cm and maximum ice thickness in a given year is related to the intensity of cooling measured in degree days of freezing. Breakup normally occurs more rapidly than in smaller, completely ice-covered lakes as a result of the mechanical action of waves and currents. -from Author",,"climate warming; ice; lake ice; Canada, Great Lakes, Lake Ontario",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03801330,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026289892
