The effects of Saudi Arabia climate change and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the variation of these parameters were analysed. In recent years, there have been numerous studies of trends in extreme temperature, heat island effects and precipitation and temperature indices from around the world. This study presents a long-term analysis of air temperature and precipitation in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. One dimensional continuous wavelet and discrete wavelet packets were used to study variations in air temperature and precipitation within the study areas for the sub-period 1983-1998. The temperature indices were computed from daily and monthly maximum, minimum and mean air temperature values for selected stations in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. A set of eight temperature indices was selected for this study. The precipitation indices were computed from daily and monthly rainfall rate for all stations in the two countries. Two precipitation indices were selected to analyse the effects of micro-, meso- and large-scale fluctuations. Indices change significantly as the climatic dynamics change from one season to another. Wavelet techniques are capable of revealing various aspects of data that allow investigation of climate dynamics and global warming. In conclusion, some similarities were defined between seasonal temperature values in Kandilli and Medina, and the negative role of positive NAO values on air temperature variations.","NAO; Temperature-precipitation indices; Wavelet","rain; air temperature; article; Asia; climate change; greenhouse effect; precipitation; Saudi Arabia; seasonal variation; trend study; Turkey (republic)",,,,,,"Abdullah, M.A., Al-Mazroui, M.A., Climatological study of the south-western region of Saudi Arabia.
