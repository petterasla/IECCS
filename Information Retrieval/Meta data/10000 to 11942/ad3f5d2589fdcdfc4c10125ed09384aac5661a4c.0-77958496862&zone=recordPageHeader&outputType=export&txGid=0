Accordingly, the lap welding of Zn-coated steels process, which is commonly used for producing car doors, has been gradually developed to lap welding of Zn-coated steel to light materials, such as Al alloy, Mg alloy and composite materials, in order to effectively reduce the vehicle weight. In certain part of car manufacture, organic glues are used to temporally join the Zn-coated steels and Al alloys before permanent welding takes place. The stability of such temporary joining by glues needs improving. Laser "" stitching"" or low strength welding could be considered as an alternative. However, challenges exist in joining Zn-coated steel on Al alloy by laser welding, due to significant differences of material properties between the two welding materials. Porosity, spatter and intermetallic brittle phases are readily produced in the weld. In this study, the effects of welding speed, laser power, number of the welding passes and type of shielding gas in gap-free welding of Zn-coated steel on Al alloy were investigated using a 1. kW single mode continuous wave fibre laser. Results show that a weld with higher shear strengths in the laser stitching application and less intermetallic phases could be obtained when nitrogen gas was used as the shielding gas. The corrosion resistance and the surface finish of the weld could be improved in double pass welding, especially when argon gas was used as the shielding gas. © 2010.","Al alloy; Laser welding; Zn-coated steel","Al alloys; Argon gas; Automotive applications; Car door; Car manufacture; Coated steel; Commonly used; Continuous Wave; Double pass; Energy wastes; Environmental pollutions; European Union; Fibre lasers; Intermetallic phasis; Laser power; Laser welding; Light materials; Light weight; Material property; Mg alloy; Nitrogen gas; Organic glue; Shielding gas; Single mode; Surface finishes; Vehicle weights; Welding materials; Welding speed; Alloys; Aluminum; Argon; Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Coated materials; Corrosion resistance; Energy conversion; Gases; Global warming; Glues; Gluing; Joining; Laser beam welding; Nitrogen; Shielding; Welds; Zinc; Industrial applications",,,,,,"Vollertsen, F., Thomy, C., (2005), pp. 254-63. , Welding with fibre lasers from 200 to 17000W.
