In recent years, global warming and changes in climates depending on the increase in the green house gases have been affecting the whole world. The solution seeking, initiated in the international arena with various treaties and processes, has shown itself around the world and in our country as the concept of planning and operation of the forest sources. During the recent ten years in Turkey, in forest management plans, the capacity of carbon storage and the amount of oxygen production by the forest were initiated to be calculated in the planning unit scale. The first forest management plans were prepared and put into force in 1972 in Turkey, where the planned forestry began in 1963. During the period of more than 30 years, neither the structural changes in forests nor their values regarding other functions have been examined enough. In this article, using Balci Forest Management Units in Borçka Township of Artvin, forests are studied regarding their growing stocks, timber increments, their capacities of carbon storage and oxygen production. The basic management unit scale in the study is standard and the evident standard parameters are tree species, mixture and age class. Balci Management Unit underwent attacks from bark beetles in the past. After the mechanical struggle, there have been structural changes in forest ecosystem and the potentials of forests have varied both in quality and quantity. Changes in forest ecosystems during that time, not only through natural ways but also through human activities, have been shaping the oncoming forestry practices. © 2009 Academic Journals.","Carbon storage; Forest management; Geographic information systems; Land cover change; Oxygen production","carbon; oxygen; adult; article; biomass; carbon storage; case report; forest management; forest structure; geographic distribution; human; nonhuman; planning; tree; Turkey (republic); Scolytinae",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Adger, W.N., Brown, K., (1994) Land Use and the Causes of Global Warming, , Chichester, Wiley; (1984) Artvin Forest Regional Directorate, Borçka Forest Enterprise, Management Plan of Balci Forest Planning Unit between 1984 and 2003, , Anonymous; (2006) Artvin Forest Regional Directorate, Borçka Forest Enterprise, Management Plan of Balci Forest Planning Unit between 2006 and 2025, , Anonymous; Asan, Ü., Destan, S., Özkan, U.Y., İstanbul korularinin karbon depolama, oksijen üretimi ve toz tutma kapasitesinin kestirilmesi (2002) Orman Amenajamaninda Kavramsal Açilimlar Ve Yeni Hedefler Sempozyumu, Bildiriler Kitabi, İstanbul, Turkey, pp. 194-202; Backéus, S., Wikström, P., Lämås, T.A., A model for regional analysis of carbon sequestration and timber production (2005) For.
