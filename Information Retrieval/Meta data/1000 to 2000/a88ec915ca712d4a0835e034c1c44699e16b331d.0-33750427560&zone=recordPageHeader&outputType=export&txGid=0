As one of means for reducing CO2 emission, constructing high-efficient power generation systems is important, since the quantity caused by power generation is enormous and high-efficient system has a possibility to be widely installed from the economic point of view. In this paper, a H2O turbine power generation system utilizing waste heat from factories is proposed. In the proposed system, the steam produced by utilizing waste heat from factories is adopted as working fluid of a gas turbine. Thus, the system can be high efficient because the most part of a turbine output can be used for driving electric power generator: this is different with a conventional gas turbine power generation system where approximately two third of turbine output is consumed to compress the working fluid gas (air). Simulation programs have been developed by using object-oriented-language C++ to evaluate various characteristics of the proposed system. The total exergetic efficiency of the system has been estimated to be 57.5% and the fuel-base exergetic efficiency to be 63.6%, when a refuse incineration plant has been taken as an example of waste-heat-emitting factories. The comparison with the characteristics of a gas turbine system using a dual fluid cycle has also been performed. It has been shown that the proposed system has higher exergetic efficiency. The potential of CO2 reduction by installing the proposed system was also investigated. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.
