The instrument used was the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), developed by the NASA Arctic Ice Mapping (AIM) group from the Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility. In November, 1995, and again in May, 1996, these topographic surveys were flown as a functionality check prior to conducting missions to measure the elevation of extensive sections of the Greenland Ice Sheet as part of NASA's Global Climate Change program. Differences between overlapping portions of both surveys are compared for quality control. An independent assessment of the accuracy of the ATM survey is provided by comparison to surface surveys which were conducted using standard techniques. The goal of these projects is to make these measurements to an accuracy of ± 10 cm. Differences between the fall 1995 and 1996 surveys provides an assessment of net changes in the beach morphology over an annual cycle.",,"airborne sensing; coastal zone management; laser; mapping; United States",,,,,,"Carter, W.E., Shrestha, R.L., Airborne laser swath mapping: Instant snapshots of our changing beaches (1997) Proc. of the Fourth International Conference on Remote Sensing for Marine and Coastal Environments, 1, pp. 298-307; Flood, M., Gutelius, B., Commercial implications of topographic terrain mapping using scanning airborne laser radar (1997) Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, 63, pp. 327-366; Krabill, W.B., Martin, C.F., Aircraft positioning using global positioning system carrier phase data (1987) Navigation, 34, pp. 1-21; Krabill, W.B., Thomas, R.H., Martin, C.F., Swift, R.N., Frederick, E.B., Accuracy of airborne laser altimetry over the Greenland ice sheet (1995) Int.
