Cultures of three species of Antarctic sea ice diatoms, Fragilariopsis cylindrus (Grunow) Krieger, Thalassiosira antarctica Comber and Entomoneis kjellmanii (P. T. Cleve) Poulin and Cardinal, were incubated in the dark and exposed to differing temperatures. Maximum dark survival times varied between 30 and 60 days. Photosynthetic parameters, photosynthetic efficiency (α), maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), showed that dark exposure had a significant impact on photoacclimation. In contrast, elevated temperatures had a relatively minor impact on photosynthetic functioning during the dark exposure period but had a considerable impact on dark survival with minimal dark survival times reduced to only 7 days when exposed to 10°C. Recovery of maximum quantum yield of fluorescence (Fv/Fm) was not significantly impacted by temperature, species or dark exposure length. Recovery rates of Fv/Fm ranged from -5. 06E-7 ± 2. 71E-7 s-1 to 1. 36E-5 ± 1. 53E-5 s-1 for monthly experiments and from -9. 63E-7 ± 7. 71E-7 s-1 to 2. 65E-5 ± 2. 97E-5 s-1 for weekly experiments. NPQ recovery was greater and more consistent than Fv/Fm recovery, ranging between 5. 74E-7 ± 8. 11E-7 s-1 to 7. 50E-3 ± 7. 1E-4 s-1. The concentration of chl-a and monosaccharides remained relatively constant in both experiments. These results suggest that there will probably be little effect on Antarctic microalgae with increasing water temperatures during the Antarctic winter. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Dark survival; Phytoplankton; Sea ice; Winter","acclimation; annual cycle; chlorophyll a; climate change; dark; diatom; experimental study; growth response; microalga; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; polar region; sea ice; survival; temperature effect; winter; Southern Ocean; Bacillariophyta; Entomoneis; Fragilariopsis cylindrus; Thalassiosira antarctica",,,,,,"Alderkamp, A.C., Buma, A.G.J., van Rijssel, M., The carbohydrates of Phaeocystis and their degradation in the microbial food web (2007) Biogeochem, 83, pp. 99-118; Andreoli, C., Moro, I., la Rocca, N., Dalla Valle, L., Masiero, L., Rascio, N., Dalla Vecchia, F., Ecological, physiological and biomolecular surveys on microalgae from Ross Sea (Antarctica) (2000) Ital J Zool, 67, pp. 147-156; Antia, N.J., Effects of temperature on the darkness survival of marine microplanktonic algae (1976) Microb Ecol, 3, pp. 41-54; Antia, N.J., Cheng, J.Y., The survival of axenic cultures of marine planktonic algae from prolonged exposure to darkness at 20°C (1970) Phycol, 9, pp. 179-183; Baldisserotto, C., Ferroni, L., Andreoli, C., Fasulo, M.P., Bonora, A., Pancaldi, S., Dark-acclimation of the chloroplast in Koliella antarctica exposed to a simulated austral night condition (2005) Arctic Antarctic Alpine Res, 37, pp. 146-156; Baldisserotto, C., Ferroni, L., Moro, I., Fasulo, M.P., Pancaldi, S., Modulations of the thylakoid system in snow xanthophycean alga cultured in the dark for two months: comparison between microspectrofluorimetric responses and morphological aspects (2005) Protoplasma, 226, pp. 125-135; Bilger, W., Björkman, O., Role of the xanthophyll cycle in photoprotection elucidated by measurements of light-induced absorbance changes, fluorescence and photosynthesis in leaves of Hedera canariensis (1990) Photosynth Res, 25, pp. 173-185; Botsford, L.W., Castilla, J.C., Peterson, C.H., The management of fisheries and marine (1997) Ecosys Sci, 277, pp. 509-515; Bunt, J.S., Lee, C.C., Data on the composition and dark survival of four sea-ice microalgae (1972) Limnol Oceanog, 17, pp. 458-461; Cullen, J.J., Davis, F.F., The blank can make a big difference in oceanographic measurements (2003) Limnol Oceanograph Bull, 12, pp. 29-35; Davison, I.R., Environmental effects on algal photosynthesis: temperature (1991) J Phycol, 27, pp. 2-8; Demmig-Adams, B., Adams, W.W., Photoprotection and other responses of plants to high light stress (1992) Ann Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol, 43, pp. 599-626; Doucette, G.J., Fryxell, G.A., Thalassiosira antarctica: vegetative and resting stage chemical composition of an ice-related marine diatom (1983) Marine Biol, 78, pp. 1-6; Eicken, H., The role of sea ice in structuring antarctic ecosystems (1992) Polar Biol, 12, pp. 3-13; Falkowski, P.G., Raven, J.A., (2007) Aquatic Photosynthesis, , 2nd edn., Oxford: Blackwell Science; Ferroni, L., Baldisserotto, C., Zennaro, V., Soldani, C., Fasulo, M., Pancaldi, S., Acclimation to darkness in the marine chlorophyte Koliellaantarctica cultured under low salinity: hypotheses on its origin in the polar environment (2007) Eur J Phycol, 42, pp. 91-104; Fiala, M., Oriol, L., Light-temperature interactions on the growth of Antarctic diatoms (1990) Polar Biol, 10, pp. 629-636; Franklin, D.J., Choi, C.J., Hughes, C., Malin, G., Berges, J.A., Effect of dead phytoplankton cells on the apparent efficiency of photosystem II (2009) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 382, pp. 35-40; Granum, E., Myklestad, S.M., Effects of NH4 + assimilation on dark carbon fixation and β-1, 3-glucan metabolism in the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum (Bracillariophyceae) (1999) J Phycol, 35, pp. 1191-1199; Griffith, G.P., Vennell, R., Lamare, M.D., Diadinoxanthin cycle of the bottom ice algal community in spring in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica (2009) Polar Biol, 32, pp. 623-636; Guillard, R.R., Culture of phytoplankton for feeding marine invertebrates (1975) Culture of Marine Invertebrate Animals, pp. 26-60. , W.
