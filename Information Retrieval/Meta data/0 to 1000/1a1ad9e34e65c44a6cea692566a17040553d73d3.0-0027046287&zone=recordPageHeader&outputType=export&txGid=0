However, an experiment with a deep ocean model and a (more realistic) 1% per annum increase in greenhouse gas concentrations shows the pattern of global warming to be shifted to give minimum values around Antarctica as a result of deep oceanic mixing processes in the southern ocean, consistent with similar experiments carried out at other centres. -from Authors",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; carbon dioxide; climate change; general circulation model; general circulation modelling; ocean model; Antarctica",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027046287
