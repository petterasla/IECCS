Obviously, a substantial reduction in energy consumption can be made by powering down servers when they are not in use. This paper aims at designing, implementing and evaluating a Green Scheduler for reducing energy consumption of datacenters in Cloud computing platforms. It is composed of four algorithms: prediction, ON/OFF, task scheduling, and evaluation algorithms. The prediction algorithm employs a neural predictor to predict future load demand based on historical demand. According to the prediction, the ON/OFF algorithm dynamically adjusts server allocations to minimize the number of servers running, thus minimizing the energy use at the points of consumption to benefit all other levels. The task scheduling algorithm is responsible for directing request traffic away from powered-down servers and toward active servers. The performance is monitored by the evaluation algorithm to balance the system's adaptability against stability. For evaluation, we perform simulations with two load traces. The results show that the prediction mode, with a combination of dynamic training and dynamic provisioning of 20% additional servers, can reduce energy consumption by 49.8% with a drop rate of 0.02% on one load trace, and a drop rate of 0.16% with an energy consumption reduction of 55.4% on the other. Our method is also proven to have a distinct advantage over its counterparts.
