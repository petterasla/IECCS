The objective of this paper was to investigate the role of extra-cellular enzymes in cycling of nitrogen (N) in aquatic systems. It appears that N in estuaries, salt marshes, etc., does not stay long enough to be available for uptake, thus, creating N limited conditions. This study showed that indigenous extra-cellular nitrate reductase along with others involved in N transformations in the waters/sediments of estuarine systems can cause complete removal of NH 4+ and NO3- from the waters and available NH4+ and NO3- from the sediments. These results indicate that due to high extra-cellular nitrate reductase and other enzymes associated with N transformations in sediments/waters, substantial amounts of NH4+ and NO 3- can be quickly lost from the systems as N2O and/or nitric oxide (NO), in turn, creating N limited conditions in estuarine systems. Such high activities of indigenous nitrate reductase and others are useful in removing readily bioavailable N from the systems, thereby avoidance of eutrophic conditions. However, they might contribute in increasing the N 2O, a potent greenhouse gas with global warming potential (GWP) of 296, in the atmosphere. © 2009 ONEMA.","Estuarine waters; Nitrate reductase; Nitrous oxide; Water quality",,,,,,,"Awasthi, M., Nitrate reductase activity: A solution to nitrate problems tested in free and immobilized algal cells in presence of heavy metals (2005) Intl.
