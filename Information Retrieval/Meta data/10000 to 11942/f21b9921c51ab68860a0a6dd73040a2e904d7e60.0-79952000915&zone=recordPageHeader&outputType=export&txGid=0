The first describes the use of satellite-based vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and SRS data in a skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) fishery, including a simple algorithm for determining fishing activity from vessel speed. The second case study illustrates the application of remotely sensed information in determining the impact of climate change on site suitability for scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) aquaculture. Global warming simulated according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios had a significant impact on sites with the greatest suitability for scallop aquaculture. Some challenges in the field of fisheries information systems are also discussed. © 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Oxford Journals.
