Currently Poland is experiencing vast changes in its economic structure and energy and environmental policies. This transition has the potential to translate into substantial energy savings and CO2 emissions reductions. The impact of Poland's current efforts will depend largely on the successful implementation of a wide range of already enacted energy laws and regulations, the effective use of incentives and disincentives to decrease energy consumption and the extent to which the international community aids Poland in its quest for improved energy efficiency and environmental protection. © 1991.","CO2 emissions; International cooperation; Poland","air pollution; carbon dioxide; emission control; pollution problem; structural change; Poland",,,,,,"The following carbon emission coefficients were assumed: hard coal, lignite, other solid fuels = 23.9 kg/GJ; crude oil and derivatives = 19.7 kg/GJ; natural gas = 13.8 kg/GJ.
