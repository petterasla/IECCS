World-wide, 61% of countries receive rainfall of less than 500 mm annually; domestication of wheat first occurred in such a semiarid region of southwestern Asia, and it seems that wheat foods originally came from dryland gardens. Wheat plants respond to drought through morphological, physiological and metabolic modifications in all plant parts. At the cellular level, plant responses to water deficit may result from cell damage, whereas other responses may correspond to adaptive processes. Although a large number of drought-induced genes have been identified in a wide range of wheat varieties, a molecular basis for wheat plant tolerance to water stress remains far from being completely understood. The rapid translocation of abscissic acid (ABA) in shoots via xylem flux, and the increase of ABA concentration in wheat plant parts correlate with the major physiological changes that occur during plant response to drought. It is widely accepted that ABA mediates general adaptive responses to drought. For a relatively determinate target stress environment, and with stable genotype x environment interaction, the probability for achieving progress is high. This approach will be possible only after we learn more about the physiology and genetics of wheat plant responses to water stress and their interactions. The difficulties encountered by molecular biologists in attempting to improve crop drought tolerance are due to our ignorance in agronomy and crop physiology and not to lack of knowledge or technical expertise in molecular biology. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.","Physiological adaptation; Semiarid conditions; Wheat water-saving; Yield improvement","Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Gamo, M., Classification of arid regions by climate and vegetation (1999) J Arid Land Studies, 1, pp. 9-17; Brengle, K.G., (1982) Principles and Practices of Dryland Farming, , Colorado Associated University Press Boulder; Dennis, P., Fry, G.L.A., Field margins: Can they enhance natural enemy population densities and general arthropod diversity on farmland (1992) Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Environment, 40, pp. 95-115; Shan, L., Development of tendency on dry land farming technologies (2002) Agric Sci China, 1, pp. 934-944; Deng, X.P., Shan, L., Kang, S.Z., Inanaga, S., Ali, M.E.K., Improvement of wheat water use efficiency in semiarid area of China (2003) Agricultural Sciences in China, 2, pp. 35-44; Monteith, J.L., Steps in crop climatology (1990) Challenges in Dryland Agriculture: A Global Perspective.
