The total precipitation amount and appearance frequency for daily precipitation amount simulated by the NHM-5km show notable agreement with those of the surface observation data of Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) of JMA. The temporal and spatial characteristics of maximum daily precipitation amounts (MDPs) from June to October also agree well with the observational results. The regional largest values among MDPs (R-MDPs) for 6 regions of the Japanese Islands are also estimated for the simulation results of the nearest grid points for each AMeDAS station and the AMeDAS observations. Those comparisons conclude the high performance of the NHM-5km for the reproducibility of MDPs and R-MDPs, which are highly related to extreme events. © 2008, the Meteorological Society of Japan.",,,,,,,,"Giorgi, F., Wettom, P.H., Jones, R.G., Christensen, J.H., Mearns, L.O., Hewitson, B., von Storch, H., Jack, C., Emerging patterns of simulated regional climatic changes for the 21st century due to anthropogenic forcings (2001) Geophys.
