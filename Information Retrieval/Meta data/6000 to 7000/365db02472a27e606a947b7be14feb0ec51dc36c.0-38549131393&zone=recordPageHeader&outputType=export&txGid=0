The importance of by-products is increasing, as global warming is now a significant problem, and biomass resources can be used to alleviate the energy shortage and minimise the emission of greenhouse gases. Carbonisation of bagasse can add new value for production of energy and other materials, so continuous type carbonisers were developed. The bagasse becomes charcoal by heating in the absence of oxygen for about 30 minutes at 400 to 900°C. Bagasse charcoal was used as a soil improvement material, absorbent, deodorant and so on. A large volume of burnable gas was obtained from bagasse or its charcoal by the developed gasifier. The plant turns to a carboniser by exclusion of air. Therefore, bagasse can be used as a value-added resource for energy and other materials by carbonisation and gasification.","Biomass; Carbonisation; Charcoal; Gasification; Global warming","Biomass resources; Carbonisation; Continuous types; Energy shortages; Gasification plants; Gasifiers; Large volumes; Soil improvement; Biomass; Carbonization; Charcoal; Gasification; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Bagasse",,,,,,"Autrey, L.J.C., Tonta, J.A., From sugar production to biomass utilisation: The reform process to ensure the viability of the Mauritian sugar cane industry (2005) Proc.
