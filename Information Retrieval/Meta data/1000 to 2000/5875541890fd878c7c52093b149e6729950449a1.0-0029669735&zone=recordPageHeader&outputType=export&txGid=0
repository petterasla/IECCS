Thus, a close relationship exists between the protection of ecosystem integrity and wilderness on one hand, and human health on the other. However, there is an overarching, holistic perspective in laws and regulations - as well as morality - to maintain a healthy relationship between the two. Problem areas focused on in this paper are: (a) climate change and global warming; (b) food production; and (c) global equity. This paper argues for the principle of integrity, which provides an holistic perspective, suggested as a better approach than that of current regulations to mitigate against associated threats to human health.","Ecosystem integrity; Environmental epidemiology; Environmental equity; Ethics in science; Human health","conference paper; ecosystem; epidemiology; ethics; human; law; priority journal; united states; African Americans; Attitude to Health; Ecosystem; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Epidemiology; Ethics; Health Priorities; Humans; Politics; Prejudice; United States; ecosystem integrity; environmental management; food production; global equity; global warming; health protection; racism; social policy",,,,,,"Stone, R., Global warming: If the mercury soars, so may health hazards (1995) Science, 267, pp. 957-958; Westra, L., (1994) An Environmental Proposal for Ethics: The Principle of Integrity, , Rowman & Littlefield, Lanham, MD; Karr, J.R., Ecological Integrity and Ecological Health are not the Same, Engineering within Ecological Constraints, , US National Academy of Engineering, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., in press; Karr, J.R., (1994) Landscapes and Management for Ecological Integrity, Biodiversity and Landscape: A Paradox of Humanity, pp. 227-249. , Cambridge University Press, New York, Chapter 12; Karr, J.R., Angermeier, P.L., Protecting biotic resources: Biological integrity versus biological diversity as policy directives (1994) BioScience, 44 (11), pp. 690-697. , in press; Kay, J.J., Schneider, E., The challenge of the ecosystem approach (1994) Alternatives, 20 (3), pp. 1-6; Regier, H.A., The notion of natural and cultural integrity (1993) Ecological Integrity and the Management of Ecosystems, pp. 3-18. , S.
