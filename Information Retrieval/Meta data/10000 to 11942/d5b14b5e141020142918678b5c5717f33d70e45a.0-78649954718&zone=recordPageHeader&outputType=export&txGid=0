This study investigated the heating and cooling (H-C) energy requirements and corresponding carbon emissions of residential houses in different climatic conditions in relation to global warming. This included assessing and quantifying the efficacy of emission reduction schemes based on emission reduction capacity (ERC). ERC represents the percentage of projected carbon emission reduction under changing climate in a specific year compared to the expected reduction by a scheme at current or stationary climates. It is shown that in a heating-dominated region with a cold climate or temperate climate with cold winter, ERC is projected to increase (or the projected emission reduction is higher than the expected reduction under the emission reduction scheme) in the presence of global warming. In contrast, in a cooling-dominated region with a hot dry or hot humid climate or an H-C balanced temperate climate, ERC is projected to decline. This implies that emission reductions will be lower than those initially targeted by the emission reduction scheme without consideration of global warming. Additionally, to reflect the changing carbon emission over years due to climate change, the average emission reduction capacity (AERC) was also proposed for the assessment of reduction schemes. It was concluded that the design and assessment of carbon emission reduction schemes for residential buildings need to move beyond its assumptions of a current or stationary climate to take into account climate change impacts. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change impact; Emission reduction; Emission reduction capacity; Energy efficiency; Energy rating; Residential housing","Carbon emissions; Changing climate; Climate change impact; Climatic conditions; Cold climate; Cold winter; Emission reduction; Emission reduction strategy; Energy rating; Energy requirements; Hot humid climate; Residential building; Residential house; Residential housing; Temperate climate; Apartment houses; Climatology; Emission control; Global warming; Heating; Rating; Energy efficiency; building; carbon emission; climate effect; efficiency measurement; emission control; energy efficiency; global warming; performance assessment; residential energy",,,,,,"(2007), http://www.TheCIE.com.au, CIE (Centre for International Economics).
