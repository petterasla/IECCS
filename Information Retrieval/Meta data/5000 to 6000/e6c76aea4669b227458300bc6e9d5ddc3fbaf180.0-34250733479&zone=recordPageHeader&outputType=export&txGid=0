Those works related to paleo-ENSO are reviewed in both observation and modeling studies, expecially in some specific warm or cool geological epochs, such as early-middle Holocene, Last Glacial, Last Interglacial and Eocene. Although a variety of uncertainties were still presented in paleo-ENSO research work, the mechanism for particularly weak El Niño variability during early-middle Holocene is investigated. Moreover, the paradoxes in other periods were categorized and addressed. Paleo-ENSO studies will improve the understanding of the interaction between ENSO cycle and climatological background, and will further complete ENSO dynamics so as to predict how El Niño, the strongest signal that affects global climate on interannual time scale, will behave on the global warming background.","El Niño; Glacial-Interglacial cycle; Holocene; Paleo-ENSO; Paleoclimate","El Nino-Southern Oscillation; glacial-interglacial cycle; Holocene; Last Glacial; Last Interglacial; paleobiology; paleoceanography; paleoclimate",,,,,,"Trenberth, K.E., The definition of El Niño (1997) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 78 (12), pp. 277-2777; Rasmusson, E.M., Michael, H., El Niño and variations in climate (1985) American Scientist, 73, pp. 168-177; Ropelewski, C.F., Halpert, M.S., Global and regional scale precipitation patterns associated with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (1987) Monthly Weather Review, 115, pp. 1606-1626; Huang, R.H., Zhou, L.T., Research on the characteristics, formation mechanism and prediction of severe climatic disasters in China (2002) J.
