Being S and N free and low in aromatics, the fuels are more environment friendly than those produced from crude oil. In particular, the production of environment friendly high quality diesel fuel is an attractive application of the FT process. Relatively large amounts of CO2 are produced in the gasification processes, but whether this will really contribute to global warming is a disputed question. The water effluent from an FT complex is zero. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.","Chemicals; Diesel fuel; Environment; Fischer-tropsch",,,,,,,"Dry, M.E., (1996) Appl. Catal.
