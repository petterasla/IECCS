The internal combustion engines extensively used as power and transport equipments are responsible for a major part of this pollution. In the last decades a lot of research activity was dedicated to improving efficiency by fuel consumption reduction and wasted energy recovery. In this sense the concept of thermal engine insulation has been for many years subject of intense researches dealing with the decrease of the heat transferred to the combustion chamber surroundings looking this way for thermal efficiency increasing. A lot of these efforts leaded but to controversial results. The increase in thermal efficiency expected to result from lowering the heat lost to the chamber walls was not always confirmed by experiments. The aim of this work-in-progress is to bring a contribution to understanding the existing synergies which have to be considered when promoting the energy recovery process from the exhaust and cooling systems potentialities of the internal combustion engines. In this sense it appears not so effective to apply combustion chamber walls heat insulation with the major objective of increasing engine efficiency and effective power; it seems however to be as more justified solution applying partial thermal insulation of the turbocharger and developing some energy recovery systems. Simulations performed with dedicated codes for thermodynamic engines analysis reveal the existing potentiality of energy recovery from the exhaust gases.","Efficiency; Energy; Exhaust; Insulation; Recovery",,,,,,,"Beg, R.A., Rahman, M.S., Bose, P.K., Ghosh, B.B., Performance studies on a semi-adiabatic diesel engine using vegetable oil as fuel (2002) SAE Paper 2002-01-2692; Belagur, V.K., Reddy, V., Performance and emission characteristics of a partially ceramic-coated diesel engine using water diesel emulsion (2007) SAE Paper 2007-32-0060; Birtas, A., Petcu, C., Dica, C., Chiriac, R., On the possibility to predict the performance of a tractor engine using AVL BOOST simulation code (2008) The International Conference on Automotive Engineering ""Off-road Vehicles"" - ORV 2008, , Military Technical Academy, October 12-14; Descombes, G., Maroteaux, F., Feidt, M., Study of the interaction between mechanical energy and heat exchanges applied to IC engines (2003) Applied Thermal Engineering, 23, pp. 2061-2078; Giraud, O., (1984) Contribution to the Study of Thermal Insulation in a Supercharged Compression Ignition Engine, pp. 46-53. , PhD Thesis, Pierre et Marie Curie University; Kawamura, H., Higashino, A., Sekiyama, S., Combustion and combustion chamber for a low heat rejection engine (1996) SAE Paper 960506; Kawamura, H., Development of an adiabatic engine-installed energy recover turbines and converters of CNG fuel (2003) SAE Paper 2003-01-2265; Peyrard, P., (1985) The Adiabatic Diesel Engines, pp. 46-123. , MSc Thesis Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, Paris; Rakopoulos, C.D., Andritsakis, E.C., Huontalas, D.T., The influence of the exhaust system unsteady gas flow and insulation on the performance of a turbocharged diesel engine (1995) Heat Recovery Systems and CHP Journal, 15, pp. 51-72; Tabli, M., Agnew, B., Energy recovery from diesel engine exhaust gases for performance enhancement and air conditioning (2001) 2 th International Heat Powered Cycles Conference, pp. 291-296. , University of Nottingham and Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers; Trémoulière, G., Cambou, N., Vignon, J.M., Study on modeling of the heat transfer inside the combustion chamber of a diesel engine (1987) International Congress SIA, pp. 122-127. , Diesel Engines, Ecole Centrale de Lyon","Chiriac, R.; Politehnica University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Internal Combustion Engines Department, 313 Splaiul Independentei, 6 District, 060042 Bucharest, Romania; email: raduchiriac2001@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,15829596,,,,"English","Environ.
