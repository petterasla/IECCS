The surface-energy budget effects may be more important than the carbon-cycle effects. However, land-use impacts on climate cannot be adequately quantified with the usual metric of 'global warming potential'. A new metric is needed to quantify the human disturbance of the Earth's surface-energy budget. This 'regional climate change potential' could offer a new metric for developing a more inclusive climate protocol. This concept would also implicitly provide a mechanism to monitor potential local-scale environmental changes that could influence biodiversity.","Climate-system dynamics; Global climate change; Landscape change; Landscape dynamics; Regional climate change","Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Earth (Planet); Ecosystem; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Public Policy; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Earth (Planet); Ecosystem; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Public Policy; carbon dioxide; agriculture; article; astronomy; biomass; climate; ecosystem; environment; environmental monitoring; geography; greenhouse effect; methodology; policy; theoretical model",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Avissar, R., Recent advances in the representation of land-atmosphere interactions in general circulation models (1995) Rev.
