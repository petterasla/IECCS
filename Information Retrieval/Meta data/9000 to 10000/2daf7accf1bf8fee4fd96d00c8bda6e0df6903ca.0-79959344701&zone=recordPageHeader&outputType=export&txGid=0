Due to global climate change the scientific community foresees an increase in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. The high resolution, multi-polarization and multi-incidence angle capabilities of the radar satellite TerraSAR-X, its quick site access and receiving times open interesting perspectives for flood mapping and subsequent assessment of damages. Furthermore, the nearly all-weather capacity of SAR data constitutes its main advantage above optical systems for mapping of flood events. The work presented in this paper focuses on the development of an object-based classification approach for operational flood extent mapping in near-real time conditions using TerraSAR-X data. The object-based methodology is assisted by pixel-based operations and both are implemented in a solution within the eCognition software environment. The final objective is to develop a tool which can be easily used by an interpreter without the need of a profound knowledge of image processing. For this purpose an eCognition based semi-automated solution - a Graphical User Interface with a rule set behind - is set up. This application is tested in various scenarios and is further developed in parallel to these tests. The overall study clearly demonstrates the potential of TerraSAR-X data and object oriented methods for a rapid delineation of flood extent in an operational environment. © 2010 E.
