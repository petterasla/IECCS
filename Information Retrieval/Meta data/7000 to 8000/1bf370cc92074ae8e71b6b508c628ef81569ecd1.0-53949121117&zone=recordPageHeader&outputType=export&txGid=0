The result showed that the remote sensing snow data (retrieval from SSM/I, NOAA/AVHRR) was in general agreement with the weather stations data. In temporal scale, for the seasonal cycle, during 1966 to 2003, the snow cover extent increased rapidly in autumn and winter seasons in Northern Tibet. However, in spring (March-April-May), snow cover extent did not show a continual decrease, whereas indicated a positive feedback. For the interannual cycle, from the end of 1960s the snow cover of Northern Tibet region reduced, but in 1980s, the snow cover increased as a whole, and from 1990s it decreased again. Thus, the snow cover variation showed a reducing-increasing-reducing dynamic process in the study area. The result of a wavelet analysis on temporal distributions of annual cumulative snow cover indicated that there were mainly oscillation periods of quasi-2-3 yr, quasi-9 yr, quasi-13 yr, and from the beginning of 1970s to the middle of 1990s, there was an oscillation period about quasi-5 yr. In spatial scale, the east part of Northern Tibet region was the main snow cover area, where the snow cover days exceeded 15 ten-days in each winter-spring, and were obviously distinguished from the western part of Northern Tibet region. The majority of snow cover pixels exist in altitude of 4900-5600 m. The greatest variance of snow cover was found in middle and eastern part of the Northern Tibet Plateau, i. e. Andu and Nierong regions. We selected two important factors influencing snow-cover (i. e., temperature, precipitation) and calculated multiple linear regressions. The result showed that the correlation coefficient between simulated annual cumulative snow days and observation data was 0.74. It revealed that temperature and precipitation are the main factors influencing the snow cover in Northern Tibet region. Global warming might be one reason causing snow cover declining in recent years in Northern Tibet region. However, the effect of precipitation seems larger than that of temperature.","Influencing factors; Northern Tibet; Remote sensing; Snow cover; SSM/I data","AVHRR; NOAA satellite; pixel; precipitation assessment; remote sensing; satellite data; snow; snow cover; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; SSM-I; temperature effect; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Xizang",,,,,,"Groisman, P.Y., Karl, T.R., Knight, R.W., Observed impact of snow cover on the heat balance and the rise of continental spring temperatures (1994) Science, 263, pp. 198-200; Li, P.J., Variation of snow water resources in northwestern China, 1951-1997 (1999) Since in China, 42, pp. 72-79; Zhang, J.H., Yao, F.M., Emori, S., Water-heat balances, snow and runoff dynamics in cold-temperate zone of North Hemisphere: Simulating usingeco-hydrological model Journal of Natural Disasters, 11 (4), pp. 164-169. , in Chinese; Ye, D.Z., Some physical factors in forecasting (1975) Meteorological, 3, pp. 10-12. , in Chinese; Goo, Q.Y., Wang, J.Q., The snow cover on Tibet plateau and its effect on the monsoon over east Asia (1986) Plateau Meteorology, 5 (2), pp. 116-124. , in Chinese; Brown, R.D., Northern hemisphere snow cover variability and change, 1915-1997 (2000) Journal of Climate, 13 (13), pp. 2339-2355; Daniel, J.L., Robinson, D.A., Abrupt changes in the seasonal cycle of North American snow cover (1997) Journal of Climate, 10 (10), pp. 2569-2585; Qin, D.H., Liu, S.Y., Li, P.J., Snow cover distribution, variability, and response to climate change in Western China (2006) Journal of Climate, 19 (9), pp. 1820-1833; Chen, W., Greg, H.F., Huang, R.H., The interannual variability of East Asian winter monsoon and its relation to the summer monsoon (2000) Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 17 (1), pp. 48-60; Li, P.J., Response of Tibetan snow cover to global warming (1996) Acta Geographica Sinica, 51 (3), pp. 260-265. , in Chinese; Ke, C.Q., Li, P.J., Wang, C.P., Variation trends of snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau and their relations to temperature and precipitation (1997) Journal of Glaciolgy and Geocryology, 19 (4), pp. 289-294. , in Chinese; Chen, Q.J., Gao, B., Li, W.J., Studies on relationships among snow cover winter over the Tibetan plateau and droughts/floods during Meiyu season in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river as well as atmosphere/ocean (2000) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 58 (5), pp. 582-595. , in Chinese; Yang, X.Q., Zhang, L.N., An investigation of temporal and spatial variations of 1988-1998 snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere (2001) Chinese Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, 25 (6), pp. 757-766. , in Chinese; Cai, X.Z., Wu, B., A circulation signal of abnormal snow cover over the Tibetan plateau and its relation to summer rainfall in China (2005) Quarterly Journal of Applied Meteorology, 16 (1), pp. 89-95. , in Chinese; Feng, X.Z., Lu, A.X., Zeng, Q.Z., Study on snow disaster monitoring and assessment using remote sensing in the main pastoral areas of China (1997) Journal of Remote Sensing, 1 (2), pp. 129-134. , in Chinese; Hao, L., Wang, J.A., Spatio-temporal change of snow disaster and analysis of vulnerability of animal husbandry in China (2002) J. of Natural Disasters, 11 (4), pp. 42-48. , in Chinese; Zhang, J.H., Fu, C.B., Yan, X.D., Global respondence analysis of lai versus surface air temperature and precipitation variations (2002) Chinese J.
