C2F6 consumption in the etching reactor increased with increasing ICP power deposition at fixed PFC mole fraction, and decreasing C2F6 mole fraction or total gas flow rate at constant power. The effluents were abated in the burn-box at high power with sufficiently large flow of O2, H2, or H2O. The energy efficiency of abatement was found to decrease with increasing power and decreasing additive mole fraction.",,"Flow of fluids; Gases; Heat treatment; Plasma devices; Plasma etching; Hybrid plasma equipment model; Inductively coupled plasma reactors; Mole fraction; Perfluorinated compounds; Plasma abatement; Plasma chamber; Organic compounds",,,,,,"Tserspi, A., Schwarzenbach, W., Derouard, J., Sadeghi, N., (1997) J.
