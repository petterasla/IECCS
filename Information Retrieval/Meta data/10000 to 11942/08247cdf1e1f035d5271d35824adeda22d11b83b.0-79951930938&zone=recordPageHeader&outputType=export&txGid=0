Since it makes up for about half of the energy consumption in well-insulated buildings, it is an attractive target for energy saving measures. However, simply reducing ventilation rates has unwanted repercussions on the indoor air quality. Two main strategies have been developed to reconcile these seemingly opposing interests: heat recovery and demand control ventilation. This paper focuses on the energy saving potential of demand controlled mechanical exhaust ventilation in residences and on the influence such systems may have on the indoor air quality to which the occupants of the dwellings are exposed. The conclusions are based on simulations done with a multi-zone airflow model of a detached house that is statistically representative for the average Belgian dwelling. Four approaches to demand based control are tested and reported. Within the paper exposure to carbon dioxide and to a tracer gas are used as indicators for indoor air quality. Both energy demand and exposures are reported and compared to the results for a standard, building code compliant, exhaust system, operating at continuous flow rates. The sensitivity of the control strategies to environmental and user variations is tested using Monte-Carlo techniques. Under the conditions that were applied, reductions on the ventilation heat loss of 25-60% are found, depending on the chosen control strategy (with the exclusion of adventitious ventilation and infiltration). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand control; IAQ; Monte-Carlo; Residential ventilation","Airflow model; Continuous flows; Control strategies; Demand control; Demand control ventilation; Detached house; Energy consumption; Energy demands; Energy saving; Energy saving potential; Energy-saving measures; Exhaust systems; Fossil fuel burning; Health concerns; Heat recovery; IAQ; Indoor air quality; Mechanical exhausts; Monte-Carlo; Peak Oil; Residential ventilation; Tracer gas; Ventilation rate; Ventilation strategy; Air quality; Apartment houses; Building codes; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Indoor air pollution; Sensitivity analysis; Ventilation; Ventilation exhausts; Waste heat; Quality control; air quality; airflow; computer simulation; demand analysis; energy efficiency; flow field; indoor air; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; ventilation",,,,,,"Seppanen, O.A., Fisk, W.J., Summary of human responses to ventilation (2004) Indoor Air, 14, pp. 102-118; Kovesi, T., Zaloum, C., Stocco, C., Fugler, D., Dales, R.E., Ni, A., Heat recovery ventilators prevent respiratory disorders in Inuit children (2009) Indoor Air, 19, pp. 489-499; Wargocki, P., Lagercrantz, L., Witterseh, T., Sundell, J., Wyon, D.P., Fanger, P.O., Subjective perceptions, symptom intensity and performance: a comparison of two independent studies, both changing similarly the pollution load in an office (2002) Indoor Air, 12, pp. 74-80; Juodis, E., Extracted ventilation air heat recovery efficiency as a function of a building's thermal properties (2006) Energy and Buildings, 38, pp. 568-573; (2010), Eurostat.
