Using a well-dated small mammal sequence from Homestead Cave, north-central Utah, I show that the Middle Holocene small mammal faunas of this area underwent a decrease in species richness and evenness, driven largely by a series of local extinctions and near-extinctions coupled with a dramatic increase in the abundance of taxa well-adapted to xeric conditions. At the end of this period, some taxa that require relatively mesic habitats began to increase in abundance immediately, others did not rebound in abundance until several thousand years later, while still others have not returned at all. This suite of responses has been difficult to detect because climatic change at the beginning of the Middle Holocene was so much more substantial than that which occurred toward its end.","Biotic diversity; Climate change; Global warming; Great Basin; Middle Holocene","climate change; community response; extinction; Holocene; mammal; species richness; United States",,,,,,"Aikens, C.M., Jenkins, D.L., Archaeological researches in the Northern Great Basin: Fort Rock archaeology since Cressman (1994) University of Oregon Anthropology Papers, 50; Antevs, E., Postpluvial climatic variations in the southwest (1938) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 19, pp. 190-193; Antevs, E., Climatic changes and pre-white man.
