As the largest future temperature increase is expected to occur at high latitudes, the glaciers and ice caps in the Arctic will be particularly susceptible to the expected warming. This study demonstrates the possibilities of space-borne glacier inventorying at a remote site on Cumberland Peninsula, a part of Baffin Island in Arctic Canada, thereby providing glacier inventory data for this region. Our approach combines Landsat ETM+ and Terra ASTER satellite data, an ASTER-derived digital elevation model (DEM) and Geographic Information System-based processing. We used thresholded ratio images from ETM+ bands 3 and 5 and ASTER bands 3 and 4 for glacier mapping. Manual delineation of Little Ice Age trimlines and moraines has been applied to calculate area changes for 225 glaciers, yielding an average area loss of 11%. A size distribution has been obtained for 770 glaciers that is very different from that for Alpine glaciers. Numerous three-dimensional glacier parameters were derived from the ASTER DEM for a subset of 340 glaciers. The amount of working time required for the processing has been tracked, and resulted in 5 min per glacier, or 7 years for all estimated 160 000 glaciers worldwide.",,"ASTER; digital elevation model; glacier; inventory; Landsat multispectral scanner; satellite data; Baffin Island; Canada; North America; Nunavut",,,,,,"Albert, T.H., Evaluation of remote sensing techniques for ice-area classification applied to the tropical Quelccaya ice cap, Peru (2002) Polar Geogr., 26 (3), pp. 210-226; Andrews, J.T., Miller, G.H., Quarternary [sic] history of northern Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, N.W.T., Canada: Part IV Maps of the present glaciation limits and lowest equilibrium line altitude for north and south Baffin Island (1972) Arct.
