As use of CFCs is phased out due to concerns of ozone depletion, a variety of new chemicals and technologies will be needed to serve these needs. In choosing alternatives, industry must balance concerns over safety and environmental acceptability and still meet the performance characteristics of the current CFC-based products. About 60% of projected CFC demand will either be eliminated by improved conservation practices or will be satisfied by nonfluorocarbon alternatives. With current technology, the only viable alternatives meeting the safety, performance, and environmental requirements for the remaining 40% of demand are fluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). HCFCs and HFCs possess many of the desirable properties of the CFCs, but because of the hydrogen, they react with hydroxyl in the lower atmosphere. This results in shorter atmospheric lifetimes compared to CFCs and reduces their potential to contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion or global warming; HFCs do not contain chlorine and have no potential to destroy ozone. This paper provides an overview of challenges faced by industry, regulators, and society in general in continuing to meet societal needs and consumer demands while reducing risk to the environment without compromising consumer or worker safety.",,"chlorine; chlorofluorocarbon; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; air pollution; conference paper; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental protection; ozone layer; priority journal",,"chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; fluorocarbon, 11072-16-5",,,,,"Mcfarland, M.; E.
