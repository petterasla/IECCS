As agriculture is the main sector of water use in Bangladesh, estimation of the agricultural water demand in the changing environment is essential for long-term water resources development and planning. In the present paper, a study has been carried out to estimate the change of irrigation water demand in dry-season Boro rice field in northwest Bangladesh in the context of global climate change. The study shows that there will be no appreciable changes in total irrigation water requirement due to climate change. However, there will be an increase in daily use of water for irrigation. As groundwater is the main source of irrigation in northwest Bangladesh, higher daily pumping rate in dry season may aggravate the situation of groundwater scarcity in the region. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Agricultural water; Bangladesh; Changing environment; Daily use; Dry seasons; Global climate changes; Irrigation water requirements; Irrigation waters; Pumping rate; Rice fields; Soil water balance; Water resources development; Water use; Drought; Groundwater; Irrigation; Soil moisture; Water resources; Water supply; Climate change; agricultural practice; climate change; developmental biology; dry season; estimation method; evapotranspiration; groundwater; irrigation; phenology; precipitation intensity; rice; soil water; water resource; Bangladesh",,,,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Long, S.P., What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)?
