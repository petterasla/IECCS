Maria di Galeria (Rome), Italy","In last two years offshore wind energy is becoming a focal point of national and non national organization particularly after the limitations of fossil fuel consumption, adopted by many developed countries after Kyoto conference at the end of 1997 on global climate change. North Europe is particularly interested in offshore for the limited land areas still available, due to the intensive use of its territory and its today high wind capacity. Really the total wind capacity in Europe could increase from the 1997 value of 4450 MW up to 40 000 MW within 2010, according the White Paper 1997 of the European Commission; a significant percentage (25%) could be sited offshore up to 10 000 MW, because of close saturation of the land sites at that time. World wind capacity could increase from the 1997 value of 7200 MW up to 60 000 MW within 2010 with a good percentage (20%) offshore 12 000 MW. In last seven years wind capacity is shallow waters of coastal areas has reached 34 MW. Five wind farms are functioning in the internal seas of Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden; however such siting is mostly to be considered as semi-offshore condition. North Sea at 10-20 km off the coasts of Netherland, Denmark using large size wind turbine (1-2 MW). In 1997 an offshore proposal was supported in Netherland by Greenpeace after the OWEMES '97 seminar, held in Italy on offshore wind in the spring 1997. A review is presented in the paper of the European offshore wind programs with trends in technology, economies and siting effects.",,"Offshore wind farms; Climate change; Electric power plants; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Offshore power plants; Wind turbines; Wind power; offshore activity; wind power potential; wind turbine; alternative energy; energy resource; offshore application; resource development; wind power; Europe",,,,,,"Crispin, A., Denmark's offshore ambitions rise (1998) Wind Directions, , January; De Eize, V., Offshore wind best option (1997) The Sustain.
