This paper applies the same methodology, adopted in the first part, to Norway. Needless to say, the hydrosphere has benefited from a decline in eutrophication and marine/fresh water toxicity, owing to the favourable combination of higher degrees of separation over time and source control, especially in the industrial sector. However, this has been at the expense of damage to the atmosphere (global warming). Technologies have, of course, enabled some mitigation of the problems that have shifted to the atmosphere and lithosphere, though these are beyond the scope of this paper, which assumes a hypothetical worst-case scenario in this regard. Whereas, in Part I, the time period 1993-2005 was considered, this paper is handicapped by the lack of availability of data and is restricted to a much narrower time period: 2002-2006.","COD; Heavy metals; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sludge; Wastewater treatment","COD; Degree of separation; Environmental loads; Higher-degree; Industrial sector; Material Flow; Netherlands; Sludge; Source control; Time periods; Treatment efficiency; Worst case scenario; Biochemical oxygen demand; Eutrophication; Global warming; Heavy metals; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Separation; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Water treatment plants; Chemicals removal (water treatment); heavy metal; nitrogen; phosphorus; chemical oxygen demand; eutrophication; global warming; heavy metal; hydrosphere; lithosphere; phosphorus; pollutant removal; pollutant source; pollution control; separation; sludge; toxicology; waste treatment; wastewater; article; atmosphere; environmental impact; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; lithosphere; Norway; waste water management; water pollution; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Industrial Waste; Models, Chemical; Norway; Rheology; Soil Pollutants; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Industrial Waste; Soil Pollutants; Water, 7732-18-5; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"www.ssb.no, Oslo Accessed April 2009Aquateam - Norsk Vannteknologisk senter AS, Tungmetaller og organiske miljøgifter i innløps-og utløpsvann fra kommunale renseanlegg i 2006 (Heavy metals and organic pollutants in the influent to and effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants in 2006), Oslo, Norway, 2006) (In Norwegian)Smith, T., Stave, S.E., Ressursinnsats utslipp og rensing i den kommunale avløpsektoren, (Resource inputs, discharge and cleaning in the municipal sewage sector) (2001) Statistics Norway, , Oslo In Norwegian; Kampschreur, M.J., Nico, C.J.T., Kleerebezem, R., Picioreanu, C., Jetten, M.S.M., Van Loosdrecht, M.C.M., Effect of dynamic process conditions on nitrogen oxides emission from a nitrifying culture (2008) Environ.
