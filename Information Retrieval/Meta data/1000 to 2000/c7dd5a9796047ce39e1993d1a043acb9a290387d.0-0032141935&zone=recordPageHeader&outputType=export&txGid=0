In particular, their contribution to global warming is under scrutiny from customers, regulators and pressure groups. This paper provides a comparison of the global warming and other impacts associated with two possible replacements for Halon 1301 (a banned fire extinguishant), namely an 'in-kind' compound CF3CHFCF3 (HFC-227ea) and a 'not-in-kind' blend of nitrogen, argon and carbon dioxide (IG-541). The impacts associated with the manufacture and deployment of the HFC-227ea are found to be substantially greater than those of the inert gas mixture designed for the same fire-extinguishing duty. The impacts during manufacture reveal an important issue for the widely used measure of global warming impact - the so-called Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI). The present work clearly reveals that where impacts associated with manufacture are significant, the scope of the TEWI analysis needs to cover the manufacturing process if it is to be meaningful. © Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Global warming; Halon replacements; Life-cycle assessment; TEWI",,,,,,,"Banks, R.E., Part 2: 'In-kind' replacements for Halon fire extinguishants (1994) J Fluorine Chem, 67, pp. 193-203; Fischer, S.K., Tomlinson, J.J., Hughes, P.J., (1984) Energy and Global Warming Impacts of Not-In-Kind and next Generation CFC and HCFC Alternatives, , (AFEAS/US DOE; available from AFEAS Program Office (TEWI-II), The West Tower-Suite 400, 1333 H Street NW, Washington, DC 20005-4740, USA); (1995) Updated Information Sheet Total Global Warming Impact (TEWI); (1995) Climate Change 1994: Radiative Forcing of Climate Change and An Evaluation of the IPCC IS92 Emission Scenarios, , (a) Houghton, J.
