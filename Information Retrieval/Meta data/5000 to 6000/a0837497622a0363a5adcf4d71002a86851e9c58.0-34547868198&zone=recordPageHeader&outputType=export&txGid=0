From wind, H2 would now cost (by electrolysis of water and steam) less than $3 for an amount equivalent in energy to that in a gallon of gasoline (""equivalent""). From solar photovoltaics (pv), H2 would be sinking in price between $8 toward $5 equivalent as the efficiency of solar pv increases toward 20%.11Calculated price estimates stated here include 25% profit and the cost of piping H2 1000 miles. Unless otherwise stated, prices are in 2006$. Solar thermal's present prices offer about one-half the solar pv prices. Prediction of the maximum of the delivery rate of world oil is [Laherre's Oil Production Forecast, 1950-2150. Reprinted with permission from correspondence with William Horvath, U.S. Department of Energy, March 29, 2001] 2010. Future energy sources will develop inexhaustible energies from wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and wave sources. The common media will be hydrogen and electricity. These sources yield energy at around one-half the cost of nuclear fission. Growing corn to make alcohol involves a net loss of energy and need for a heating mechanism.22Growth of the plant fueled by solar light and CO2, forming alcohol involves a heating stage and numerous operatives use fossil fuels, thus introducing CO2. This ruins the ""no CO2"" process. However, it is pointed out in this paper that one could use an excess of the first stage biofuel to provide heat and this would run on CO2 and light, i.e., no net CO2 in burning. It may increase the Greenhouse. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Corn; Hydrogen; Nuclear; Oil; Solar; Wind","Electrolysis; Fission reactions; Gasoline; Global warming; Solar energy; Wind power; Energy sources; Solar photovoltaics; Hydrogen",,,,,,"Nejat Veziroglu, T., Awad, A.H., (1984) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 9, p. 355; Simmons, M.R., (2005) Twilight in the desert, , Wiley, New York p. 348; Gregory, D.D., Ng, D.Y.C., Long, G.M., (1972) On the electrochemistry of cleaner environments, , Plenum, New York; Bockris, JOM., (1980) Energy options, , Halsted Press, New York p. 148-56; Bockris, JOM., (1980) Energy options, , Halsted Press, New York p. 311-14; Bockris, J.OM., Bevan, J., Badwall, S., Electrode kinetics of evolution and dissolution of oxygen at Urania-Zirconia interfaces (1980) Acta Electrochim, 25, p. 115; Pound, B.G., Bevan, D.J.M., Bockris, J.OM., Electrolysis of steam during uranium oxide electrodes (1980) Int J Hydrogen, 6, p. 473; Murphy, O., Gutman, F., Electrochemical splitting of water (1983) Modern aspects of electrochemistry, 15, pp. 1-82. , White R., Bockris JOM., and Conway B.E.
