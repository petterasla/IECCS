The aim of this study was to improve the thermal efficiency of fuel production and electricity generation by dry coal feed gasification. The primary cause of thermal efficiency loss is steam use in a water-gas shift reactor. The shift reactor, installed downstream from the gasifier, uses a catalyst to adjust the H2/CO ratio of the syngas. We have proposed a new process in which water is injected at the outlet of the gasifier and is vaporized to enhance the extent of the shift reaction. This process utilizes the high temperature of the syngas, which is sufficient for the shift reaction to occur without a catalyst. We have developed a model that incorporates the shift reaction velocity to evaluate our proposed process. In an optimized 5-stage water supply case, we found that the CO conversion reaches 9.9% at a water/syngas ratio of 0.14 mol/mol (water/CO = 0.25 mol/mol); the CO conversion needed for dimethyl ether production is 31%. This new process can improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of coal gasification. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 capture; Coal gasification; IGCC; Shift reaction","CO conversion; Coal feed; Dimethyl ethers; Electricity generation; Fuel production; Gasifiers; High temperature; IGCC; Shift reactions; Simulation studies; Syn-gas; Thermal efficiency; Water-gas shifts; Carbon dioxide; Carbonization; Catalysts; Coal; Coal gasification; Efficiency; Electric generators; Ethers; Fuels; Gas producers; Global warming; Synthesis gas; Water supply; Water injection; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; carbon sequestration; catalysis; coal; coal processing; efficiency measurement; electricity generation; emission control; ether; gas; global warming; high temperature; production cost; reaction kinetics; reaction rate; vaporization; water",,,,,,"Yamashita, K., Barreto, L., Energyplexes for the 21st century: coal gasification for co-producing hydrogen, electricity and liquid fuels (2005) Energy, 30, pp. 2453-2473; Beer, J.M., High efficiency electric power generation: the environmental role (2007) Prog Energ Combust Sci, pp. 107-134; Franco, A., Diaz, A.R., The future challenges for "" clean coal technologies"": joining efficiency increase and pollutant emission control (2009) Energy, pp. 348-354; Ordorica-Garcia, G., Douglas, P., Croiset, E., Zheng, L., Technoeconomic evaluation of IGCC power plants for CO2 avoidance (2006) Energy Convers Manage, 47, pp. 2250-2259; Huang, Y., Rezvain, S., McIlveen-Wright, D., Minchener, A., Hewitt, N., Techno-economic study of CO2 capture and storage in coal fired oxygen fed entrained flow IGCC power plants (2008) Fuel Process Technol, 89, pp. 916-925; Descamps, C., Bouallou, C., Kanniche, M., Efficiency of an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant including CO2 removal (2008) Energy, 33, pp. 874-881; Odeh, N.A., Cockerill, T.T., Life cycle GHG assessment of fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and storage (2008) Energy Policy, 36, pp. 367-380; Martelli, E., Kreutz, T., Consonni, S., Comparison of coal IGCC with and without CO2 capture and storage: shell gasification with standard vs. partial water quench (2008) Energy Procedia; Graven, W.M., Long, F.J., Kinetics and mechanisms of the 2 opposing reactions of equilibrium CO + H2O = CO2 + H2 (1954) J Am Chem Soc, 76, pp. 2602-2607; Tingey, G.L., Kinetics of water-gas equilibrium reaction.
