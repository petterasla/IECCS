Box 1, Aspendale, VIC 3195, Australia","A multi-millennial simulation with the CSIRO Mark 2 coupled global climatic model has been used to determine whether climatic conditions approximate to those experienced by the medieval Norse settlers in Greenland could be identified. The aim of this analysis was to see whether such conditions could be replicated by the natural climatic variability in this unforced simulation, in order to counteract claims that the current observed global warming is merely another example of this type of climatic regime. This view has been expressed in the media in an attempt to refute the existence of a CO2-induced global warming. A 291-year period of above-average temperature followed by a 41-year cooler period were identified in one millennium of the simulation, and subsequently used as an analogue of conditions representative of the time of the Norse settlements. Considerable interannual variability existed in both these periods, but with noticeable positive and negative surface temperature anomalies in the warm and cold periods respectively. Thus the warm period was not a time of uniform benign conditions. Above-average precipitation was also associated with the warm period, and these climatic conditions would have enhanced pasture growth and hay production (the only crop the Norse produced) thereby sustaining the livelihood of the Norse Greenlanders. The climatic conditions associated with the cold period in the model were probably sufficient to limit the survival prospects of the settlers, especially when other, probably more critical, deleterious factors are taken into account. The temperature anomalies replicated in the simulation are similar to the limited proxy data, but may be smaller in magnitude: nevertheless they appear to be sufficiently large to have affected the viability of the Norse Greenlanders. After considering possible climatic mechanisms that could have contributed to these warm and cold periods it was concluded that they are simply a consequence of stochastic influences generated by nonlinear processes in the simulation. Thus this simulation provides no support for the contention that the current global warming is a manifestation of conditions prevailing during the Norse settlements in Greenland. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.",,"Average temperature; Climatic conditions; Climatic models; Climatic regimes; Greenland; Interannual variability; Natural climatic variability; Nonlinear process; Proxy data; Surface temperature anomalies; Temperature anomaly; Agriculture; Climatology; Global warming; carbon dioxide; climate conditions; climate modeling; climate variation; global warming; indigenous population; settlement history; temperature anomaly; Arctic; Greenland",,,,,,"Barlow, L.K., Sadler, J.P., Ogilvie, A.E.J., Buckland, P.C., Amorosi, T., Ingimundarson, J.H., Skidmore, P., McGovern, T.H., Interdisciplinary investigations of the end of the Norse Western Settlement in Greenland (1997) Holocene, 7, pp. 489-499; Bertgthorsson, P., Sensitivity of Icelandic agriculture to climatic variations (1985) Clim Change, 7, pp. 111-127; Briffa, K.R., Osborn, T.J., Schweingruber, F.H., Large-scale temperature inferences from tree rings: A review (2004) Glob Planet Change, 40, pp. 11-26; Bromwich, D.H., Chen, Q.-S., Bai, L.-E., Cassano, E.N., Li, Y., Modeled precipitation variability over the Greenland ice sheet (2001) J Geophys Res, 106 D24 (33), pp. 891-833+908; Buckland, P.C., Amorosi, T., Barlow, L.K., Dugmore, A.J., Mayewski, P.A., McGovern, T.H., Ogilvie, A.E.J., Skidmore, P., Bioarchaeological and climatological evidence for the fate of Norse Farmers in medieval Greenland (1996) Antiquity, 70, pp. 88-96; Cobb, K.M., Charles, C.D., Cheng, H., Edwards, R.L., El Nino/Southern oscillation and tropical Pacific climate during the last millennium (2003) Nature, 424, pp. 271-276; Collins, M., Osborn, T.J., Tett, S.F.B., Briffa, K.R., Schweingruber, F.H., A comparison of the variability of a climate model with palaeotemperature estimates from a network of tree-ring densities (2002) J Clim, 15, pp. 1497-1515; Cook, E.R., D'Rrigo, R.D., Mann, M.E., A well-verified, multiproxy reconstruction of the winter North Atlantic oscillation index since A.D. 1400 (2002) J Clim, 15, pp. 1754-1764; Dahl-Jensen, D., Mosegaard, K., Gundestrup, N., Clow, G.D., Johnsen, S.J., Hansen, A.W., Balling, N., Past temperatures directly from the Greenland ice sheet (1998) Science, 282, pp. 268-271; Dansgaard, W., Johnsen, S.J., Reeh, N., Gunestrup, N., Clausen, H.B., Hammer, C.U., Climatic changes, Norsemen and modern man (1975) Nature, 255, pp. 24-28; Davies, H.L., Hunt, B.G., The problem of detecting climatic change in the presence of climatic variability (1994) J Meteorol Soc Jpn, 72, pp. 765-771; Dawson, A.G., Elliott, L., Mayewski, P., Lockett, P., Noone, S., Hickey, K., Holt, T., Foster, I., Late-holocene North Atlantic climate ""seesaws"", storminess changes and Greenland ice sheet (GISP2) polaeoclimates (2003) Holocene, 13, pp. 381-392; Diamond, J., (2005) Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail Or Survive, , Australia: Allen Lane; Dugmore, A.J., Keller, C., McGovern, T.H., Norse Greenland settlement: Reflections on climate change, trade, and the contrasting fate of human settlements in the North Atlantic Islands (2007) Arct Anthropol, 44, pp. 12-36; Fischer, H., Mieding, B., A 1,000-yr ice core record of interannual to multidecadal variations in atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic (2005) Clim Dyn, 25, pp. 65-74; Foote, P., Wilson, D.M., (1980) The Viking Achievement: The Society and Culture of Early Medieval Scandinavia, , London: Sidgwick and Jackson; Goosse, H., Renssen, H., (2003) Simulating the Evolution of the Arctic Climate During the Last Millennium, , www.astr.ucl.ac.be/users/hgs/ams-artic./pdf; Goosse, H., Renssen, H., Timmermann, A., Bradley, R.S., Internal and forced climate variability during the last millennium: A model-data comparison using ensemble simulations (2005) Quat Sci Rev, 24, pp. 1345-1360; Gordon, H.B., O'Farrell, S.P., Transient climate change in the CSIRO coupled model with dynamic sea ice (1997) Mon Weather Rev, 125, pp. 875-907; Hanna, E., Valdes, P., Validation of ECMWF (re)analysis surface climate data, 1979-1998, for Greenland and implications for mass balance modelling of the ice sheet (2001) Int J Climatol, 21, pp. 171-195; Hirst, A.C., O'Farrell, S.P., Gordon, H.B., Comparison of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model with and without oceanic eddy induced advection.
