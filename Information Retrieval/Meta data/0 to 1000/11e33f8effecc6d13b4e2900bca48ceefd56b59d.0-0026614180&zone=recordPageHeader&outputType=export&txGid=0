In this article the implications of different policies with respect to control of ozone depleting substances for climate change are analysed, including the proposed substitution by HCFCs and HFCs, carbon tetrachloride and methylchloroform. A special halocarbon module was developed within the framework of RIVM's Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE). IMAGE is a parameterized science based policy model and has been developed to give policy agencies a concise overview of the quantitative aspects of the greenhouse problem, to evaluate various policy options concerning climate change and to serve as a means of communication. It is concluded, from simulations with the halocarbon module, that it is primary importance to achieve a further reduction of the regulated CFCs compared to the Montreal Protocol with compliance by as many countries as possible. From the perspective of the greenhouse effect the inclusion of longer lived halocarbons, such as carbon tetrachloride and HCFC-22 in the protocol comes second. The application of methyl-chloroform, halons and HCFCs and HFCs with lower global warming potentials (GWPs) than HCFC-22 contributes only marginally to the greenhouse effect in comparison with the much more important greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane, ozone and nitrous oxide. Especially if further growth of the total production of HCFCs after completely replacement of the present CFCs can be avoided by using these alternatives with a lower GWP, these substances could therefore be tolerated in a transition period, from the perspective of global warming. © 1992.","alternative; chlorofluorocarbons; global warming; Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect","air pollution; CFC; climatic change; global warming; greenhouse gas; international agreement; man-environment relations; Montreal Protocol; ozone depletion; pollution problem; protocol strengthening; simulation model; chlorofluorocarbon; article; environmental planning; greenhouse effect; meteorology; model; politics; Carbon Dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane; Climate; Comparative Study; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Nitrous Oxide; Ozone; Temperature",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"CMA (Chemical Manufacturers Association), (1987) Production, sales and calculated release of CFC-11 and CFC-12 through 1986, , New Release of the CMA, 18 November 1987, Washington DC; CMA (Chemical Manufacturers Association), (1988) Production, sales and calculated release of CFC-11 and CFC-12 through 1987, , New Release of the CMA, Washington DC; Du, (1989) Fluorocarbon/ozone, , update.
