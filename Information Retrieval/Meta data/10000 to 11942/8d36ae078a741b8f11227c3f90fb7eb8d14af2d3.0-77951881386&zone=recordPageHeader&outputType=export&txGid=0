Using gridded climate reanalysis data, we analyse the air masses and frontal zones of North America in relation to the atmospheric circulation and vegetation productivity. The position of the July Arctic front varies significantly through the period 1948-2007, with a mean position similar to that found by Bryson (1966). The variability of the frontal position can be associated with changes in the general circulation; when the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) are positive (negative), the position of the July Arctic front is further north (south). There is also more spatial variability in the July Arctic frontal position in eastern versus western North America. The location of the frontal zone affects the vegetation through impacts on vegetative production; when the July Arctic front is north (south) of the mean position, the boreal forest and tundra vegetation is more (less) productive. Contrary to other studies that have identified changes in air mass frequency distributions and properties in several regions in response to global warming, we could not find clear evidence of significant changes in the position of the Arctic front in recent years. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.","Air mass; Arctic front; ERA-40; NCEP; North America; Reanalysis","Air mass; Arctic oscillations; Atmospheric circulation; Boreal forests; Frequency distributions; Frontal zones; General circulation; North American; Reanalysis; Southern oscillation index; Spatial variability; Tundra vegetation; Vegetation productivity; Arctic engineering; Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Global warming; Vegetation; air mass; arctic environment; Arctic Oscillation; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric front; boreal forest; boundary layer; frontal feature; Southern Oscillation; spatial variation; summer; tundra; vegetation cover; North America",,,,,,"(2005) Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , ACIA., Cambridge University Press: Cambridge; Barry, R.G., Seasonal location of the Arctic front over North America (1967) Geographical Bulletin, 9, pp. 79-95; Borchert, J.R., The climate of the central North American Grassland (1950) Annals of The Association of American Geographers, 40, pp. 1-22; Bridgman, H.A., Oliver, J.E., (2006) The Global Climate System, , Cambridge University Press: Cambridge; Brinkmann, W.A.R., Development of an airmass-based regional climate change scenario (1993) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 47, pp. 129-136. , DOI: 10.1007/BF00867445; Bryson, R.A., Air masses, streamlines, and the boreal forest (1966) Geographical Review, 8, pp. 228-269; (2003) Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map, , CAVM Team, Scale 1:7500,000, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Map No. 1.
