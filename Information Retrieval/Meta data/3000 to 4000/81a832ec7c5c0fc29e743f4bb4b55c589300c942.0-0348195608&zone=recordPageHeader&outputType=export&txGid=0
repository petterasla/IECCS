Production of phenolics and condensed tannins in boreal woody plants is known to reduce grazing pressure. Their production depends, among other things, on the availability of nutrient resources, especially nitrogen, relative to the availability of assimilates. The carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis (Bryant, Chapin &amp; Klein, 1983) predicts a decrease in the concentration of carbon-based defence compounds with increased availability of nutrients. In a High Arctic heath, I manipulated the carbon-nitrogen balance of polar willow (Salix polaris) in a factorial, multi-level fertilizing and shading experiment. Other plots were subject to elevated temperature. After 2 years, shading and, to a lesser extent, fertilization had caused an increase in nitrogen concentrations in the leaves, which were highly and negatively correlated with lower total phenolic and condensed tannin concentrations. Elevated temperature caused no such effects, but increased growth significantly, while shading reduced shoot biomass, and fertilization had no detectable effect. These results are consistent with the CNB hypothesis. On the basis of this study it seems unlikely, however, that environmental modifications due to global climate change will have a major impact on defence chemistry, as very high shading (&gt; 70%) and fertilization levels (&gt; 1.5 g m-2 year-1) were needed to produce significant deviations from controls.","Arctic; Carbon-nutrient balance; Condensed tannins; Fertilization; Phenolics; Secondary compounds; Shading","carbon; herbivory; nitrogen; nutrient budget; plant defense; shading; Salix; Salix polaris",,,,,,"Bryant, J.P., Chapin, F.S., Klein, D.R., Carbon/nutrient balance of boreal plants in relation to vertebrate herbivory (1983) Oikos, 40, pp. 357-368; Bryant, J.P., Kuropat, P.J., Selection of winter forage by subarctic browsing vertebrates: The role of plant chemistry (1980) Annal Review of Ecology and Systematics, 11, pp. 261-285; Bryant, J.P., Provenza, F.D., Pastor, J., Reichardt, P.B., Clausen, T.P., duToit, J.T., Interactions between woody plants and browsing mammals mediated by secondary metabolites (1991) Annal Review of Ecology and Systematics, 22, pp. 431-446; Chapin, F.S., The cost of tundra plant structures: Evaluation of concepts and currencies (1989) American Naturalist, 133, pp. 1-19; Chapin, F.S., McKendrick, J.D., Johnson, D.A., Seasonal changes in carbon fractions in Alaskan tundra plants of differing growth forms: Implications for herbivory (1986) Journal of Ecology, 74, pp. 707-731; Chapin, F.S., Schulze, E.D., Mooney, H.A., The ecology and economics of storage in plants (1990) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 21, pp. 423-447; Dormann, C.F., (2001) Global Change, Herbivory and Arctic Plants, , Ph.D. thesis, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen; Dormann, C.F., Skarpe, C., Flowering, growth and defence in the two sexes: Consequences of herbivore exclusion on Salix polaris (2002) Functional Ecology, 16, pp. 649-656; Dormann, C.F., Woodin, S.J., Climate change in the Arctic: Using plant functional types in a meta-analysis of field experiments (2002) Functional Ecology, 16, pp. 4-17; Edenius, L., Browsing by moose on Scots pine in relation to plant resource availability (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 2261-2269; Gebauer, R.L.E., Strain, B.R., Reynolds, J.F., The effect of elevated CO2 and N availability on tissue concentrations and whole plant pools of carbon-based secondary compounds in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) (1998) Oecologia, 113, pp. 29-36; Grime, J.P., Campbell, B.D., Growth rate, habitat productivity and plant strategy as predictors of stress response (1991) Response of Plants to Multiple Stresses, pp. 143-159. , H.
