We developed two physical-forcing scenarios: (1) physical effects on phytoplankton biomass and (2) simultaneous physical effects on phytoplankton biomass and predator recruitment. We simulated the effects of climate-anomaly pulses, climate cycles, and global warming. Pulses caused oscillations to propagate through the ecosystem; cycles affected the shapes of these oscillations; and warming caused trends. We concluded that biomass trajectories of single populations at middle and upper trophic levels cannot be used to detect bottom-up effects, that direct physical effects on predator recruitment can be the dominant source of interannual variability in pelagic ecosystems, that such direct effects may dampen top-down control by fisheries, and that predictions about the effects of climate change may be misleading if fishing mortality is not considered. Predictions from ecosystem models are sensitive to the relative strengths of indirect and direct physical effects on middle and upper trophic levels.",,"climate forcing; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; pelagic ecosystem; trophic level; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Animalia",,,,,,"Barber, R.T., Chavez, F.P., Biological consequences of El Niño (1983) Science, 222, pp. 1203-1210. , Wash., D.C; Barber, R.T., Chávez, F.P., Ocean variability in relation to living resources during the 1982-83 El Niño (1986) Nature (Lond.), 319, pp. 279-285; Barber, R.T., Sanderson, M.P., Lindley, S.T., Chai, F., Newton, J., Trees, C.C., Foley, D.G., Chavez, F.P., Primary productivity and its regulation in the equatorial Pacific during and following the 1991-1992 El Niño (1996) Deep-Sea Res.
