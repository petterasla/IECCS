We have developed a new orbital chronology for Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 690 (Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean) by using spectral analysis of high-resolution geochemical records. The LPTM interval spans 11 precessional cycles yielding a duration of 210 to 220 k.y. The δ13C anomaly associated with the LPTM has a magnitude of about -2.5‰ to -3‰; we show that about -2‰ of the excursion occurs within two steps that each were less than 1000 yr in duration. The remainder developed through a series of steps over ~52 k.y. The timing of these steps is consistent with a series of nearly catastrophic releases of methane from gas hydrates, punctuated by intervals of relative equilibria between hydrate dissociation and carbon burial. Further, we are able to correlate the records between ODP Sites 690 and 1051 (western North Atlantic) on the scale of 21 k.y. cycles, which demonstrates that the details of the δ13C excursion are recognizable between distant sites. Comparison of cycle records at Sites 690 and 1051 suggests that sediment representing the interval ~30 k.y. just prior to and at the onset of the LPTM are missing in the latter location. This unconformity probably resulted from slope failure accompanying methane hydrate dissociation within 10 k.y. of the start of the LPTM.","Cyclostratigraphy; Globalwarming; Paleoceanography; Paleocene; XRF scanner","climate change; cyclostratigraphy; global warming; paleoceanography; Paleocene; paleoclimate; thermohaline circulation",,,,,,"Aubry, M.-P., Berggren, W.A., Stott, L., Sinha, A., The upper Paleocene-lower Eocene stratigraphic record and the Paleocene-Eocene boundary carbon isotope excursion: Implications for geochronology (1996) Correlation of the Early Paleogene in Northwest Europe, 101, pp. 353-380. , Knox R.W., et al., eds., Geological Society [London] Special Publication; Bains, S., Corfield, R.M., Norris, R.D., Mechanisms of climate warming at the end of the Paleocene (1999) Science, 285, pp. 724-727; Berggren, W.A., Kent, D.V., Swisher III, C.C., Aubry, M.P., A revised Cenozoic geochronology and chronostratigraphy (1995) Geochronology, Timescales, and Stratigraphic Correlation; Framework for an Historical Geology, 54, pp. 129-212. , Berggren W.A., et al., eds., SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology) Special Publication; Bralower, T.J., Thomas, D.J., Zachos, J.C., Hirschmann, M.M., Röhl, U., Sigurdsson, H., Thomas, E., Whitney, D.L., High-resolution records of the late Paleocene thermal maximum and circum-Carribbean volcanisms: Is there a causal link?
