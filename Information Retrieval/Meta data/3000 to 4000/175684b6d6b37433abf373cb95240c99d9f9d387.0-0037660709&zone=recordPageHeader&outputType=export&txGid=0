The land and sea temperature series follow similar patterns and are strongly correlated but with no obvious lead/lag either way. This cooling is significantly inversely correlated with an increased phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the past few decades (r = -0.76), and will probably have significantly affected the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",,"Cooling; Data reduction; Global warming; Sea-surface temperatures; Geophysics; cooling; global change; ice sheet; mass balance; North Atlantic Oscillation; sea surface temperature; Greenland",,,,,,"Abdalati, W., Preface (2001) J.
