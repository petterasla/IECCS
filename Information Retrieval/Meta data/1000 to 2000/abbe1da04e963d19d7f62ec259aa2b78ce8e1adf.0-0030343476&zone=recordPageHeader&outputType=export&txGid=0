This is the primary cause of the climatic constraints observed in the zone, such as low temperatures, a short growing season, frosts during the growing season, long and cold winters and thick snow cover. In Finland, the length of the growing season varies from 180 days in the south (60°N) to 120 days in the north (70°N). Consequently, the growing time for crops from sowing to ripening is also short, which limits their ability to produce high yields. The most advanced forms of farming in the high-latitude zone are encountered towards the south in Northern Europe, central Siberia and the prairies of Canada, i.e. mainly in the phytogeographical hemiboreal zone where the effective temperature sum is higher than 1200°Cd. Conditions for agriculture then deteriorate gradually further north with the cooling of the climate, and this is reflected as an increase in cattle rearing at the expense of grain cultivation. In northern Europe farming is practised as far north as to the Arctic Circle, at about 66°N latitude. In North America, fields extend to about 55°N. In Asia, there are few fields north of 60°N. Finland is the most northern agricultural country in the world, with all its field area, about 2.5 million hectares, located north of latitude 60°N. Changes in the climate and atmospheric CO2 predicted for the future are likely to have a strong influence, either beneficial or disadvantageous, on the conditions for growth in northern areas where the annual mean temperature is 5°C or less.","Circumpolar zone; Crop production; Finland; Growing season; Growth conditions; Solar radiation; Temperature sum; Winter damage",,,,,,,"Carter, T.R., Developing scenarios of atmosphere, weather and climate for northern regions (1996) Agricultural and Food Science in Finland, 5 (THIS ISSUE), pp. 235-249; Saarikko, R.A., Niemi, K.J., Assessing the risks and uncertainties of regional crop potential under a changing climate in Finland (1996) Agricultural and Food Science in Finland, 5 (THIS ISSUE), pp. 329-350; Hämet-Ahti, L., The boreal zone and its biotic subdivision (1981) Fennia, 159, pp. 69-75; Houghton, J.T., Climate change 1992 (1992) The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press. 200 p; Houghton, J.T., Climate change 1994 (1995) Radiative Forcing of Climate Change and An Evaluation of the IPCC 1992 Emission Scenarios, , Cambridge University Press. 339 p; Kettunen, L., Mukula, J., Pohjonen, V., Rantanen, O., Varjo, U., The effects of climatic variations on agriculture in Finland (1988) The Impact of Climatic Variations on Agriculture.
