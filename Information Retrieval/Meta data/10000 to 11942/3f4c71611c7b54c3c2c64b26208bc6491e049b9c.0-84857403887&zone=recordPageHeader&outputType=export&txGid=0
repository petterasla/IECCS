Aqueous extract of dried leaves of Eucalyptus citriodora in various concentrations were tested on the seedling growth of Vigna mungo (L) Hepper to standardize the optimum doses.","Biochemical impact; Biofertilizer; Eucalyptus citriodora; Seedling growth; Vigna mungo","Corymbia citriodora; Eucalyptus; Vigna mungo",,,,,,"Abern, L., Lowe, K., Morreus, A., Park, G., Price, R., A strategy for covering biodiversity in goldfields bioregion, Victoria, Vol. I: An overview (2001), Department of Natural Resources and Environment, Melbourne VictoriaAdams, R., Simmons, D., (2000) Survival, Health and Recruitment of Eucalyptus Crenulata (Buxton-Gum)"" Peakin University, , School of Ecology and Environment, Melbourne; Ahlawat, K.A., Vimla, Y., Alleopathic jintraction of Populous deltoides leaf leachates with some crop plants (2008) JIBS, 87 (3-4), pp. 145-146; Al-Mousawi, A.H., Al-Naib, F.A.G., Allelopathic effects of Eucalyptus microtheca F (1975) Muel J Univ Kuwait (Sci), 2, pp. 59-66; Al-Mousawi, A.H., Al-Naib, F.A.G., Allelopathic effects of Eucalyptus microtheca: Identificatiion and characterization of the phenolic compounds in Eucalyptus microtheca (1976) J Univ Kuwait (Sci), 3, pp. 83-88; Al-Subai, Horwath, I., The effect of alternating period of light and darkness on tissues of Phaseolus vulgaris cultivar (1981) Acta Univ.
