After acclimation in hydroponics at ambient (25°C) RZT for three weeks, seedlings were exposed to sub-optimal (15°C and 20°C) and ambient RZTs. After one week, plants were harvested and then growth and mineral elements were analyzed. The highest shoot and root biomass was at 25°C and lowest at 15°C RZT. In shoots, the highest concentrations of all elements, except for nickel (Ni), were at 25°C RZT. At lower RZTs, the reductions in concentrations were more evident especially for trace elements and heavy metals. Except for magnesium (Mg), the highest root concentrations were at 15°C RZT for all essential elements. Unlike other non-essential elements, the highest cadmium (Cd) and cobalt (Co) concentrations in roots were at 25°C RZT. The shoot/root ratios of almost all elements were affected by sub-optimal RZTs. Only manganese (Mn) and Co showed increased shoot/root ratio at sub-optimal RZTs; and this ratio decreased for other elements. Nickel in shoots and Mn, Co and Cd in roots tended to be negatively correlated with most other elements (either, essential or non-essential) in each respective organ. The present study showed that RZT significantly changed the ion profile of L. japonicus and suggests possible connection between global warming and phytoaccumulation of heavy metals, especially in temperate regions, since most metals tended to accumulate in shoots at higher RZT. © 2011 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Element interactions; Heavy metal phyto-accumulation; Ionome; Principal component analysis; Root-zone temperature","Lotus corniculatus var. japonicus",,,,,,"Adebooye, O.C., Schmitz-Eiberger, M., Lankes, C., Noga, G.J., Inhibitory effects of sub-optimal root zone temperature on leaf bioactive components, photosystem II (PS II) and minerals uptake in Trichosanthes cucumerina L.
