The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the magnitude of diurnal and seasonal variation in CH4 net flux, (ii) the relationship between the temporally varying flux rates and associated changes in controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and (iii) the contribution of CH4 emission to the ecosystem growing season carbon budget. There was significant diurnal variation in CH4 emission during the peak of the growing season that was strongly correlated with associated changes in solar radiation, latent heat flux, air temperature and ecosystem conductance to water vapor. During days 181-215, nighttime average CH4 efflux was only 47% of the average midday values. The peak value for daily average CH4 emission rate was approximately 80 nmol m-2 s-1 (4.6 mg CH4 m-2 h-1), and seasonal variation in CH4 flux was strongly correlated with changes in soil temperature. Integrated over the entire measurement period [days 144-269 (late May-late September)], the total CH4 emission was 3.2 g CH4 m-2, which was quite low relative to other wetland ecosystems and to the simultaneous high rate of ecosystem net CO2 sequestration that was measured (18.1 mol CO2 m-2 or 217 g C m-2). We estimate that the negative radiative forcing (cooling) associated with net carbon storage over the life of the peatland (approximately 2200 years) was at least twice the value of positive radiative forcing (warming) caused by net CH4 emission over the last 50 years. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Boreal forest; Canadian Carbon Program; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Fluxnet-Canada; Global warming potential","air temperature; biotic factor; boreal forest; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; climate change; global warming; growing season; radiative forcing; seasonal variation; soil temperature; water vapor; Canada",,,,,,"Aubinet, M., Grelle, A., Ibrom, A., et al, Estimates of the annual net carbon and water exchange of forests: the EUROFLUX methodology (2000) Advances in Ecological Research, 30, pp. 113-176; Baldocchi, D.D., Assessing the eddy covariance technique for evaluating carbon dioxide exchange rates of ecosystems: past, present and future (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 479-492; Baldocchi, D.D., Hicks, B.B., Meyers, T.D., Measuring biosphere-atmosphere exchanges of biologically related gases with micrometeorological methods (1988) Ecology, 69, pp. 1331-1340; Barr, A.G., Black, T.A., Hogg, E.H., Kljun, N., Morgenstern, K., Nesic, N., Inter-annual variability in the leaf area index of a boreal aspen-hazelnut forest in relation to net ecosystem production (2004) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 126, pp. 237-255; Brix, H., Sorrell, B.K., Orr, P.T., Internal pressurization and convective gas flow in some emergent freshwater macrophytes (1992) Limnology and Oceanography, 37, pp. 1420-1433; Bubier, J.L., Moore, T.R., An ecological perspective on methane emissions from northern wetlands (1994) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 9, pp. 460-464; Chanton, J.P., Dacey, J.W.H., Effects of vegetation on methane flux, reservoirs, and isotopic composition (1991) Trace Gas Emissions by Plants, pp. 65-92. , Sharkey TD, Holland EA, Mooney HA. eds, Academic Press, San Diego; Christensen, T.R., Ekberg, A., Strom, L., et al, Factors controlling large scale variations in methane emissions from wetlands (2003) Geophysical Research Letters, 30, p. 1414. , doi, 10.1029/2002GL016848; Christensen, T.R., Johansson, T., Olsrud, M., A catchment-scale carbon and greenhouse gas budget of a subarctic landscape (2007) Philosphcial Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series A, 365, pp. 1643-1656; Dacey, J.W.H., Pressurized ventilation in the yellow waterlily (1981) Ecology, 62, pp. 1137-1147; Dunfield, P., Knowles, R., Dumont, R., Moore, T.R., Methane production and consumption in temperate and subarctic peat soils: response to temperature and pH (1993) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 25, pp. 321-326; Evans, J.R., Resolving methane fluxes (2007) New Phytologist, 175, pp. 1-4; (2008), http://climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climatenormals/index_e.html, Environment Canada, Canadian Climate Normals or Averages: 1971-2000.
