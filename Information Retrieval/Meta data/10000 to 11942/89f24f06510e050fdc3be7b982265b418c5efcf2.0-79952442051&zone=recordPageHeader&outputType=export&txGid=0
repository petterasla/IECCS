Attention has largely focussed on C trace gases, and less is known about the impacts of agricultural conversion on N 2O or global warming potential. We report greenhouse gas fluxes (CH 4, CO 2, N 2O) from a drained peatland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California, USA currently managed as a rangeland (that is, pasture). This ecosystem was a net source of CH 4 (25.8 ± 1.4 mg CH 4-C m -2 d -1) and N 2O (6.4 ± 0.4 mg N 2O-N m -2 d -1). Methane fluxes were comparable to those of other managed temperate peatlands, whereas N 2O fluxes were very high; equivalent to fluxes from heavily fertilized agroecosystems and tropical forests. Ecosystem scale CH 4 fluxes were driven by ""hotspots"" (drainage ditches) that accounted for less than 5% of the land area but more than 84% of emissions. Methane fluxes were unresponsive to seasonal fluctuations in climate and showed minimal temporal variability. Nitrous oxide fluxes were more homogeneously distributed throughout the landscape and responded to fluctuations in environmental variables, especially soil moisture. Elevated CH 4 and N 2O fluxes contributed to a high overall ecosystem global warming potential (531 g CO 2-C equivalents m -2 y -1), with non-CO 2 trace gas fluxes offsetting the atmospheric ""cooling"" effects of photoassimilation. These data suggest that managed Delta peatlands are potentially large regional sources of greenhouse gases, with spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture modulating the relative importance of each gas for ecosystem global warming potential. © 2011 The Author(s).","agricultural conversion; carbon dioxide; drained temperate peatland; global warming potential; management; methane; nitrous oxide; Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta","agricultural emission; carbon dioxide; global warming; greenhouse gas; hot spot; methane; nitrous oxide; pasture; peatland; rangeland; soil moisture; California; Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; United States",,,,,,"Baldocchi, D.D., Assessing the eddy covariance technique for evaluating carbon dioxide exchange rates of ecosystems: past, present and future (2003) Glob Change Biol, 9, pp. 479-492; Barnard, R., Leadley, P.W., Hungate, B.A., Global change, nitrification, and denitrification: a review (2005) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 19, pp. 1-13; Bateman, E.J., Baggs, E.M., Contributions of nitrification and denitrification to N 2O emissions from soils at different water-filled pore space (2005) Biol Fertil Soils, 41, pp. 379-388; Belyea, L.R., Baird, A.J., Beyond ""The limits to peat bog growth"": cross-scale feedback in peatland development (2006) Ecol Monogr, 76, pp. 299-322; Billett, M.F., Palmer, S.M., Hope, D., Deacon, C., Storeton-West, R., Hargreaves, K.J., Flechard, C., Fowler, D., Linking land-atmosphere-stream carbon fluxes in a lowland peatland system (2004) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 18, pp. 1-12; Blank, R.R., Youn, J.A., Influence of the exotic invasive crucifer, Lepidium latifolium. on soil properties and elemental cycling (2002) Soil Sci, 167, pp. 821-829; Carroll, P., Crill, P., Carbon balance of a temperate poor fen (1997) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 11, pp. 349-356; Charman, D., (2002) Peatlands and Environmental Change, , Chichester: Wiley; Chen, Y., McNamara, N.P., Dumont, M.G., Bodrossy, L., Stralis-Pauese, N., Murrell, J.C., The impact of burning and Calluna removal on below-ground methanotroph diversity and activity in a peatland soil (2008) Appl Soil Ecol, 40, pp. 291-298; Cocks, T., Jenssen, R., Stewart, A., Wilson, I., Shields, T., (1998) The HyMap (TM) Airborne Hyperspectral Sensor: The System Calibration and Performance, , Versailles: European Assoc Remote Sensing Laboratories; Detto, M., Katul, G.G., Simplified expressions for adjusting higher-order turbulent statistics obtained from open path gas analyzers (2007) Boundary-Layer Meteorol, 122, pp. 205-216; Detto, M., Baldocchi, D.D., Katul, G.G., Scaling properties of biologically active scalar concentration fluctuations in the surface boundary layer over a managed peatland (2010) Boundary-Layer Meteorol, 136, pp. 407-430; Detto, M., Verfaillie, J., Anderson, F., Xu, L., Baldocchi, D.D., Comparing laser-based open- and closed-path gas analyzers to measure methane fluxes using the eddy covariance method (2010), Agric For Meteorol (in review)Deverel, S.J., Rojstaczer, S., Subsidence of agricultural lands in the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta, California: role of aqueous and gaseous carbon fluxes (1996) Water Resour Res, 32, pp. 2359-2367; Deverel, S.J., Leighton, D.A., Finlay, M.R., Processes affecting agricultural drainwater quality and organic carbon loads in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (2007) San Francisco Estuary Watershed Sci, 5, pp. 1-25; Dise, N.B., Peatland response to global change (2009) Science, 326, pp. 810-811; Drexler, J.Z., de Fontaine, C.S., Deverel, S.J., The legacy of wetland drainage on the remaining peat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA (2009) Wetlands, 29, pp. 372-386; (2009) Land Use Survey Data, , DWR., California Department of Water Resources, Division of Planning and Local Assistance; Fiedler, S., Holl, B.S., Jungkunst, H.F., Methane budget of a Black Forest spruce ecosystem considering soil pattern (2005) Biogeochemistry, 76, pp. 1-20; Flessa, H., Wild, U., Klemisch, M., Pfadenhauer, J., Nitrous oxide and methane fluxes from organic soils under agriculture (1998) Eur J Soil Sci, 49, pp. 327-335; Florsheim, J.L., Dettinger, M.D., Climate and floods still govern California levee breaks (2007) Geophys Res Lett, 34, pp. 1-5. , L22403; Forster, P., Ramaswamy, V., Artaxo, P., Al, E., Chapter 2.
