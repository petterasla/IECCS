The measurements and calculations are made in comparison with a nearby open agricultural location or ""control site"". The measurement program was conducted during the summer of 1981 in Davis, CA, and consisted of a series of paired observations in which simultaneous measurements were made at a control site, located in a nearby rural area, and one suburban site at a time. Results indicate that this methodology was generally successful. The various suburban sites were as often cooler than the rural site as they were warmer. In one case, a suburban site was found to be substantially cooler, averaging 7.38°C over a 5 day period, than the rural site. This special case was observed to be associated with unusually dry environmental air resulting in large evaporative cooling in the plant canopy. Comparison between the suburban temperature deficit and the physical nature of the various sites reveals that canopy height explained most of the variance of this data set. Two generally important mechanisms are hypothesized to be operating in this system: the effect of canopy size on turbulent mixing and on site shading, especially of paved areas. A simple energy balance model was applied to study the processes that control the daytime suburban temperature deficit. In particular, it is found that suburban sites can be as cool as observed when the following conditions are obtained: low-canopy humidity, large canopy size, low wind speed and high radiation load. The model simulated the overall average suburban temperature deficit of all sites for physically reasonable choices of model parameters. It is pointed out that the fact that suburban areas may be cooler than surrounding rural areas may have significance to the problem of assessing the role of the urban heat island in relation to possible global warming. © 1993.","observations; urban canopy; Urban climate","Evapotranspiration; Geographical regions; Greenhouse effect; Heat storage; Mathematical models; Temperature measurement; Daytime suburban temperature deficit; Energy balance model; Microclimatic variations; Suburban environment; Urban canopy; Urban heat island phenomenon; Climatology; air quality; article; comparative study; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; meteorology; methodology; microclimate; radiation exposure; rural area; summer; urban area; wind; microclimate; suburban environment; temperature deficit; urban canopy",,,,,,"Brooks, Pruitt, Nielsen, Investigation of energy and mass transfer near the ground including the influences of the soil-plant-atmosphere system (1963) Final Report on contract DA-36-SC-80334, , Univeristy of California, Davis; Businger, Flux-profile relationship in the atmospheric surface layer (1971) Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 28, pp. 181-189; Halstead, Richman, Covey, Merryman, A preliminary report on the design of a computer for micrometeorology (1957) Journal of Meteorology, 14, pp. 308-325; Hansen, Lacis, Sun and dust versus greenhouse gases: an assessment of their relative holes in global climate change (1990) Nature, 346, pp. 713-719; Hatfield, Carroll, Flocchini, Smietana, Jr., Hamilton, Kennedy, Tables of hourly, daily and monthly solar radiation and meteorological data for Davis, California—1981 (1982) Report DOE grant DE-FG03-79ET20187, , Dept of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis, Available from the; Howard, (1833) Climate of London Deduced from Meteorological Observations, , 3rd edn., Harvey & Darton, London; Jones, Grosiman, Coughlan, Plummer, Yang, Karl, Assessment of urbanization effects of surface air temperature over land (1990) Nature, 347, pp. 169-172; Kerr, Global temperature hits record again (1991) Science, 251, pp. 274-275; Landsberg, (1981) The Urban Climate, , Academic Press, New York; Lindzen, Some coolness concerning global warming (1990) Bull.
