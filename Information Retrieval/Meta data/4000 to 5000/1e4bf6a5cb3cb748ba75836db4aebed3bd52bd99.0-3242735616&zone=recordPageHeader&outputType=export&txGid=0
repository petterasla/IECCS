Having a short atmospheric lifetime is very important for the potential substitutes that may also induce ozone depletion and yield high global warming gases to be put in use. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies were presented for their lifetimes aided by the quantum chemistry parameters including net charges, Mulliken overlaps, E HOMO and ELUMO based on the density functional theory (DFT) at B3PW91 level, and the C-H bond dissociation energy based on AM1 calculations. Outstanding features of the logistic mapping, a simple chaotic system, especially the inherent ability to search the space of interest exhaustively have been utilized. The chaotic mapping aided genetic algorithm artificial neural network training scheme (CGANN) showed better performance than the conventional genetic algorithm ANN training when the structure of the data set was not favorable. The lifetimes of HFCs and HCs appeared to be greatly dependent on their energies of the highest occupied molecular orbitals. The perference of the RMSRE comparing to RMSE as objective function of ANN training was better for the samples of interest with relatively short lifetimes. C 2H6 and C3H8 as potential green substitutes of CFCs present relatively short lifetimes.","Artificial neural network; Atmospheric lifetime; Chaos; Genetic algorithm; HCFCs; HFCs","alkane; halogenated hydrocarbon; algorithm; article; artificial neural network; atmosphere; chemical model; chemistry; comparative study; half life time; nonlinear system; quantitative structure activity relation; Algorithms; Alkanes; Atmosphere; Half-Life; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Models, Chemical; Neural Networks (Computer); Nonlinear Dynamics; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship",,"Alkanes; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated",,,,"Molina, M.J., Rowland, F.S., Stratospheric sink for chlorofluoromethanes: Chlorine atom catalyzed destruction of ozone (1974) Nature, 249, pp. 810-814; Farman, J.C., Gardiner, B.G., Shanklin, J.D., Large losses of total ozone in antarctica reveal seasonal ClO x/NOx interaction (1985) Nature, 315, pp. 207-210; (1987) Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, p. 15. , United Nations Environmental Programme, New York; (1990) Amendment to Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, , United Nations Environmental Programme, London; Wallington, T.J., Schneider, W.F., Worsnop, D.R., Nielsen, O.J., Sehested, J., Debruyn, W.J., Shorter, J.A., The environmental impact of CFC replacements - HFCs and HCFCs (1994) Environ.
