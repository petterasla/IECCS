The network, owing to its limited number of gauges and poor geographical distribution complicated further by unknown vertical land movements, is ill suited for measuring the GMSL. Yet it remains the only available source for deciphering the sea level rise over the last 100 a. The poor sampling characteristics of the tide gauge network have necessitated the usage of statistical inference. A linear optimal estimator based on the Gauss-Markov theorem seems well suited for the job. This still leaves a great deal of freedom in choosing the estimator. GMSL is poorly correlated with tide gauge measurements because the small uniform rise and fall of sea level are masked by the far larger regional signals. On the other hand, a regional mean sea level (RMSL) is much better correlated with the corresponding regional tide gauge measurements. Since the GMSL is simply the sum of RMSLs, the problem is transformed to one of estimating the RMSLs from regional tide gauge measurements. Specifically for the annual heating and cooling cycle, we separate the global ocean into 10°-latitude bands and compute for each 10°-latitude band the estimator that predicts its RMSL from tide gauges within. In the future, the statistical correlations are to be computed using satellite altimetry. However, as a first attempt, we have used numerical model outputs instead to isolate the problem so as not to get distracted by altimetry or tide gauge errors. That is, model outputs for sea level at tide gauge locations of the GLOSS network are taken as tide gauge measurements, and the RMSLs are computed from the model outputs. The results show an estimation error of approximately 2 mm versus an error of 2.7 cm if we simply average the tide gauge measurements to estimate the GMSL, caused by the much larger regional seasonal cycle and mesoscale variation plaguing the individual tide gauges. The numerical model, Los Alamos POP model Run 11 lasting 3 1/4 a, is one of the best eddy-resolving models and does a good job simulating the annual heating and cooling cycle, but it has no global or regional trend. Thus it has basically succeeded in estimating the seasonal cycle of the GMSL. This is still going to be the case even if we use the altimetry data because the RMSLs are dominated by the seasonal cycle in relatively short periods. For estimating the GMSL trend, longer records and low-pass filtering to isolate the statistical relations that are of interest. Here we have managed to avoid the much larger regional seasonal cycle plaguing individual tide gauges to get a fairly accurate estimate of the much smaller seasonal cycle in the GMSL so as to enhance the prospect of an accurate estimate of GMSL trend in short periods. One should reasonably expect to be able to do the same for longer periods during which tide gauges are plagued by much larger regional interannual (e. g., ENSO events) and decadal sea level variations. In the future, with the availability of the satellite altimeter data, we could use the same approach adopted here to estimate the seasonal variations of GMSL and RMSL accurately and remove these seasonal variations accordingly so as to get a more accurate statistical inference between the tide gauge data and the RMSLs (therefore the GMSL) at periods longer than 1 a, i. e., the long-term trend. © The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Global warming; Remote sensing; Sea level",,,,,,,"Anzenhofer, M., Gruber, T., Fully reprocessed ERS-1 altimeter data from 1992 to 1995: Feasibility of the detection of long term sea level change (1998) Journal of Geophysical Research C: Oceans, 103 (3334), pp. 8089-8112; Berge-Nguyen, M.A., Lombard, C.A., Lovel, W., Reconstruction of past decades sea level using thermosteric sea level, tide gauge, satellite altimetry and oceanic reanalysis data (2008) Global and Planetary Change, 62, pp. 1-13; Church, J.A., White, N.J., Coleman, R., Lambeck, K., Mitrovica, J.X., Estimates of the regional distribution of sea level rise over the 1950-2000 period (2004) Journal of Climate, 17 (13), pp. 2609-2625. , DOI 10.1175/1520-0442(2004)017<2609:EOTRDO>2.0.CO;2; Church, J.A., White, N.J., Hunter, J.R., Sea-level rise at tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean islands (2004) Global and Planetary Change, 62, pp. 155-168; Douglas, B.C., Global sea level rise (1991) J Geophys Res, 96, pp. 6981-6992; Dukowicz, J.K., Smith, R.D., Implicit free-surface method for the Bryan-Cox-Semtner ocean model (1994) Journal of Geophysical Research, 99 (C4), pp. 7991-8014. , DOI 10.1029/93JC03455; Fu, L.L., Smith, R.D., Global ocean circulation from satellite altimetry and high-resolution computer simulation (1996) Bull Am Meteor Soc, 11, pp. 2625-2636; Latif, M., Barnett, T.P., Causes of decadal climate variability over the North Pacific and North America (1994) Science, 266 (5185), pp. 634-637; Levitus, S., Antonov, J.I., Boyer, T.P., Stephens, C., Warming of the world ocean (2000) Science, 287 (5461), pp. 2225-2229. , DOI 10.1126/science.287.5461.2225; Liebelt, P.B., (1967) An Introduction to Optimal Estimation, p. 273. , Addison-Wesley; Nerem, R.S., Chambers, D.P., Leuliette, E.W., Mitchum, G.T., Giese, B.S., Variations in global mean sea level associated with the 1997-1998 ENSO event: Implications for measuring long term sea level change (1999) Geophysical Research Letters, 26 (19), pp. 3005-3008. , DOI 10.1029/1999GL002311; Minobe, S., A 50-70 year climatic oscillation over the North Pacific and North America (1997) Geophys Res Letters, 24, pp. 683-686; Schmitz, W.J., On the Interbasin-scale therohaline circulation (1995) Reviews of Geophysics, 33, pp. 151-173; Tai, C.K., Wagner, C., Sampling errors of global mean sea level derived from TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry (2002) NOAA Tech Rep NESDIS, p. 112; Trupin, A., Wahr, J., Spectroscopic analysis of global tide gauge sea level data (1990) Geophys J Int, 100, pp. 441-453","Tai, C.-K.; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Environmental Stellite, Data and Information Service, MD 20746, United States; email: CK.Tai@noaa.gov",,,,,,,,0253505X,,,,"English","Acta Oceanol.
