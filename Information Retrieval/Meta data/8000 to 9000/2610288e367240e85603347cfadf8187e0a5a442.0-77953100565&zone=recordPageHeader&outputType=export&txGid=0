Here we argue that heat stress imposes a robust upper limit to such adaptation. Peak heat stress, quantified by the wetbulb temperature TW, is surprisingly similar across diverse climates today. TW never exceeds 31 °C. Any exceedence of 35 °C for extended periods should induce hyperthermia in humans and other mammals, as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible. While this never happens now, it would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7 °C, calling the habitability of some regions into question. With 11-12 °C warming, such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. Eventual warmings of 12 °C are possible from fossil fuel burning. One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of possible warming can somehow be narrowed. Heat stress also may help explain trends in the mammalian fossil record.","Climate impacts; Global warming; Mammalian physiology; Paleoclimate","adaptation; article; body temperature; climate change; greenhouse effect; heat stress; human; hyperthermia; nonhuman; priority journal; temperature measurement; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Humans; Population Dynamics; Mammalia",,,,,,"Sokolov, A.P., Probabilistic forecast for 21st century climate based on uncertainties in emissions (without policy) and climate parameters (2009) J Climate, 22, pp. 5175-5204; Roe, G.H., Baker, M.B., Why is climate sensitivity so unpredictable?
