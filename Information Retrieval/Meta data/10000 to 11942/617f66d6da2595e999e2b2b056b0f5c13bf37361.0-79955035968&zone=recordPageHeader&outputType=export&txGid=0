From the coupled global climate model (CGCM) simulations with climate change scenario, it is found that the Bjerknes air-sea coupled process is a dominant contributor to the tropical Pacific response. However, it is revealed that most CGCMs commonly simulate the off-equatorial maximum of precipitation change. It is suggested here that the off-equatorial precipitation and the associated equatorial westerlies play a seeding role in triggering an El Niño-like warming response. Atmospheric GCM (AGCM) experiments show that even uniform sea-surface temperature (SST) warming leads to off-equatorial increase in precipitation which brings equatorial westerlies, implying that these non-uniform (off-equatorial) responses can play a seeding role for the El Niño-like warming pattern. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate change; El Niño-like warming; Global warming","Climate change scenarios; Coupled global climate model; Coupled process; Greenhouse warming; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Precipitation change; Sea surface temperatures; Warming patterns; Computer simulation; Experiments; Global warming; Greenhouses; Nickel compounds; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; El Nino; global warming; greenhouse effect; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; westerly",,,,,,"Betts, A.K., Ridgway, W., Climatic equilibrium of the atmospheric convective boundary layer over a tropical ocean (1989) Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 46, pp. 2621-2641; Bjerknes, J., Atmospheric teleconnections from the equatorial Pacific (1969) Monthly Weather Review, 97, pp. 163-172; Boer, G.J., Yu, B., Dynamical aspects of climate sensitivity (2003) Geophysics Research Letters, 30, p. 1135. , DOI:10.1029/2002GL016549; Boer, G.J., Yu, B., Climate sensitivity and response (2003) Climate Dynamics, 20, pp. 415-429; Cane, M., Clement, A.C., Kaplan, A., Kushnir, Y., Pozdnyakov, D., Seager, R., Zebiak, S., Murtugudde, R., Twentieth century sea surface temperature trends (1997) Science, 275, pp. 957-960; Clarke, A.J., Why are surface equatorial ENSO winds anomalously westerly under anomalous large-scale convection?
