It also supports the idea of economic development through the provision of payments to farmers in developing countries for their stewardship and enhancement of ecosystem services. These would be generated by their use of recommended management practices for improved agriculture. The technical potential of C sequestration in soils of terrestrial ecosystems and restoration of peat soils is ~3 Petagram (Pg) C/yr (i.e. 3 × 1015 g=3 × 109 tonnes C/yr) or 50 ppm draw down of atmospheric CO2 by the end of the 21st century by increasing the soil C pool at a rate of 1 Mg/ha/yr. Depending upon climate and other variables, this could increase cereal and food legume production in developing countries by 32 million Mg/yr and roots and tubers by 9 million Mg/yr. It is precisely this strategy which would have received broad political support at the COP-15 meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009 from developing countries, emerging economies and the industrialized world. Addressing the issue of foodinsecurity and global warming through sequestration of C in soils and the biota, along with payments to resource-poor farmers for the ecosystem services rendered, would be a timely win-win strategy. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. &amp; International Society for Plant Pathology 2010.","Carbon trading; Climate change; Food security; Organic matter management; Soil carbon sequestration","agricultural development; agronomy; climate change; developing world; economic development; ecosystem service; emissions trading; food security; peat soil; soil carbon; soil quality; spatiotemporal analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; twenty first century; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden",,,,,,"Aggarwal, R.K., Kumar, P., Power, J.F., Use of crop residue and manure to conserve water and enhance nutrient availability and pearl millet yields in an arid tropical region (1997) Soil Tillage Res, 41, pp. 43-51; Al-Juaied, M., Whitmore, A., (2009) Realistic Cost of Carbon Capture, , Harvard: John F.
