Soil moisture in 0-1000 cm soil layers of 23 kinds of tree and shrub forestlands was measured. Average soil moisture in 0-1000 cm soil profile of the forestlands was 10.84%, obviously lower than soil moisture in local natural grasslands and soil stable moisture. Average soil desic-cation intensity reached a medium level. Maximum soil water use depth was close to or over 1000 cm, and the thickness of desic-cated soil layers in forestlands reached or passed 800 cm. © 2008 Ecological Society of China.","artificial forestlands; Loess Plateau; soil desiccation; soil moisture","artificial ecosystem; desiccation; shrub; soil moisture; soil profile; vegetation structure; water use; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Loess Plateau; Caragana; Caragana microphylla; Hippophae; Hippophae rhamnoides; Kalmia latifolia; Malus x domestica; Pinus tabuliformis; Quercus wutaishanica; Robinia; Sophora; Sophora viciifolia",,,,,,"Li, Y.S., Characters of soil water cycling and its influences on land water cycling of the loess region of China (1983) Acta Ecologica Sinica, 3 (2), pp. 91-101; Han, S.F., Li, Y.S., Shi, Y.J., The characteristics of soil moisture resources on the Loess Plateau (1990) Bulletin of Soil and Water Conservation, 10 (1), pp. 36-43; Yang, W.X., The preliminary discussion on soil desiccation of artificial vegetation in the northern region of China (1996) Scientia of Silvae Sinicae, 32 (1), pp. 78-84; Yu, X.X., Zhang, J.J., Zhu, J.Z., Analysis and evaluation on soil water conditions of conservation forest ecosystem of loess region (1996) Scientia of Silvae Sinicae, 32 (4), pp. 289-296; Wu, Q.X., Yang, W.Z., (1998) The vegetation construction and sustainable development of the Leoss Plateau, , Science Press, Beijing; Hou, Q.C., Han, R.L., Han, S.F., Intitial research on ""dried soil layer"" of artificial forestland and grassland in Loess Plateau (1999) Soil and Water Conservation of China, (5), pp. 11-14; Yang, W.Z., Shao, M.A., (2000) Research on soil water of the Loess Plateau, , Science Press, Beijing; Yang, W.Z., Soil water resources and afforestation in Loess Plateau (2001) Journal of Natural Resources, 16 (5), pp. 433-438; Li, Y.S., Effects of forest on water cycle on the Loess Plateau (2001) Journal of Natural Resources, 16 (5), pp. 427-432; Huang, M.B., Yang, X.M., Li, Y.S., Effect of apple basin regional water cycle in Weibei upland of the Loess Plateau (2001) Acta Geographica Sinica, 56 (1), pp. 5-13; Chen, Y.M., Liang, Y.M., Cheng, J.M., The zonal character of vegetation construction on the Loess Plateau (2002) Acta Phytoecologica Sinica, 26 (3), pp. 339-345; Chen, Y.M., Liu, G.B., Yang, Q.K., Zonal characteristics of artificial forest effecting soil moistureon Loess Plateau (2004) Journal of Natural Resources, 19 (2), pp. 195-200; Mu, X.M., Xu, X.X., Du, F., Impact of artificial forest on soil moisture of the deep soil layer on Loess Plateau (2003) Acta Pedologica Sinica, 40 (2), pp. 210-217; Cheng, J.M., Wan, H.E., Yong, S.P., Soil water dynamic of Hippophae rhammoides in loess hilly region (2003) Acta Botanica Boreali-Occidentalia Sinica, 23 (8), pp. 1352-1356; Cheng, J.M., Wan, H.E., Wang, J., Growth of Caragana microphylla and depletion process of soil water in semi-arid region (2005) Scientia of Silvae Sinicae, 41 (2), pp. 37-41; Wang, L., Shao, M.A., Zhang, Q.F., Distribution and characters of soil dry layer in northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau (2004) Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology, 15 (3), pp. 436-442; Fan, J., Hao, M.D., Shao, M.A., Water consumption of deep soil layers and eco-environmental effects of agricultural ecosystem in the Loess Plateau (2004) Transaction of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 20 (1), pp. 61-64; Wang, J.X., Huang, B.L., Luo, W.X., Compensation and rehabilitation characteristics of soil water dificit at a planted forest site of drought prone Loess Plateau (2004) Acta Ecologica Sinica, 24 (11), pp. 2395-2401; Yang, X.M., Yang, W.Z., Study on soil water balance of shrubland (1998) Research of Soil and Water Conservation, 5 (1), pp. 109-118; Wang, Z.Q., Liu, B.Y., Xu, C.D., Fu, J.S., Survival capability analysis of four kinds of artificial forests in Loess Plateau (2002) Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, 16 (4), pp. 25-29; Chen, H.S., Wang, K.L., Shao, M.A., A review on the effect of vegetation rehabilation on the desiccation of deep soil layer of Loess Plateau (2005) Scientia of Silvae Sinicae, 41 (4), pp. 155-161; Li, J., Chen, B., Li, X.F., Cheng, J.M., Hao, M.D., Effects of deep soil desiccation on alfalfa grasslands in defferent rainfall areas of the Loess Plateau (2007) Acta Ecologica Sinica, 27 (1), pp. 75-89","Jun, L.; College of Agronomy, Northwest A and F University, Yangling, 712100, China; email: junli@nwsuaf.edu.cn",,,,,,,,18722032,,,,"English","Acta Ecol.
