This study examined the characteristics of greenhouse gas emission from power plants, a major greenhouse gas source in Korea. The power plants examined use bituminous coal, anthracite, and sub-bituminous coal as fuel. The CO2 concentration from power plants was measured using GC-FID with methanizer. The amount of carbon, hydrogen, and calorific values in the input fuel was measured using an elemental analyzer and calorimeter. For fuel analysis, CO2 emission factors for anthracite, bituminous coal, and sub-bituminous coal were 108.9, 88.4, and 97.9 Mg/kJ, respectively. The emission factors developed in this study were compared with those for IPCC. The results showed that CO2 emission was 10.8% higher for anthracite, 5.5% lower for bituminous coal, and 1.9% higher for sub-bituminous coal than the IPCC figures. © 2009.","Climate change; Coal; Emission factor; Greenhouse gas; Power plant","Accurate estimation; Coal-fired power plant; Elemental analyzers; Emission factor; Emission factors; Fuel analysis; Subbituminous coal; Anthracite; Bituminous coal; Coal industry; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Hydrogen; Leakage (fluid); Mining; Fossil fuel power plants; anthracite; bituminous coal; calorimetry; carbon dioxide; coal; coal-fired power plant; emission inventory; environmental policy; global warming; greenhouse gas; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea",,,,,,"Technical guidelines (generator efficiency standards), pp. 14-33. , AGO, version; 2001. p; (1993) Emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States 1985-1990, p. 16. , Energy Information Administration, DOE/EIA-1573;; Garcia, I., Zorraquino, J.V.M., Energy and environmental optimization in thermoelectrical generating processes-application of a carbon dioxide capture system (2002) Energy, 27, pp. 607-623; Hartikainen, T., Lehtonen, J., Mikkonen, R., Reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by utilization of superconductivity in electric-power generation (2004) Appl Energy, 78, pp. 151-158; Hondo, H., Life cycle GHG emission analysis of power generation systems: Japanese case (2005) Energy, 30, pp. 2042-2056; (1996) IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, , IPCC.
