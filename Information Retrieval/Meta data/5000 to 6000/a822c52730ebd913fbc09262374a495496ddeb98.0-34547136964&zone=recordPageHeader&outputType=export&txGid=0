The technologies investigated include reed beds, membrane bioreactors (MBR); membrane chemical reactors (MCR) and an innovative green roof water recycling system (GROW). The materials and energy required for the construction and operation phases of these technologies have been quantified for 20 development scales. All of the information gathered is used to prepare life cycle inventories for each technology. The inventories have been used as an input to Simapro Software for performing LCIA. Two assessment methods (CML-2 and Eco-indc-99) have been employed. For the CML method, the results were processed to express the environmental performance in ten impact categories including climate change/global warming, depletion of abiotic resources, acidification, eutrophication, and human toxicity. For the Eco-indc-99 method, results are shown in three generic environmental indicators: human health, eco system and natural resources. LCIA results obtained for 20 development scales have been used to develop a tool set using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system technique. The study results indicate that the technologies based on natural treatment processes (GROW and reed beds) have low environmental impact. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Green roofs; Greywater recycling; Life cycle impact assessment; Membrane bioreactors; Membrane chemical reactors; Reed beds","Bioreactors; Chemical reactors; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Software packages; Wastewater treatment; Generic environmental indicators; Green roof water recycling system; Greywater; Life cycle impact assessment; Reed beds; Water recycling; bioreactor; fuzzy mathematics; life cycle analysis; membrane; recycling; reedbed; waste technology; wastewater; acidification; article; climate change; computer program; controlled study; ecosystem; energy; environmental impact; eutrophication; fuzzy system; greenhouse effect; health status; household; life cycle assessment; materials; membrane reactor; technology; waste water recycling; Environment; Family Characteristics; Great Britain; Urbanization; Water Purification; Water Supply",,,,,,"Dallas, S., Scheffe, B., Ho, G., Reed beds for greywater treatment - Case study in Santa Elena-Monteverde, Costa Rica, Central America (2004) Ecological Engineering, 23, pp. 55-61; Dixon, A.M., (2000) Simulation of Domestic Water Re-use Systems: Greywater and Rainwater in Combination, , PhD Thesis, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London, London; Friedler, E., Quality of individual domestic greywater streams and its implication for on-site treatment and reuse possibilities (2004) Environmental Technology, 25, pp. 997-1008; Friedler, E., (2005) Performance of Pilot Scale Greywater Reuse RBC/MBR Based Systems, , http://www.watersave.uk.net/Presentations/Friedler_1.pdf, WATERSAVE Network Event.
