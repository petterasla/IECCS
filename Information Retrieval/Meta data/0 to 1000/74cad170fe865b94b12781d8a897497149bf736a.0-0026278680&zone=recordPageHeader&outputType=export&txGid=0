Reasons for their statements range from a simple argument that we do not understand the earth's climate system well enough to predict the future, to more complex arguments involving negative feedbacks and changes of solar activity. They question whether the global temperature increase in this century of up to 0.6 K is primarily a result of worldwide burning of fossil fuels. The purpose of this article is to show that the statements of this skeptical school of thought need to be critically analyzed (and in some cases refuted) in the light of current understanding of the planetary system that determines our climate. -from Author",,"climate system; feedback; fossil fuel; global warming; temperature increase",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026278680
