Owing to this deficiency, life history traits such as geographic range, pollination vector and seed dispersal capability, which significantly affect gene flow and thus the distribution of genetic variability, were used to evaluate the genetic resources in 23 Norwegian native forest tree species. Based on the combination of life history traits the species' genetic resources were classified either as viable, potentially vulnerable or vulnerable, assuming a decrease in within-population variability in this sequence. Twelve widely distributed species with generally effective dispersal of pollen and seeds were considered viable (Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Juniperus communis, Betula pubescens, B. pendula, Alnus incana, A. glutinosa, Salix caprea, Populus tremula, Corylus avellana, Sorbus aucuparia, Prunus padus) and have as such no particular conservation needs. Effective seed dispersal of these species, as inferred from post-glacial migration rates, may be partly responsible for their generally early post-glacial appearance, and may, in combination with the wide ranges and relatively large evolutionary potential, indicate that viable species are best able to cope with climatic change. Among species with restricted ranges and more limited gene flow eight were considered potentially vulnerable (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer platanoides, Taxus baccatu, Ilex aquifolium, Fagus sylvatica, Ulmus glabra) and three were considered vulnerable (Tilia cordata, Malus sylvestris, P. avium). Application of different intensities of a multiple population breeding system (MPBS) is considered the most appropriate mode of conserving genetic resources in these species.","Conservation; Forest trees; Genetic resources; Global warming; Life history traits; Multiple population breeding system","adaptation; environmental change; genetic resource; life history; tree; Norway; Abies; Acer; Acer platanoides; Alnus glutinosa; Alnus incana; Betula; Betula pendula; Betula pubescens; Betulaceae; Corylus; Corylus avellana; Embryophyta; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Fraxinus; Fraxinus excelsior; Ilex; Ilex aquifolium; Juniperus; Juniperus communis; Malus; Malus sylvestris; Malus x domestica; Malvaceae; Picea; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris; Populus; Populus tremula; Prunus; Prunus avium; Prunus padus; Quercus; Quercus petraea; Quercus robur; Salix; Salix caprea; Sorbus; Sorbus aucuparia; Taxus; Tilia cordata; Ulmus; Ulmus glabra",,,,,,"Bacilieri, R., Labbe, T., Kremer, A., Intraspecific genetic structure in mixed populations of Quercus petraea (Matt.)
