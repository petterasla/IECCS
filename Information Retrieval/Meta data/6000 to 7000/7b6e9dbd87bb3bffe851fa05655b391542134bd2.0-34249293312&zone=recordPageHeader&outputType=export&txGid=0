A set of detailed maps were prepared depicting the Physical Vulnerability (PV), specifically storm surge inundation zones are shown for frequent occurrence, 50-year return period, likely scenario for global warming and extreme global warming. Similarly vulnerable areas from strong wind field from tropical cyclones (TCS) are also presented for the same four parameters. Vulnerability zones are presented from a social point of view also based upon certain socio-economic parameters that were included in determining the overall vulnerability of each Mandal in a coastal district (a Mandal represents a group of villages and towns) include: population, senior citizens, women, children under different age groups, type of housing, income level, cyclone shelters, hospitals and medical centres, schools and caste based population. The study is about scenarios that could happen if global warming and the predicted intensification of TCS actually occur as predicted by some numerical models. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Flooding; Inundation Disaster mitigation; Storm surge; Tropical cyclone; Vulnerability","disaster management; global warming; meteorological hazard; storm surge; tropical cyclone; vulnerability; wind field; Andhra Pradesh; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",,,,,,"Vulnerability atlas of India: Earthquakes, windstorms and flood hazards maps and damage risk to housing (1997), Anon Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council, Ministry of Urban Development, Govt. of India, New DelhiChittibabu, P., Dube, S.K., MacNabb, J.B., Murty, T.S., Rao, A.D., Sinha, P.C., Mitigation of flooding and cyclone hazard in Orissa, India (2004) Natural Hazards, 31, pp. 455-485; Chittibabu, P., Dube, S.K., Sinha, P.C., Rao, A.D., Murty, T.S., Numerical simulation of extreme sea levels for the Tamilmadu (India) and Sri Lankan coasts (2004) Marine Geodesy, 25, pp. 706-717; Dube, S.K., Rao, A.D., Sinha, P.C., Chittibabu, P., A real time storm surge prediction system: An application to east coast of India (1994) Proc Indian Natn Sci Acad, 60, pp. 157-170; Dube, S.K., Rao, A.D., Sinha, P.C., Murty, T.S., Bahulayan, N., Storm surge in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea: The problem and its prediction (1997) Mausam, 48, pp. 283-304; Dube, S.K., Chittibabu, P., Rao, A.D., Sinha, P.C., Murty, T.S., Sea levels and coastal inundation due to tropical cyclones in Indian coastal regions of Andhra and Orissa Marine (2000) Geodesy, 23, pp. 65-74; Dube, S.K., Chittibabu, P., Rao, A.D., Sinha, P.C., Murty, T.S., Extreme sea levels associated with severe tropical cyclones hitting Orissa coast of India (2000) Marine Geodesy, 23, pp. 75-90; Dube, S.K., Chittibabu, P., Sinha, P.C., Rao, A.D., Murty, T.S., Numerical modeling of storm surges in the head Bay of Bengal using a location specific model (2004) Natural Hazards, 31, pp. 437-453; Emanuel, K.A., The dependence of cyclone intensity on climate: 1987 (1987) Nature, 326; Emanuel, K.A., Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years (2005) Nature, 436, pp. 686-688; Murty, T.S., (1984) Storm Surges-meteorological Ocean Tides, Canadian Bulletin of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, (212), p. 897. , Ottawa, Canada; Rao, Y.R., Chittibabu, P., Dube, S.K., Rao, A.D., Sinha, P.C., Storm surge prediction and frequency analysis for Andhra coast of India (1997) (1997) Mausam, 48, pp. 555-564; The impact of tropical cyclone on the coastal regions of SAARC countries and their influence in the region, SMRC N (1998), p. 329. , SMRC SAARC Meteorological Research Centre, DHA, Bangladesh, October 1998","Rao, A.D.; Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 110 016, India; email: adrao@cas.iitd.ernet.in",,,,,,,,0921030X,,,,"English","Nat.
