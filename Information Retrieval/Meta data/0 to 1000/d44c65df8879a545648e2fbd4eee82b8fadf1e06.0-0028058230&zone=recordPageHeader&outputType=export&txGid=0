Thus, validation of climate model projections that are driven only by increases in greenhouse gases can be inconsistent when one attempts the validation by looking for a regional or time-evolving 'fingerprint' of such projected changes in real climatic data. Until climate models are driven by time-evolving, combined, multiple, and heterogeneous forcing factors, the best global climatic change 'fingerprint' will probably remain a many-decades average of hemispheric- to global-scale trends in surface air temperatures. Century-long global warming (or cooling) trends of 0.5°C appear to have occurred infrequently over the past several thousand years - perhaps only once or twice a millennium, as proxy records suggest. This implies an 80 to 90 percent heuristic likelihood that the 20th-century 0.5 ± 0.2°C warming trend is not a wholly natural climatic fluctuation.",,,,,,,,,"Schneider, S.H.; Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, United States",,,,,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","SCIENCE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028058230
