The potential negative impacts of transportation on environment can be listed as degradation of air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, increased threat of global climate change, degradation of water resources, noise and habitat loss and fragmentation. Within this interaction, of particular importance is the relationship between urban structure and transport emissions, since it is the urban structure that fundamentally determines transportation demand. Due to the spatial nature of the interaction, Spatial Information Sciences (SIS) has many advantages compared with other systems. The developed model integrates data and methods on spatial bases, detects changes, encompasses monitoring and analyzes the interaction. In order to verify the developed concepts, a pilot project was conducted at the southeast part of Istanbul Metropolitan Area, where the development of motorway and its effects to land use categories between 1987 and 2001 period was analyzed. Within the study area, the road transportation network had been doubled, whereas the construction sites were tripled within the years of 1987-2001. A significant decrease was observed at barren and agricultural land classes. Using the suggested model an integrated framework for exploring the interaction was constituted and the results were discussed. © 2008.","Emission; Environmental impacts; GIS; Land-use; Remote sensing; Transport","Air quality; Climate change; Database systems; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Motor transportation; Remote sensing; Water resources; Spatial information science; Urban structure; Environmental impact assessments; Air quality; Climate change; Database systems; Environmental impact assessments; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Motor transportation; Remote sensing; Water resources; air quality; climate change; emission; environmental degradation; environmental impact; GIS; greenhouse gas; habitat fragmentation; land use; metropolitan area; modeling; nature-society relations; remote sensing; road transport; spatial analysis; Eurasia; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey",,,,,,"Shaw, S., Xin, X., Integrated land use and transportation interaction: a temporal GIS exploratory data analysis approach (2003) J.
