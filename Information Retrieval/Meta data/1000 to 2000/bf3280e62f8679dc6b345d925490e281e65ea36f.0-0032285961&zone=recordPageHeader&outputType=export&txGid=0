Livestock farming systems practised are mainly traditional and guided by socio-economic considerations, available feed resources and market demand. The present status of livestock production and the contribution of livestock to Indian economy through milk, meat, egg, fibre and draught animal power (DAP) have been examined along with future perspectives. The major issues as related to animal production are (i) environmental degradation, (ii) low external input, (iii) impact of technologies on livestock improvement and resource base, and (iv) large number of ruminants and methane emission. Role and impact of technologies as related to animal health, breeding and reproduction, frozen semen, cross-breeding, feeds and feeding and institutional structure in improving livestock productivity and production have been examined. Effects of high livestock density, over grazing and desertification on natural resources and environment and that of large number of ruminants on global warming have been deliberated. Number of livestock specially cattle and buffalo, that can be sustained to meet the higher food needs, DAP, clean environment and maintenance of natural resources have been discussed. A sustainable model for higher productivity of livestock has been proposed.","Animal production; Livestock density; Livestock farming systems",,,,,,,"Chantalakhana, C., Small farm animal production and sustainable agriculture (1990) FFTC Extension Bulletin, 309, p. 17. , FFTC, Taiwan; Devendra, C., Chantalakhana, C., Development of sustainable crop animal systems in Asia (1992) Proceeding of Sixth Asian-Australian Animal Science Congress, 1, pp. 21-40; Edwards, P., Pullin, R.S.V., Gartner, J.A., Research and Education for the development of crop livestock fish farming systems in the tropics (1988) ICLARM Studies and Rev., 1, p. 53; Maji, C.C., Haque, T., Bhattacharya, A., Small farmers and surplus generation - A case of West Bengal (1995) NACP Policy Paper, 5, p. 1995; McDowell, R.E., (1991) A Partnership for Humans and Animals, p. 95. , Kinnic Publishers Raleigh, N.C.
