Much of the greenhouse gas discussion has dealt with carbon dioxide (CO2) and methods to sequester or store atmospheric carbon in soils and forests. The entire carbon cycle needs to be studied to better understand the overall process. The major carbon transformations are loss of CO2 to the atmosphere or the storage of carbon in sinks such as soil. Although it is a minor pathway, carbon leached through the soil and into groundwater needs to be quantified. Numerous carbon studies have been performed, but concentrations and losses of total organic carbon (TOC) moving through a soil profile have received little attention. Therefore, this study was to assess TOC levels in subsurface flow under two management practices. TOC was determined monthly in the percolate from large soil blocks, called lysimeters, (2.4 m [8 ft] deep) with undisturbed soils under row crops. Most of the TOC concentrations in the percolate ranged from 0.5 to 6.0 mg/L with the corn/soybean-rye rotation. Developed springs in two rotational grazing systems were sampled for 10 years. TOC concentrations in the groundwater from the springflow developments had less variability than in the lysimeter percolate. Most TOC values from these pasture systems were in a concentration range of 1 to 3 mg/L. Annual averages of TOC transport were similar for the lysimeter percolate and groundwater springs, ranging from 3.7 to 6.0 kg/ha (3.3 to 5.4 lb/ac).","Carbon concentrations; Carbon transport; Groundwater; Subsurface flow","groundwater; leaching; management practice; organic carbon; Zea mays",,,,,,"Aitkenhead, J.A., Hope, D., Billet, M.F., The relationship between dissolved organic carbon in stream water and soil organic carbon pools at different spatial scales (1999) Hydrological Processes, 13, pp. 1289-1302; Baham, J., Sposito, G., Adsorption of dissolved organic carbon extracted from sewage sludge on montmorillonite and kaolinite in the presence of metal ions (1994) Journal Environment Quality, 23, pp. 147-153; David, M.B., Vance, G.F., Kahl, J.S., Chemistry of dissolved organic carbon and organic acids in two streams draining forested watersheds (1992) Water Resources Research, 28, pp. 389-396; Dunnivant, F.M., Jardine, P.M., Taylor, D.L., McCarthy, J.F., Transport of naturally occurring dissolved organic carbon in laboratory columns containing aquifer material (1992) Soil Science Society America Journal, 56, pp. 437-444; Easthouse, K.B., Mulder, J., Christophersen, N., Seip, H.M., Dissolved organic carbon fractions in soil and stream water during variable hydrological conditions at Birkenes, Southern Norway (1992) Water Resources Research, 28, pp. 1585-1596; Harrold, L.L., Dreibelbis, F.R., Evaluation of agricultural hydrology by monolith lysimeters 1944-55 (1958) U.S. Department of Agriculture Technical Bulletin, 1179. , U.S. Government Printing Office.
