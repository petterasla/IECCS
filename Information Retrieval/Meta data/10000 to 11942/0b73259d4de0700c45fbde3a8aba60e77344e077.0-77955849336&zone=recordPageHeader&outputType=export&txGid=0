The emergence of Echinoparyphium recurvatum (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) cercariae from Lymnaea peregra was studied under natural sunlight conditions, using naturally infected snails of different sizes (10-17mm) within a temperature range of 10-29°C. There was a single photoperiodic circadian cycle of emergence with one peak, which correlated with the maximum diffuse sunlight irradiation. At 21°C the daily number of emerging cercariae increased with increasing host snail size, but variations in cercarial emergence did occur between both individual snails and different days. There was only limited evidence of cyclic emergence patterns over a 3-week period, probably due to extensive snail mortality, particularly those in the larger size classes. Very few cercariae emerged in all snail size classes at the lowest temperature studied (10°C), but at increasingly higher temperatures elevated numbers of cercariae emerged, reaching an optimum between 17 and 25°C. Above this range emergence was reduced. At all temperatures more cercariae emerged from larger snails. Analysis of emergence using the Q10 value, a measure of physiological processes over temperature ranges, showed that between 10 and 21°C (≈15°C) Q10 values exceeded 100 for all snail size classes, indicating a substantially greater emergence than would be expected for normal physiological rates. From 14 to 25°C (≈20°C) cercarial emergence in most snail size classes showed little change in Q10, although in the smallest size class emergence was still substantially greater than the typical Q10 increase expected over this temperature range. At the highest range of 21-29°C (≈25°C), Q10 was much reduced. The importance of these results for cercarial emergence under global climate change is discussed. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.",,"article; cercaria (trematode larva); circadian rhythm; climate change; Echinoparyphium recurvatum; host parasite interaction; Lymnaea peregra; mortality; nonhuman; parasite transmission; photoperiodicity; snail; sunlight; temperature; Animals; Body Size; Body Temperature; Echinostomatidae; Host-Parasite Interactions; Snails; Sunlight; Echinoparyphium recurvatum; Echinostomatidae; Gastropoda; Radix peregra; Trematoda",,,,,,"Adam, M.E., Lewis, J.W., Sites of encystment by the metacercariae of Echinoparyphium recurvatum in Lymnaea peregra (1992) Journal of Helminthology, 66, pp. 96-99; Al-Habbib, W.M.S., Grainger, J.N.R., The effect of constant and changing temperature on the rate of development of the eggs and the larval stages of Fasciola hepatica (1983) Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 83B, pp. 281-290; Anderson, P.A., Nowsielski, J.W., Croll, N.A., The emergence of cercariae of Trichobilharzia ocellata and its relationship to the activity of its snail host Lymnaea stagnalis (1976) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 54, pp. 1481-1487; Asch, H.L., Rhythmic emergence of Schistosoma mansoni cercariae from Biomphalaria glabrata: Control by illumination (1972) Experimental Parasitology, 31, pp. 350-355; Bryant, C., Flockhart, H.A., Biochemical strain variation in parasitic helminths (1986) Advances in Parasitology, 25, pp. 275-319; Chernogorenko, M.I., Periodicity, diurnal rhythm and ecologic factors influencing the rate of issuance of cercariae from mollusc hosts (1982) Hydrobiological Journal, 18 (3), pp. 64-72; Christensen, N.O., Frandsen, F., Roushdy, M.Z., The influence of environmental conditions and parasite-intermediate host-related factors on the transmission of Echinostoma liei (1980) Zeitschrift fur Para-sitenkunde, 63, pp. 47-63; Combes, C., Fournier, A., Mone, H., Theron, A., Behaviours in trematode cercariae that enhance parasite transmission: Patterns and processes (1994) Parasitology, 109, pp. S3-S13; De Souza, C.P., Araujo, N., Jannotti-Passos, L.K., Guimaraes, C.T., Production of Schistosoma mansoni cercariae by Biomphalaria glabrata from a focus in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais (1994) Revista Do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo, 36, pp. 485-489; Dinnik, J.A., Dinnik, N.N., The influence of temperature on the succession of redial and cercarial generations of Fasciola gigantica in a snail host (1964) Parasitology, 54, pp. 59-65; Duerr, F.G., Changes in the size-metabolic rate relationship of Lymnaea stagnalis appressa Say produced by digenetic trematode parasitism (1967) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, 20, pp. 391-398; Evans, N.A., Effect of copper and zinc upon the survival and infectivity of Echinoparyphium recurvatum cercariae (1982) Parasitology, 85, pp. 295-303; Evans, N.A., The influence of environmental temperature upon transmission of the cercariae of Echinostoma liei (Digenea: Echinostomatidae) (1985) Parasitology, 90, pp. 269-275; Evans, N.A., Gordon, D.M., Experimental observations on the specificity of Echinoparyphium recurvatum toward second intermediate hosts (1983) Zeits-chrift fur Parasitenkunde, 69, pp. 217-222; Evans, N.A., Gordon, D.M., Experimental studies on the transmission dynamics of the cercariae of Echinoparyphium recurvatum (Digenea: Echinosto-matidae) (1983) Parasitology, 87, pp. 167-174; Galaktionov, K., Dobrovolskij, A., (2003) The Biology and Evolution of Trematodes: An Essay on the Biology, Morphology, Life Cycles, Transmissions, and Evolution of Digenetic Trematodes, p. 620. , Dordrecht, Kluwer; Getting, P.A., Neural control of behaviour in gastropods (1985) The Mollusca, Vol. 8 Neurobiology and Behaviour, pp. 269-334. , Willow, A.O.D (Ed.)
