Continued growth of greenhouse gas emissions and associated global warming could well promote SLR of 1 m in this century, and unexpectedly rapid breakup of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets might produce a 3-5 m SLR. In this paper, we assess the consequences of continued SLR for 84 coastal developing countries. Geographic Information System (GIS) software has been used to overlay the best available, spatially disaggregated global data on critical impact elements (land, population, agriculture, urban extent, wetlands, and GDP), with the inundation zones projected for 1-5 m SLR. Our results reveal that tens of millions of people in the developing world are likely to be displaced by SLR within this century; and accompanying economic and ecological damage will be severe for many. At the country level results are extremely skewed, with severe impacts limited to a relatively small number of countries. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climatology; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Insulating materials; Leakage (fluid); Sea level; Seawater; Comparative analysis; Developing worlds; Ecological damages; Global datum; Global threats; Green house gas emissions; Greenland; Ice sheets; Scientific evidences; Sea-level rise; Population statistics; climate change; comparative study; developing world; GIS; global warming; greenhouse gas; sea level change; software; Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; West Antarctic Ice Sheet; West Antarctica",,,,,,"Church, J., Gregory, J., Huybrechts, P., Kuhn, M., Lambeck, K., Nhuan, M., Qin, D., Woodworth, P., (2001)Davis, C.H., Li, Y., McConnell, J.R., Frey, M.M., Hannah, E., Snowfall-driven growth in East Antarctica ice sheet mitigates recent sea-level rise (2005) Science, 308 (5730), pp. 1898-1901; Hanna, E., Huybrechts, P., Janssens, I., Cappelen, J., Steffen, K., Stephens, A., Runoff and mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet: 1958-2003 (2005) J Geophys Res, 110, p. 13108; Hansen, J., (2006) Can We Still Avoid Dangerous Human-made Climate Change?, , http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/newschool_text_and_slides.pdf, Presentation on December 6, 2005 to the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California.
