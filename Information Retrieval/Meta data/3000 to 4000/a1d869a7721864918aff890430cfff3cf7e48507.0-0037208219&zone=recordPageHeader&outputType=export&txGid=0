This study explores the possibility of using ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) formation by ammonia carbonation in the gas phase to achieve reduction of CO2 emissions from industrial flue gas. Experimental results obtained in this study demonstrate that removal of flue-gas CO2 can be achieved via formation of solid NH4HCO3 through ammonia carbonation in the gas phase. Removal of CO2 is quantified by monitoring CO2 concentrations at the entrance and exit of the reactor column. The products of ammonia carbonation were identified by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. For the experimental conditions employed in this study, current results show up to 50% removal of CO2 from the flue gas. Higher efficiencies are likely achievable by optimizing the operating conditions and geometry of the reactor.",,"Ammonium bicarbonate; Greenhouse gas emissions; Reactor column; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Flue gases; Optimization; Reduction; Gas emissions",,,,,,"Gessinger, G., (1997) Energy Convers.
