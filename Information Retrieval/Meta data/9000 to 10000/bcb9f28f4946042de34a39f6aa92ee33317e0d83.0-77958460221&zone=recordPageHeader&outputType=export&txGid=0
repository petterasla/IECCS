The simulated evolution of the Chinese climate was consistent with the paleoclimate record during the last deglaciation. For example, the whole Chinese region warmed significantly during the Bølling-Allerød warming event (BA). When the magnitude of the THC was reduced in the sensitivity experiment during BA, warming of the Chinese region was greatly affected. Our work shows that in addition to orbital forcing and greenhouse gases, the THC is an important factor influencing climate change in China at the century scale. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bølling-Allerød warming event; China; climate change; Hulu Cave; model simulation; partial Blocking scheme; thermohaline circulation",,,,,,,"Carissimo, B.C., Oort, A.H., vonder Haar, T.H., Estimating the meridional energy transports in the atmosphere and ocean (1985) J Phys Oceanogr, 15, pp. 82-91; Bryden, H.L., Ocean heat transport across 24°N latitude.
