Results of the analysis indicate that using recycled materials in the base and subbase layers of a pavement can result in reductions in global warming potential (20%), energy consumption (16%), water consumption (11%), and hazardous waste generation (11%) while also extending the service life of the pavement. In addition, using recycled materials in the base and subbase layers can result in a life-cycle cost savings of 21%. The savings are even greater if landfill avoidance costs are considered for the recycled materials incorporated in the pavement. Extrapolation of the benefits to conditions nationwide indicates that modest changes in pavement design to incorporate recycled materials can contribute substantially to the emission reductions required to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at current levels.",,"Avoidance cost; Current levels; Economic benefits; Emission reduction; Energy consumption; Global warming potential; Hazardous waste generation; Highway construction; Highway pavement; Life cycle analysis; Life-cycle cost analysis; Lifecycle costs; Pavement design; Quantitative assessments; Recycled materials; Water consumption; WISCONSIN; Construction industry; Cost accounting; Emission control; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Highway engineering; Industrial wastes; Life cycle; Materials; Ocean structures; Pavements; Recycling; Water supply; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,,"Gambatese, J.A., Rajendran, S., Sustainable roadway construction: Energy consumption and material waste generation of roadways (2005) Proc., Construction Research Congress 2005, , San Diego, Calif; (2008) Primer on Transportation and Climate Change, , AASHTO; Kibert, C.J., Policy instruments for a sustainable built environment (2002) Journal of Land Use and Environmental Law, 17, pp. 379-394; Carpenter, A.C., Gardner, K.H., Fopiano, J., Benson, C.H., Edil, T.B., Life cycle based risk assessment of recycled materials in roadway construction (2007) Waste Management, 27, pp. 1458-1464; (1998) Life-Cycle Cost Analysis in Pavement Design, , Pavement Division Interim Technical Bulletin FHWA-SA-98-079, FHWA, U.S. Department of Transportation; Burlington Bypass Project, , http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/projects/d2/burl/index.htm, Wisconsin Department of Transportation, Accessed April 7, 2009; Bull, J.W., (1993) Life Cycle Costing for Construction, , Taylor & Francis, London; Kirk, S.J., Dell'Isola, A., (1995) Life Cycle Costing for Design Professionals, , McGraw-Hill, New York; (2009) Implementation Recommendations of Equivalency of Alternative Working Platforms and Their Pavement Design Strength Contribution, , Geo Engineering Consulting, Wisconsin Highway Research Program Report 0092-06-08.
