The windrowing method proved to be the most effective with respect to the above parameters. Preliminary investigations of methane from the three systems during processing showed that the minimal intervention method produced high levels of methane (>4 percent) in the waste matrix. The intervention methods , of windrowing or forced aeration, drastically reduced methane output. The importance of animal manures in global agriculture, with reference to methane emissions and global warming, is briefly reviewed. The widespread reliance of manure disposal by the use of simple stacks ,sometimes erroneously elevated to a processing status by use of the term ""passive composting"", is questioned on ecological and environmental grounds. The data from this preliminary study shows the enormous impact that simple windrowing techniques can achieve in terms of organic waste conversion and product quality, concomittant with ecologically acceptable treatment routes.",,"Animal manures; Cattle manure composting systems; Forced aeration; Manure disposal; Methane emissions; Organic waste conversion; Windrowing; Air pollution; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Global warming; Manures; Methane; Moisture; Waste disposal; Composting",,,,,,"Blake, D.R., Rowland, F.S., Continuing worldwide increase in tropospheric methane, 1978 to 1987 (1988) Science, 239, pp. 1129-1131; Chynoweth, D.P., Global significance of biomethanogenesis (1992) ACS Symposium Series, 483, pp. 338-351; Cicerone, R.J., Oremland, R.S., Biogeochemical aspects of atmospheric methane (1988) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 2 (4), pp. 299-327; Duxbury, J.M., The significance of agricultural sources of greenhouse gases (1994) Fertilizer Research, 38, pp. 151-163; (1989) Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate, , Draft report to Congress.
