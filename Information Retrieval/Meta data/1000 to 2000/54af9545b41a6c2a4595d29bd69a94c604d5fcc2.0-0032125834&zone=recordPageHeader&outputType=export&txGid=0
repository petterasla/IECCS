Trout were exposed to slightly elevated water temperatures (+2°C), in the presence and absence of sublethal acidity (pH 5.2) in synthetic softwater for 90 d (8°-12°C). Fish were either fed to satiation (ca. 1%-3% of their wet-body weight daily) or fed 1% of their wet-body weight once every 4 d. Satiation-fed fish exposed to sublethal pH showed no ionoregulatory disturbances but exhibited increased appetites and growth compared to fish in control pH waters. In contrast, fish maintained on a limited ration did not grow and showed typical ionoregulatory responses to acid stress, with lower whole-body Na+ and Cl- concentrations and greater mortality. Detrimental effects were greater in the global warming scenario (+2°C). Overall, a slight temperature increase and sublethal pH increased the cost of living as determined by increased food consumption in satiation-fed fish and greater mortalities in fish maintained on a limited ration. Most important, these findings suggest that fish given sufficient food can compensate for increased energy expenditure or difficulties in maintaining ion balance associated with low pH exposure.",,"acid rain; animal; article; eating; electrolyte balance; energy metabolism; greenhouse effect; physiology; rainbow trout; temperature; Acid Rain; Animals; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Greenhouse Effect; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Temperature; Water-Electrolyte Balance",,"Acid Rain",,,,"Alsop, D.H., Wood, C.M., The interactive effects of feeding and exercise on oxygen consumption, swimming performance, and protein usage in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (1997) J.
