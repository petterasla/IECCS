Increases in annual temperature of 3 to 7°C are projected for Alberta under a 2 × CO2 scenario by 2030-2050 AD. Such an unprecedented rate of change has many short- and long-term implications for forest management and for industries. As the boreal forest is highly sensitive to climatic changes, foresters need to develop a set of safe strategies to minimize the negative impacts and maximize the benefits of these changes. -Authors",,"boreal forest; climatic change; forest management; forest sensitivity; global warming; greenhouse effect; management implication; Canada, Alberta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026295556
