Fires have significantly reduced the density of black spruce Picea mariana populations in forest-tundra uplands, but not in the lowlands. A reduction in tree population density of ≥75% was observed in 22% of upper boreal forest sites, and 45% and 93% of sites located in the forest and shrub subzones, respectively, of the forest-tundra zone. Complete exclusion of tree populations by fire was observed in 43% of upland sites in the N part of the transect; complete removal was a rare event in the S part. Sustained reduction of tree population density after several destructive fires appears as one of the main deforestation processes in the subarctic zone. This leads to the patchy distribution of forest stands and scattered tree populations typical of the forest-tundra biome. The impact of the 1950s fires contributed to the expansion of the forest tundra into the upper boreal forest. -from Authors",,"black spruce; boreal forest; disturbance; fire; forest; spruce; tundra; Canada, Quebec",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00129658,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025954136
