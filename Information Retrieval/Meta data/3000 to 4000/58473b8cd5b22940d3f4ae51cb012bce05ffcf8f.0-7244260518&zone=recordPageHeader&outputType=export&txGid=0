Predicting the risk of species extinctions from this type of habitat degradation is one of the most challenging and urgent tasks facing ecologists. Habitat specialists are thought to be more prone to extinction than generalists; however, specialists may be more susceptible to extinction because (1) they are specialists per se, (2) they are less abundant than generalists, or (3) both. Here, I show that declines in coral abundance lead to corresponding declines in the abundance of coral-dwelling fishes, but with proportionally greater losses to specialists than generalists. In addition, specialists have smaller initial population sizes than generalists. Consequently, specialists face a dual risk of extinction because their already small populations decline more rapidly than those of generalists. Corresponding with this increased extinction risk, I describe the local extinction of one specialist species and the near-global extinction of another species. I conclude that habitat specialists will be the first species lost from coral reefs because their small populations suffer the most from human-induced disturbances. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Acropora; Coral reef fish; Endangered species; Extinction risk; Global warming; Gobiidae; Gobiodon; Habitat specialization; Papua New Guinea; Population decline","Acropora; Anthozoa; Gobiidae; Gobiodon; Pisces",,,,,,"Brown, J.H., On the relationship between abundance and distributions (1984) American Naturalist, 124, pp. 255-279; Ehrlich, P.R., The scale of human enterprise and biodiversity loss (1995) Extinction Rates, pp. 214-226. , (eds Lawton JH, May RM), Oxford University Press, Oxford; Fahrig, L., How much habitat is enough?
