The major gaseous pollutants including CO2, SO2, NOx, CH4, HF and particulates were calculated. The accumulative environmental performances of different energy use strategies and the characterization results, including abiotic depletion potential(ADP), global warming potential(GWP), acidification potential(AP) and human-toxicity potential(HTP) were compared. The results show that the direct emission of fuel combustion in the process is the major contributor to the pollutants emission of magnesium production. Global warming potential and acidification potential make the main contribution to the accumulative environmental impact. The different fuel use strategies in the practice of magnesium production cause much different impacts on the environmental performance. The accumulative environmental impact of coal burned directly is the highest, and that of producer-gas comes to the next, while that of coke-oven gas is the lowest. © 2008 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.","life cycle assessment; magnesium production; Pidgeon process","Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Productivity; Toxicity; Abiotic depletion potential (ADP); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Magnesium production; Pidgeon processes; Magnesium",,,,,,"Editorial Board of the Yearbook of Nonferrous Metals Industry of China, (2005) The yearbook of nonferrous metals industry of China 2005 [M], pp. 503-504. , China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, Beijing (in Chinese); MENG, S.-k., Report for the magnesium industry of China in 2005 [J] (2006) China Metal Bulletin, (21), pp. 3-10. , (in Chinese); CHEN, W.-k., SHI, J.-w., (1995) Development for nonferrous metals (light metals) [M], pp. 165-166. , Central South University of Technology Press, Changsha (in Chinese); MORDIKE, B., EBERT, T., Magnesium properties- application-potential [J] (2001) Mater Sci Eng A, 302, pp. 37-45; LIU, Z., WANG, Z.-g., WANG, Y., LI, F., HAN, X.-l., KLEIN, F., Application and developing tendency of magnesium die casting alloys in automobile industry [J] (1999) Special Casting & Nonferrous Alloys, 19 (5), pp. 55-58. , (in Chinese); LIU, B.-c., Material processing technology in the 21st century [J] (2003) Aeronautical Manufacturing Technology, (6), pp. 17-21. , (in Chinese); RAMAKRISHNAN, S., KOLTUN, P., Global warming impact of the magnesium produced in China using the Pidgeon process [J] (2004) Resources Conservation & Recycling, 24, pp. 49-64; ISO 14040.
