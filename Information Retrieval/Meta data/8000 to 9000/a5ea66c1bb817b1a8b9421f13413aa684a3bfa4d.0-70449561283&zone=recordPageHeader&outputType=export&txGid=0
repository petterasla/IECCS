It simulated a smooth environmental sustainable transition for the next ten years, given the 11 simulated variables. The positive coefficient for GDP growth variable suggests that estimated emissions initially rise with GDP growth, and eventually fall; the impact of population on emissions has been more pronounced in lower rather than in higher income ranges, contradicting Environmental Kuznet Curve. The role of energy efficiency on emissions has been the greatest when CO2 emission is at its peak.","CO2 emission; Emission intensity; Global climate change; Round/year sensitivity model; Sustainability; Variability","CO<sub>2</sub> emission; Emission intensity; Global climate change; Round/year sensitivity model; Sustainability; Variability; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Carbon monoxide",,,,,,"Abramovitz, M., The search for the sources of growth: Areas of ignorance, old and new (1993) J.
