Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO2 rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO2, but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta-analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta-analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO2 on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta-analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta-analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO2 on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta-analysis, suggesting the continued need for long-term experiments. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","C sequestration; Effect size; Elevated CO2; Meta-analysis; Soil C; Statistical power","accumulation rate; assessment method; carbon dioxide enrichment; comparative study; meta-analysis; size effect; soil carbon",,,,,,"Adams, D.C., Gurevitch, J., Rosenberg, M.S., Resampling tests for meta-analysis of ecological data (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1277-1283; Alvarez, R., A review of nitrogen fertilizer and conservation tillage effects on soil organic C storage (2005) Soil Use and Management, 21, pp. 38-52; Bancroft, B.A., Baker, N.J., Blaustein, A.R., Effects of UVB radiation on marine and freshwater organisms: A synthesis through meta-analysis (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 332-345; Billings, S.A., Brewer, C.M., Foster, B.L., Incorporation of plant residues into soil organic matter fractions with grassland management practices in the North American Midwest (2006) Ecosystems, 9, pp. 805-815; Billings, S.A., Schaeffer, S.M., Zitzer, S., Charlet, T., Smith, S.D., Evans, R.D., Alterations of nitrogen dynamics under elevated CO2 in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem: Evidence from δ15N (2002) Oecologia, 131, pp. 462-467; Conen, F., Yakutin, M.V., Sambuu, A.D., Potential for detecting changes in soil organic C concentrations resulting from climate change (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 1515-1520; Cramer, W., Bondeau, A., Woodward, F.I., Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: Results from six dynamic global vegetation models (2001) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 357-373; Curtis, P.S., Wang, X.Z., A meta-analysis of elevated CO2 effects on woody plant mass, form, and physiology (1998) Oecologia, 113, pp. 299-313; De Graaff, M.A., Six, J., Harris, D., Blum, H., van Kessel, C., Decomposition of soil and plant C from pasture systems after 9 years of exposure to elevated CO2: Impact on C cycling and modeling (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 1922-1935; De Graaff, M.A., Van Groenigen, K.J., Six, J., Hungate, B.A., Van Kessel, C., Interactions between plant growth and soil nutrient cycling under elevated CO2: A meta-analysis (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 2077-2091; Dijkstra, F.A., Hobbie, S.E., Reich, P.B., Knops, J.M.H., Divergent effects of elevated CO2, N fertilization, and plant diversity on soil C and N dynamics in a grassland field experiment (2005) Plant and Soil, 272, pp. 41-52; Downing, J., Osenberg, C.W., Sarnelle, O., Meta-analysis of marine nutrient-enrichment experiments: Variation in the magnitude of nutrient limitation (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 1157-1167; Drake, B.G., Jacob, J., Muehe, M., Peresta, G., Gonzalez-Meler, M., Matamala, R., Acclimation of photosynthesis, respiration and ecosystem C flux of a Chesapeake Bay wetland after eight years exposure to elevated CO2 (1997) Plant and Soil, 187, pp. 111-118; Englund, G., Sarnell, O., Cooper, S.D., The importance of data-selection criteria: Meta-analyses of stream predation experiments (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 1132-1141; Fung, I.Y., Doney, S.C., Lindsay, K., John, J., Evolution of C sinks in a changing climate (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102, pp. 11201-11206; Gill, R.A., Polley, H.W., Johnson, H.B., Anderson, L.J., Maherali, H., Jackson, R.B., Nonlinear grassland responses to past and future atmospheric CO2 (2002) Nature, 417, pp. 279-282; Gurevitch, J., Hedges, L.V., Statistical issues in ecological meta-analyses (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 1142-1149; Gurevitch, L., Morrow, L.L., Wallace, A., Walsh, J.S., A meta-analysis of competition in field experiments (1992) American Naturalist, 140, pp. 539-572; Hedges, L.V., Gurevitch, J., Curtis, P.S., The meta-analysis of response ratios in experimental ecology (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 1150-1156; Hedges, L.V., Olkin, I., (1985) Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis, , Academic Press, Orlando, FL; Hoosbeek, M.R., Lukac, M., van Dam, D., More new C in the mineral soil of a poplar plantation under Free Air C Enrichment (POPFACE): Cause of increased priming effect?
