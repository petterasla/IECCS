The performance of each version of the model in terms of cloud and radiation is assessed in relation to satellite data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE). Schemes that include a prognostic cloud water variable show some improvement on those with relative humidity-dependent cloud, but all still show marked differences from the ERBE data. The sensitivity of each of the versions of the model to a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 is investigated. Using an energy balance model, it is estimated that the climate sensitivity using the relative humidity scheme along with the negative feedback from cloud radiative properties would be 2.8°C. Thus, 2.8°-2.1°C appears to be a better estimate of the range of equilibrium response to a doubling of CO 2. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide doubling; climate; cloud parameterisation; general circulation model; impact of cloud parameterization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08948755,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027532797
