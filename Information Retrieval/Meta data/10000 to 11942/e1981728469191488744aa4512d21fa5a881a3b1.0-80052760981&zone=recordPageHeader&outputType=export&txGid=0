No changes were found in photosynthetic rate (Pn) and photosystem II (PS II) performance index on absorption base (PI(abs)) at 40°C for 1h. But transpiration rate was enhanced significantly, which served as a self-protection response for dissipating heat. The Pn decreased significantly at 40°C for 3h, and the decrease became greater at 45°C. Decrease in Pn mainly resulted from stomatal limitation at 40°C for 3h, whereas it was due to non-stomatal limitation at 45°C. Decline in PS II function indicated by the significant decrease in PI(abs), trapped energy flux and electron transport flux were responsible for the decrease in Pn at 45°C. PS II reaction centre and oxygen-evolving complex in the donor side were not affected at high temperatures, but electron transport in the acceptor side was sensitive to high temperature. The PS II function recovered completely 1day after high temperature stress even as high as 45°C, which is favourable for sorghum to meet the challenge of global warming. However, Pn did not completely recover possibly due to heat-induced irreversible damage to CO 2 fixation process. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Climate change; Drought; Gas exchange; JIP test; Photosynthetic recovery; PS II performance","absorption; carbon dioxide; chlorophyll; climate change; drought; electron; energy efficiency; fluorescence; gas exchange; global warming; high temperature; oxygen; photosynthesis; sensitivity analysis; sorghum; stomatal conductance",,,,,,"Anglani, C., Sorghum for human food - a review (1998) Plant Foods Hum.
