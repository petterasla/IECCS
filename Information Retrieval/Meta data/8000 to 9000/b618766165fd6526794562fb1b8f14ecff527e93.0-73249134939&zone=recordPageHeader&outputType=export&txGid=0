Studies comparing road construction byproduct materials with natural aggregates are limited. In the present study, a comparison of these byproducts with natural aggregates was carried out with respect to cost, environmental pollutants generated, and energy consumption. Pollutant emission data were aggregated to express results in terms of global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential and various toxicity potentials. For assessment of toxicity potentials, all the toxicities were represented with respect to 1,4 dichlorobenzene. Mixed results were found from the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and no single material performed superiorly in all categories. Fly ash and bottom ash were found attractive in cost, GWP, and acidification potential categories. RCP had higher GWP and acidification potential compared to natural aggregates. In toxicity categories, in some cases fly ash and bottom ash had higher; and RCP, in all cases, had much lower toxicity compared to natural aggregates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregates; BenReMod; Bottom ash; Fly ash; Life cycle assessment; Model; RCP; Recycled materials; Road construction; Toxicity potentials","BenReMod; Bottom ash; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle assessment model; RCP; Recycled materials; Toxicity potential; Ash handling; Byproducts; Coal ash; Concrete aggregates; Concrete construction; Environmental impact; Fly ash; Global warming; Recycling; Road construction; Roads and streets; Toxicity; Life cycle; 1,4 dichlorobenzene; concrete; acidification; aggregate; bottom ash; construction material; environmental impact assessment; global warming; life cycle; model; recycling; road construction; toxicity; acidification; air pollutant; article; building material; construction work; controlled study; cost; energy consumption; environmental impact assessment; fly ash; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment",,"1,4 dichlorobenzene, 106-46-7",,,,"Ahmed, I., (1993) Use of waste materials in highway construction, , Noyes Data Corporation, Park Ridge, NJ; Apul, D.S., Gardner, K.H., Eighmy, T.T., Modeling hydrology and reactive transport in roads: the effect of cracks, the edge, and contaminant properties (2007) Waste Manage, 27, pp. 1465-1475; Baba, A., Kaya, A., Leaching characteristics of solid wastes from thermal power plants of western Turkey and comparison of toxicity methodologies (2004) J Environ Manage, 73, pp. 199-207; Birgisdottir, H., (2005) Life cycle assessment model for road construction and use of residues from waste incineration, , PhD thesis, Denmark: Institute of Environment and Resources, Technical University of Denmark;; Chowdhury, R., Apul, D.S., A comparative environmental analysis of embankments constructed from conventional materials and industrial byproducts (2007) 2007 TRB annual conference proceedings; Chain Management by Life Cycle Assessment (CMLCA), 2008.
