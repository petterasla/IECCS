In order to accurately evaluate vertical and lateral transport occurring when a turbulent flow impinges on a stratified interface, the turbulent entrainment and vorticity generation mechanisms near the interface must be understood and quantified. Laboratory experiments were performed for three flow configurations: a vertical thermal, a sloping gravity current and a vertical turbulent jet with various tilt angles and precession speeds. All three flows impinged on an interface separating a two-layer stably stratified environment. The entrainment rate is quantified for each flow using laser-induced fluorescence and compared to predictions of Cotel and Breidenthal(1997 Appl. Sci. Res. 57 349-66). The possible applications of transport across stratified interfaces include the contribution of hydrothermal plumes to the global ocean energy budget, turbidity currents on the ocean floor, the design of lake de-stratification systems, modeling gas leaks from storage reservoirs, weather forecasting and global climate change. © 2010 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",,"De-stratification; Entrainment rates; Flow configurations; Gas leaks; Geophysical flows; Global climate changes; Global ocean; Gravity currents; Hydrothermal plume; Laboratory experiments; Laser induced fluorescence; Lateral transport; Ocean floor; Physical process; Storage reservoirs; Stratified environments; Stratified flows; Temporal scale; Tilt angle; Turbidity current; Turbulent entrainment; Turbulent jet; Two layers; Vorticity generation; Climate change; Ocean currents; Sediment transport; Turbidity; Wave power; Weather forecasting; Phase interfaces",,,,,,"Britter, R.E., Linden, P.F., The motion of the front of a gravity current traveling down an incline (1980) J.
