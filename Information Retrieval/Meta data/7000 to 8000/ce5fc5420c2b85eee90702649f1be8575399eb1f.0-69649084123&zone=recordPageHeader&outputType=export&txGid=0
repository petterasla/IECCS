But present progress of fusion energy realization is very much limited in terms of technical gains, which meet the condition for pure fusion power plant, and socio-economic recognition from the public and economic sectors. To boost a rapid progress of fusion energy realization a possible scheme for the quickest 'Utilization ' of fusion fast neutron is proposed by adopting a possible fusion neutron production condition from a presumed further to be developed tokamak, which could be operated by a reliable operation mode. With feasible blanket design along with material development, a possible energy plant, which could be used either for electricity generation or for fissile fuel breeding via hybrid blanket, might be a feasible option as an intermediate step towards fusion era. An initial sketch of system design requirement study and future possible implementation scheme is presented.",,"Blanket designs; Conceptual study; Economic sectors; Electricity generation; Energy plant; Fast neutrons; Fissile fuel breeding; Fusion energy; Fusion neutrons; Fusion power plant; Implementation scheme; Material development; On-Demand; Reliable operation; Socio-economics; System design; Electric generators; Energy utilization; Global warming; Fusion reactors",,,,,,"McNamara, B., ""A briefing on futures with fission & fusion"" (2008) Leabrook Computing, , UK; Maniscalco, J.A., ""Recent progress in fusion-fission hybrid reactor design studies"" (1981) Nuclear Technology/Fusion, 1, pp. 419-478; Bethe, H.A., ""The fusion hybrid reactor"" (1981) Sandia National Laboratories, , SAND81-1265; Bethe, H.A., ""The fusion hybrid"" (1979) Physics Today, 44-51; Jassby, D.L., Fast-Fission Tokamak Breeder Reactors (1986) Journals of Fusion Energy, 5 (3); Staebler, A., ""The improved H-mode at ASDEX Upgrade: A candidate for an ITER hybrid scenario"" (2005) Nucl.
