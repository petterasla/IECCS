Meanwhile, the Southern Hemispheric stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) exhibits a deepening trend. Although previous modeling studies reveal that radiative cooling effect of ozone depletion plays a dominant role in causing the deepening of SPV, the simulated ozone-depletion-induced SPV deepening is stronger than the observed. This suggests that there must be other factors canceling a fraction of the influence of the ozone depletion. Whether the tropical Indian Ocean warming (IOW) is such a factor is unclear. This issue is addressed by conducting ensemble atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments. And one idealized IOW with the amplitude as the observed is prescribed to force four AGCMs. The results show that the IOW tends to warm the southern polar stratosphere, and thus weakens SPV in austral spring to summer. Hence, it offsets a fraction of the effect of the ozone depletion. This implies that global warming will favor ozone recovery, since a warmer southern polar stratosphere is un-beneficial for the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which is a key factor to ozone depletion chemical reactions. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.","Atmospheric general circulation model; Ensemble experiments; Planetary wave; Southern Hemispheric stratospheric polar vortex; Tropical Indian Ocean warming","Atmospheric chemistry; Clouds; Experiments; Flight dynamics; Global warming; Grafting (chemical); Ocean engineering; Ozone; Ozone layer; Sulfur compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Tropics; Vortex flow; Atmospheric general circulation model; Ensemble experiments; Planetary wave; Southern Hemispheric stratospheric polar vortex; Tropical Indian Ocean warming; Oceanography; atmospheric general circulation model; global warming; ozone depletion; planetary wave; polar vortex; Southern Hemisphere; stratosphere; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Swinepox virus (STRAIN KASZA)",,,,,,"Hu, Y., A review on the research progress about the influence of stratospheric polar ozone depletion on tropospheric climate (2006) J Peking Univ (Nat Sci Ser), 45 (5), pp. 562-568. , (in Chinese); Thompson, D.W.J., Solomon, S., Interpretation of recent southern hemisphere climate change (2002) Science, 296, pp. 895-899; Hoerling, M.P., Hurrell, J.W., Xu, T., Twentieth century North Atlantic climate change, Part II: Understanding the effect of Indian Ocean warming (2004) Clim Dyn, 23, pp. 391-405; Li, S., Hoerling, M.P., Peng, S., Coupled ocean-atmosphere response to Indian Ocean warmth (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33 (7), pp. L07713. , 10.1029/2005GL025558; Seager, R., Harnik, N., Kushnir, Y., Mechanism of hemispherically symmetric climate variability (2003) J Clim, 16, pp. 2960-2978; Zhou, T.J., Yu, R., Sea-surface temperature induced variability of the Southern Annular Mode in an atmospheric general circulation model (2004) Geophy Res Lett, 31, pp. L24206. , doi: 10.1029/2004GL021473; Grassi, B., Redaelli, G., Visconti, G., Simulation of polar Antarctic trends: Influence of tropical SST (2005) Geophy Res Lett, 32, pp. L24206. , doi: 10.1029/2005GL023804; L'Heureux, M.L., Thompson, D.J.W., Observed relationships between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the extratropical zonal-mean circulation (2006) J Clim, 19, pp. 276-287; Fan, K., Wang, H.J., Arctarctic Oscillation and the dust weather frequency in North China (2004) Geophy Res Lett, 31, pp. L10201. , doi: 10.1029/2004GL019465; Nan, S., Li, J., The relationship between the summer precipitation in the Yangtze River valley and the boreal spring southern hemisphere annular mode.
