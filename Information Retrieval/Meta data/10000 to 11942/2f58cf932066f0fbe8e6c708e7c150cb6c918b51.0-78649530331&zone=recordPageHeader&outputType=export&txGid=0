Being major energy consumers, air-conditioning (AC) loads are gaining importance. Therefore, the effects of heat insulation methods and AC usage patterns on AC loads should be verified before a building is constructed. This paper examines the AC loads of two typical residential units of steel (S) and reinforced concrete (RC). To compare and analyze these cases, THERB, software for dynamic simulation of the thermal environment of residential buildings, is employed to simulate the loads. Three common patterns based on the lifestyle in Japan are applied in this study to show that different family makeup can lead to varying AC loads. Further, two RC units (exterior wall insulated on the inside/ outside) and one S unit (exterior wall insulated on the inside) are studied. The results reveal that the high heat capacity of concrete influences the living environment and causes differences between the RC and S units. The AC load of an RC unit with an exterior wall that is insulated on the inside is lower than that of a unit with an exterior wall that is insulated on the outside and is almost equal to that of the S unit.","AC load; AC usage patterns; Heat capacity; Temperature","AC load; Compare and analyze; Heat insulation method; High heat capacity; Living environment; Residential building; Thermal environment; Usage patterns; Air conditioning; Computer simulation; Concretes; Global warming; Reinforced concrete; Specific heat; Temperature; Walls (structural partitions)",,,,,,"Heat, Air and Damp Value of Building Material, , J.P.A; Building Material of Daito Steel Plate Company, , Daito Steel Plate Company; Explanation of the energy-saving standards for houses (2002), Institute for Building Environment and Energy ConservationJapanese life style research report (2005), The NHK Broadcasting Culture Research InstituteAkihito, O., Simulation software of the hygrothermal environment of buildings based on detailed thermodynamic models, eSim 2004 (2004) The Canadian Conference on Building Energy Simulation, pp. 45-54; Akihito, O., Tsujimaru, T., Prediction of hygrothermal environment of buildings based upon combined simulation of heat and moisture transfer and airflow (2006) The Journal of the International Building Performance Simulation Association, 16 (2), pp. 30-37; Kuma, Y., Fukuda, H., Ozaki, A., Heat Load Based on Changing the Location, Plan and Specification of Residences (2007) Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering, 6 (1), pp. 183-188; Wang, Y., A study on energy load of a unite of super highrise residences influenced by structural frame IAEE 2007 in NewZealandWang, Y., A Study On AC Load Impact By AC Pattern and Heat Insulation Method of Super High-rise Residences, , IAQVEC 2007 in Sendai of Japan; Wang, Y., Study On Structure Heat Capacity of High-rise Residences, , ASM 2007 in Spain; Yamamori, Y., The heat load influenced by a structural skeleton of super high-rise residences ","Wang, Y.; The University of Kitakyushu, Hibikino 1-1, Wakamatsu-ku, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; email: wangyupeng-sky@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,13467581,,,,"English","J.
