Anthesis is the most sensitive stage in rice and exposure to high temperature during this period may cause reduction in floral reproduction. Increased temperature will have different effects on different rice varieties. In the present study the effect of high temperature on pollen as well as on spikelet sterility in basmati (aromatic) and non-basmati (non-aromatic) rice varieties was quantified. Rice varieties were grown at 11 different sowing dates, to see the effect of varying temperature on pollen and spikelet sterility. Rise in temperature increased pollen sterility and reduced germination of pollen grains on the stigma. Temperature above 33°C during anthesis gradually increased pollen sterility in all rice cultivars. At 35.5°C, variety Pusa Sugandh 2 (basmati) recorded a pollen sterility of 17% and 26% reduction in pollen germination. The principal cause of sterility was reduced anther dehiscence and less pollen deposition on the stigma at higher temperature. Increased temperature during the grain-filling period also increased spikelet sterility in rice and variety Pusa Sugandh 2 was most affected. Non-basmati rice varieties were less affected by increased temperature than basmati types. The study indicated that increasing temperature could limit rice yield by affecting pollen germination and grain formation. It also suggested that sensitivity of pollen grains to temperature damage could be taken as one of the most important parameters for predicting rice yield in warmer climates. © 2010 CSIRO.","Basmati rice; Pollen sterility","comparative study; cultivar; germination; pollen; reproductive potential; rice; sowing date; sterility; temperature effect; yield response; Pusa",,,,,,"Baker, J.T., Allen, L.H., Boote, K.J., Response of rice to carbon dioxide and temperature (1992) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 60 (3-4), pp. 153-166. , doi:10.1016/0168-1923(92)90035-3; Battisti, D.S., Naylor, R.L., Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat (2009) Science, 323, pp. 240-244. , doi:10.1126/ science.1164363; Horie, T., Matsui, T., Nakagawa, H., Omasa, K., Effect of elevated CO2 and global climate change on rice yield in Japan (1996) Climate Change and Plant in East Asia, pp. 39-56. , (Eds K Omasa, K Kai, H Toda, Z Uchijima, M Yoshino) (Springer Verlag: Tokyo); Imaki, T., Tokunaga, S., Obara, S., High temperature induced spikelet sterility of rice in relation to flowering time (1987) Japanese Journal of Crop Science, 56 (EXTRA ISSUE), pp. 209-210. , [In Japanese]; Climate change - impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (2007) Technical Summary of Working Group II to Fourth Assessment Report of Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 23-78. , IPCC (Eds ML Parry, OF Canziani, JP Paultikof, PJ van der Linden, CE Hanon) (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK); Kim, H.Y., Horie, T., Nakagawa, H., Wada, K., Effect of elevated CO2 and high temperature on growth and yield of rice I.
