We investigated the Holocene vegetation history of low arctic continental Nunavut, Canada, from a radiocarbon-dated sediment core from TK-2 Lake, a small-lake ca. 200 km north of the limit of the forest-tundra. The pollen and loss-on-ignition data indicate the presence of dwarf shrub tundra in the region since the beginning of organic sedimentation at ca. 9000 cal. yr BP with dominance of Betula, especially since 8700 cal. yr BP. At 8100-7900 cal. yr BP the dominance of the shrub tundra was punctuated by a transient decline of Betula and coincident increases of Ericaceae undiff., Vaccinium-type, and Gramineae. This suggests an abrupt disturbance of the Betula glandulosa population, approximately simultaneously with the sudden 8200 cal. yr BP event in the North Atlantic. However, in the absence of other sites studied in the area, linkage to the 8200 cal. yr BP event remains tentative. The lack of any evidence of forest-tundra in the region constrains the northern limit of the mid-Holocene advance of the forest-tundra boundary in central northern Canada. Consequently, our results show that the climate models imposing a mid-Holocene advance of the limit of the forest-tundra to the arctic coast of Canada may have overestimated the positive climatic feedback effects that can result from the replacement of tundra by the boreal forest. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","8200 cal. yr BP event; Boreal-arctic boundary; Climate models; Dwarf shrub tundra; Holocene; Pollen","climate modeling; Holocene; paleoclimate; palynology; tundra; vegetation history; Canada; Betula; Betula glandulosa; Ericaceae; Poaceae; Vaccinium",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Mayewski, P.A., Sowers, T., Stuiver, M., Taylor, K.C., Clark, P.U., Holocene climatic instability: A prominent, widespread event 8200 yr ago (1997) Geology, 25, pp. 483-486; Anderson, P.M., Bartlein, P.J., Brubaker, L.B., Gajewski, K., Ritchie, J.C., Vegetation-pollen-climate relationships for the arcto-pollen region of North America and Greenland (1991) Journal of Biogeography, 18, pp. 565-582; Barber, D.C., Dyke, A., Hillaire-Marcel, C., Jennings, A.E., Andrews, J.T., Kerwin, M.W., Bilodeau, G., Gagnon, J.-M., Forcing of the cold event of 8,200 years ago by catastrophic drainage of Laurentide lakes (1999) Nature, 400, pp. 344-348; Bonan, G.B., Pollard, D., Thompson, S.L., Effects of boreal forest vegetation on global climate (1992) Nature, 359, pp. 716-718; Bonsal, B.R., Prowse, T.D., Trends and variability in spring and autumn O°C-isotherm dates over Canada (2003) Climatic Change, 57, pp. 341-358; Chapin F.S., III., Mcguire, A.D., Randerson, J., Pielke R., Sr., Baldocchi, D., Hobbie, S.E., Roulet, N., Running, S.W., Arctic and boreal ecosystems of western North America as components of the climate system (2000) Global Change Biology, 6, pp. 211-223; Chapman, W.L., Walsh, J.E., Recent variations of sea ice and air temperatures in high latitudes (1995) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 74, pp. 33-47; Clark, P.U., Marshall, S.J., Clarke, G.K.C., Hostetler, S.W., Licciardi, J.M., Teller, J.T., Freshwater forcing of abrupt climate change during the last glaciation (2001) Science, 293, pp. 283-287; Crucifix, M., Loutre, M.-F., Tulkens, Fichefet, T., Berger, A., Climate evolution during the Holocene: A study with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (2002) Climate Dynamics, 19, pp. 43-60; Cwynar, L.C., A Late-Quaternary vegetation history from Hanging Lake, northern Yukon (1982) Ecological Monographs, 52, pp. 1-14; Cwynar, L.C., Spear, R.W., Reversion of forest to tundra in the central Yukon (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 202-212; Cwynar, L.C., Spear, R.W., Paleovegetation and paleoclimatic change in the Yukon at 6 ka BP (1995) Geographic Physique et Quaternaire, 49, pp. 29-35; Cwynar, L.C., Burden, E., McAndrews, J.H., An inexpensive sieving method for concentrating pollen and spores from fine-grained sediments (1979) Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 16, pp. 1115-1120; Dean, W., Determination of carbonate and organic matter in calcareous sediments and sedimentary rocks by loss on ignition: Comparison with other methods (1974) Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, 44, pp. 242-248; Dyke, A.S., Prest, V.K., The late Wisconsinan history of the Laurentide ice-sheet (1987) Geographie Physique et Quaternaire, 41, pp. 237-263; (1989) Ecological Land Classification Series, No. 23, , Ecoregions Working Group (of the Canada Committee on Ecological Land Classification).
