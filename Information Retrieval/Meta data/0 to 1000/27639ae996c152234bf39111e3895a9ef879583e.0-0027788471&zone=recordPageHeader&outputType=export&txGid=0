To validate this hypothesis, the authors explored the use of data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to discriminate the presence and extent of lake ice during the winter of 1990-1991 on the 45 lakes and reservoirs in Wisconsin with a surface area greater than 1000 hectares. Results suggest both the feasibility of using the AVHRR to determine the date of lake ice breakup as well as the strong correlation (R = 0.87) of the date so derived with local surface-based temperature measurements. These results suggest the potential of using current and archival satellite data to monitor changes in the date of lake ice breakup as a means of detecting regional ""signals' of greenhouse warming. -Authors",,"AVHRR; greenhouse warming; lake ice; USA, Wisconsin; Climatology; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Surveys; Global changes; Global warming; Ice breakup; Lake ice phenology; Satellite observatories",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027788471
