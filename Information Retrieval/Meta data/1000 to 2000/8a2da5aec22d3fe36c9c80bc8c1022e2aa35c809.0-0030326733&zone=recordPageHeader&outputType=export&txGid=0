The high artcic ice caps have received the most consistent monitoring, whereas glaciers on Baffin Island have been monitored for shorter intervals since the 1960s. Although mass balance data for selected Baffin glaciers show no clear trend over the monitoring peirod, there appears to be reasonable agreement between summer temperature and annual mass balance. In contrast to global warming trends, the Baffin region has experienced a general cooling over the last 30 yr, particularly in winter. The cause of this cooling is not fully understood and its impact on the local ice cover is uncertain. In order to address these issues, mass balance observations should be resumed on a su itable glacier as part of an integrated environmental monitoring program in the region.",,"climate change; glacier; global warming; monitoring; Canada, Nunavut",,,,,,,"Bell, T.; Dept Geog, Memorial Univ of Newfoundland, St Johns Nfld A1B 3X9, Canada",,,,,,,,03150941,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030326733
