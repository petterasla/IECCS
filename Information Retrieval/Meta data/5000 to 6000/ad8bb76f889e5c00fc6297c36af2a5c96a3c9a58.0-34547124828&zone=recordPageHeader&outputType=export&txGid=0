Although climate models consistently predict increases in global temperatures due to increasing greenhouse gases and the accompanying global warming, observations at the climatic timescales necessary to confirm the models are rare. Multidecadal studies at global and regional scales are necessary to determine whether the presently observed changes in temperature and precipitation are due to short-term fluctuations or long-term trends. In this study, we address this issue by examining changes in temperature and precipitation on Long Island, New York over a 74-year time period (1931 to 2004) using a network of rain gauges and temperature measurements. The mean annual temperature on Long Island has increased at a rate of 0.05°C per decade, which is less than that of observed global values and is most likely due to the urban warming effects of New York City, not large-scale climate change. The mean total annual precipitation has increased at a rate of 0.71 cm per decade during the study period, which is consistent with global observations. Intra-annual temperature fluctuations are decreasing at a rate of 0.36% per decade, while precipitation variations are increasing at a rate of 0.91% per decade. Empirical orthogonal function analysis indicates that variations in temperature and precipitation on Long Island are dominated by island-wide fluctuations that are directly related to the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation.",,"air temperature; climate change; global warming; precipitation (climatology); raingauge; Long Island [New York]; New York [United States]; North America; United States",,,,,,"BOSILOVICH, M.G., SCHUBERT, S.D., WALKER, G.K., Global changes of the water cycle intensity (2005) J.
