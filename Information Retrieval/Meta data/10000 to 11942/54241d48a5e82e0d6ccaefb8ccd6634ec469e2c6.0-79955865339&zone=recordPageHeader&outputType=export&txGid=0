It is found that the Brahmaputra Valley climate became warmer and wetter from 1980 to 2005, and the change magnitude is higher than that over the whole Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, the respondence of the Brahmaputra valley to the global warming is more evident than that of the whole plateau during the period. The relationship between atmospheric circulation indices and the regional climate change is significant. When North Atlantic Oscillation index is higher in summer, the climate of the Brahmaputra Valley becomes warmer and dryer; vice versa. When South Oscillation index is higher, it becomes warmer and wetter; vice versa. Worthy of note, the results in this study only emphasize some evidence of change in temperature and precipitation over the Brahmaputra Valley during 1980-2005. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Atmospheric circulation; Brahmaputra; North atlantic oscillation indices; Oscillation index; Regional climate changes; Tibetan Plateau; Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Global warming; Landforms; atmospheric circulation; correlation; global warming; precipitation intensity; regional climate; temperature profile; valley; Asia; Brahmaputra Valley; India",,,,,,"Cai, Y., Li, D., Tang, M., Decadal temperature changes over Qinghai-Xizang Plateau in recent 50 years (2003) Plateau Meteorology, 22 (5), pp. 464-470. , [in Chinese]; Ding, Y., Ye, B., Han, T., Regional difference of annual discharge variation over the West China during last 50 Years (2007) Sciences in China (Series D), 37 (2), pp. 206-214. , [in Chinese]; Feng, S., Tang, M., Wang, D., New evidence for the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) plateau as a pilot region of climatic fluctuation in China (1998) Chin Sci Bull, 43 (6), pp. 633-636. , [in Chinese]; Folland, C.K., Observed climate variability and change (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, pp. 99-181. , J.
