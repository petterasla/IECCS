However, its use has a major impact on the environment, especially by discharging air pollutants into the atmosphere. In addition, energy production from fossil fuel, the world's most important fuel, is recently known to be the key contributor of CO2 (a major greenhouse gas) resulting in global warming problems. This article is an extension of our earlier research work to demonstrate how cogeneration concepts can be used to reduce production costs and simultaneously produce electricity, steam, as well as industrial gases such as CO2. With cogeneration, there is very little air pollution discharged into the atmosphere. We discuss a case study of an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) application.
