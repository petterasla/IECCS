Most of the CH 4 is emitted via transport through the plant gas vascular system. We used this transport for stable isotope probing (SIP) of the methanotrophs in the rhizosphere under field conditions and pulse-labelled rice plants in a Chinese rice field with CH 4 (99% 13 C) for 7 days. The rate of 13 CH 4 loss rate during 13 C application was comparable to the CH 4 oxidation rate measured by the difluoromethane inhibition technique. The methanotrophic communities on the roots and in the rhizospheric soil were analyzed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), cloning and sequencing of the particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) gene. Populations of type I methanotrophs were larger than those of type II. Both methane oxidation rates and composition of methanotrophic communities suggested that there was little difference between urea-fertilized and unfertilized fields. SIP of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA-SIP) and rRNA (RNA-SIP) were used to analyze the metabolically active methanotrophic community in rhizospheric soil. PLFA of type I compared with type II methanotrophs was labelled more strongly with 13 C, reaching a maximum of 6.8 atom-%. T-RFLP analysis and cloning/sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that methanotrophs, especially of type I, were slightly enriched in the heavy fractions. Our results indicate that CH 4 oxidation in the rice rhizosphere under in situ conditions is mainly due to type I methanotrophs. © 2008 International Society for Microbial Ecology.","Methane-oxidizing bacteria;
