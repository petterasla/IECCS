It arose via superimposed life-cycle pathways and adaptive responses between grasshopper phenologies and their environmental constraints. The observed retention of population stability despite shifts in the patterns of abundance implies some predictability, and potential effects of climate change (increased temperature, rainfall and raindays) are examined in a context of global warming. Flora and fauna could eventually become depleted in alpine regions due to the displacement of grasshopper populations to vegetation-scree margins where physical weathering and vegetation instability are often pronounced. The highly flexible P. nitidus life cycle emphasises a high level of variation in egg phenology, whereby alternative overwintering pathways (quiescence, diapause, extended diapause) lead to variable life-cycle durations. The schematic cycle accommodates Sigaus australis and Brachaspis nivalis, and is probably applicable to New Zealand's alpine Orthoptera in general. Population mortality sequences are identified throughout the cycle. A classic predator-prey resonse may arise between a native skink species and grasshoppers. -from Authors",,"alpine; climatic change; grasshopper; Orthoptera; New Zealand; Brachaspis nivalis; Paprides nitidus; Sigaus australis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01106465,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026302819
