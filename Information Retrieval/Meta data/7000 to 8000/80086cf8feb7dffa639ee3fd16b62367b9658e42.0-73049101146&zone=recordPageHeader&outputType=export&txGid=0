Pollutants formed after industrial activities. Industry burning fossil fuels releasing into the atmosphere the greenhouse gases that warm the Earth, carbon dioxide in excess favors retaining heat from the earth surface, thereby preventing its reflection in the atmospheric layers. Is thus the greenhouse effect which leads to raising the average temperature of earth atmosphere, melting polar glaciers, floods, etc. Because the chemicals disposed in the atmosphere, especially Freon in certain places on earth, the ozone layer decreased or even disappeared. This in turn leads to climate change, the increase the weather extremes, more droughts, heat, catastrophic fires and floods. Another serious consequence of pollution is acid rain generated by the transformation of sulfur oxides and nitrogen in the atmosphere, in sulfuric acid and nitric respectively. Acid rain burns the plants tissues which become yellow and die. Whole forests have disappeared in this case. If the air pollution-symbol image is provided by trees ""perforated"" by acid rain, water pollution expression feature could be considered ""black tide"" that is virtually pollution continue, the big oil and the world oceans, with disastrous effects on flora and marine fauna. Lack of strong and urgent measures to reduce and even eliminate pollution can result in a time not too remote, the catastrophic and irreparable mutations on the ecosystem. Environmental protection is not just an individual problem, but requires a collective and mutual help.","Environment; Morbidity by professional diseases; Pollution; Quality of life; Toxic waste",,,,,,,"Botnariuc, N., Vadineanu, A., (1982) Ecology, , EDP, Bucharest; Lupei, N., (1977) Biosphere, , Edit.
