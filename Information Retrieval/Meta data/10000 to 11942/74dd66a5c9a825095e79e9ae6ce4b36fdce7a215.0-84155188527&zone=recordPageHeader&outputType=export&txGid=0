The potential role that the current global warming plays in the formation of abnormally hot summers in the European part of Russia is discussed. Although the main reason for the extreme heat wave in 2010 was a quasi-stationary anticyclone blocking westerlies, global warming could also contribute to the observed temperature extremums adversely affecting the biota. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","abnormal heat; blocking anticyclone; climate; climate anomaly; climate change; global warming; surface; temperature","anticyclone; climate change; estimation method; global warming; heat flux; observational method; probability; summer; temperature anomaly; Russian Federation",,,,,,"Khromov, S.P., Mamontova, L.I., (1974) Meteorological Dictionary, , Leningrad: Gidrometeoizdat; Shakina, N.P., Ivanova, A.R., Blocking Anticyclones: the Current State of Research and Forecasting (2010) Meteorol.
