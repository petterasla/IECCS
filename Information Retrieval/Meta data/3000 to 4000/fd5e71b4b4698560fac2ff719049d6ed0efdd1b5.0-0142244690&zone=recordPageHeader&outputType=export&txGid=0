Scenarios considered in the study include historical, present and future conditions of cropland and climate. This research gives the first overview of the global situation of soil erosion potential considering the previous century as well as the present and future. Present soil erosion potential is estimated to be about 0·38 mm year-1 for the globe, with Southeast Asia found to be the most seriously affected region in the world. It is estimated that nearly 60% of present soil erosions are induced by human activity. With development of cropland in the last century, soil erosion potential is estimated to have increased by about 17%. Global warming might significantly increase the potential for soil erosion, and the regions with the same increasing trend of precipitation and population might face much more serious problems related to soil erosion in the future. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Global change; Global warming; Land use change; RUSLE; Soil erosion","Climatology; Geographic information systems; Hydrology; Land use; Mathematical models; Soils; Soil erosion; Erosion; climate change; GIS; global perspective; land use change; soil erosion; Asia",,,,,,"Arnoldus, H.M.J., An approximation of the rainfall factor in the USLE (1980) Assessment of Erosion, pp. 127-132. , DeBoodt M, Gabriels D (eds).
