This leads us to review the latest research into proposed mechanisms that govern the synchronous production of seed across wide geographic areas. Finally, we speculate on the admittedly uncertain effects of global climate change on ecosystems in which masting plays a crucial role.",,"Mastication; Masting; Mystery; Forestry; climate change; global change; masting; Forestry; Mastic",,,,,,"Curran, L.M., Caniago, I., Paoli, G.D., Astianti, D., Kusneti, M., Leighton, M., Nirarita, C.E., Haeruman, H., Impact of El Niño and logging on canopy tree recruitment in Borneo (1999) Science, 286, pp. 2184-2188; Elkinton, J.S., Healy, W.M., Buonaccorsi, J.P., Boettner, G.H., Hazzard, A.M., Smith, H.R., Liebhold, A.M., Interactions among gypsy moths, white-footed mice, and acorns (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 2332-2342; Jones, C.G., Ostfeld, R.S., Richard, M.P., Schauber, E.M., Wolff, J.O., Chain reactions linking acorns to gypsy moth outbreaks and Lyme disease risk (1998) Science, 279, pp. 1023-1026; Kelly, D., Sork, V.L., Mast seeding in perennial plants: Why, how, where?
