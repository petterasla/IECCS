This particular set of weights, or metric, has a limited capacity to handle the large variations in atmospheric adjustment times, and emissions of various gases that are equal in terms of 'CO2 equivalents' will not result in equal climatic effects. In this study, the 100-year GWP metric is assessed in the context of implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Using data from Norway, we explore how abatement policy formulated on the basis of 100-year GWPs compares to policies based on other metrics in terms of compliance costs and abatement profile, that is, the composition of the basket of gases reduced. We found that the costs for Norway change significantly when other metrics are used, but changes in the composition of the basket of gases are moderate. However, since compliance costs can be controlled through other mechanisms for post-Kyoto Protocols, the use of 100-year GWPs versus other metrics has little impact on the general formulation of Norwegian climate policy.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost accounting; Dust abatement; Gas emissions; Public policy; Kyoto protocols; Global warming; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; global warming; Kyoto Protocol",,,,,,"albritton, D.L., Derwent, R.G., Isaksen, I.S.A., Lal, M., Wuebbles, D.J., Radiative forcing of climate change and an evaluation of the IPCC IS92 emission scenarios (1995) Climate Change 1994, pp. 211-231. , Houghton, J.
