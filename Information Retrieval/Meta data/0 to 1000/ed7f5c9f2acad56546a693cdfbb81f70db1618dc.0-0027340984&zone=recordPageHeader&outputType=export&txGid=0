This requires considerable structural changes in energy production. There is clear evidence that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide causes the 'greenhouse effect', while opinions differ about its seriousness. However, it is the first real threat caused by mankind to his own life expectancy. Finland - as other European countries - has engaged to freeze and later also to reduce its CO2 emissions. Can energy production be based essentially on fossil fuels or are nuclear power and renewable energy sources the only energy alternatives in the future? © 1992.","bioenergy; cogeneration; combined-cycle processes; gasification; Global warming; IGCC; power production","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Nuclear energy; Renewable energy resources; Bioenergy; Global warming; IGCC; Greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; fuel; air pollution; article; bioenergy; biomass; energy resource; europe; finland; greenhouse effect; life expectancy; nuclear energy; pollution control; power supply; alternative energy; emission control; energy production; global warming; production alternative; structural change; Finland",,,,,,"Ahlholm, Silvoja, (1990) The proportion of peat production and use in the carbon balance of the world and of Finland, p. 183. , Ministry of Trade and Industry, Helsinki, In Finnish; Hepola, Solantausta, Johansson, Recovery of carbon dioxide from the flue and product gases of energy production processes (1990) Research Notes 1190, p. 61. , Technical Research Centre of Finland, Espoo, In Finnish; English abstract; Jantunen, Nevanlinna, (1990) The greenhouse effect, climatic changes and Finland, , The Finnish Academies of Technical Sciences, Helsinki; Lepistö, (1991) Energy saving project, p. 100. , Ministry of Trade and Industry, Helsinki, In Finnish; Ministry of the Environment, (1991) Report of the Carbon Dioxide Commission, , Helsinki; Ministry of Trade and Industry, (1990) Development trends in energy economy by the year 2025, p. 70. , Helsinki, Series B; Sipilä, JALO Fuel conversion (1991) Interim report 1988–1990, 85, p. 46. , Energy Department, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Helsinki, Reviews B","Sipilä, K.; Technical Research Centre of Finland, Laboratory of Fuel and Process Technology, Espoo, Finland",,,,,,,,09608524,,BIRTE,,"English","Bioresour.
