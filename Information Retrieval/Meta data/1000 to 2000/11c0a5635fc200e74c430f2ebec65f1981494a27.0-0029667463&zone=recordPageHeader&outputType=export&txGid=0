By examining surface conditions reconstructed from geologic data for the Last Glacial Maximum, the middle Cretaceous and the early Eocene, the equilibrium climate sensitivity to radiative forcing changes for different extreme climates is estimated. Finds that the ratios for these three periods, within error bounds, all lie in the range obtained from general circulation models: 2-5 K global warming for doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide. Paleocalibration thus provides a data-based confirmation of theoretically calculated climate sensitivity. -from Authors",,"climate sensitivity; Cretaceous; Eocene; Last Glacial Maximum; palaeocalibration method; palaeoclimate; palaeoclimate data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667463
