A win-win garbage collection and kerbside recycling program established more than eight years ago in a small rural community in Ohio, US is still going strong. It is offering a relatively inexpensive way for waste disposal by providing an incentive-based and highly participatory kerbside recycling and at the same time bringing in substantial franchise fees for the municipal coffers. Unlike garbage contracts in most communities that are designed for only residential waste collection, this program extends disposal and recycling services to non-residential establishments. It picks up hard-to-dispose household furniture, appliances and other bulky items without additional costs to the residents. By being creative and assessing local political and socio-economic milieu, public officials can implement a comprehensive service package for taking care of their community throwaways. However, before establishing such programs in partnership with a private firm, city administrators must understand the intricacies of bid specifications customized for municipal wastes and recyclable materials.","Municipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling contract; Pay-as-you-throw; Waste reduction","Additional costs; Energy cost; Garbage collection; Municipal solid waste; Municipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling contract; Municipal waste; Pay-as-you-throw; Public officials; Recyclable material; Recycling programs; Residential wastes; Rural community; Service package; Socio-economics; Sustainable services; Waste reduction; Win-win; Economics; Energy conversion; Global warming; Recycling; Refuse collection; Sailing vessels; Solid wastes; Waste disposal; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste disposal; controlled study; domestic waste; environmental sustainability; financial management; government; greenhouse effect; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; political system; priority journal; recycling; review; rural area; socioeconomics; United States; waste disposal; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Garbage; Household Articles; Ohio; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Ohio; United States",,,,,,"Arsova, L., Van Haaren, R., Goldstein, N., Kaufman, S.M., The state of garbage in America (2008) BioCycle, 49 (2), pp. 22-29; Alter, H., The future course of solid waste management in the U.S. (1991) Waste Management and Research, 9 (1), pp. 3-20; (2004) District Solid Waste Plan, 2002-2020, , Carroll-Columbiana-Harrison Joint Solid Waste Management District Carrollton, Ohio, USA; (2008) Carroll-Columbiana-Harrison Joint Solid Waste Management District., , www.Recyclingmakessense.org, September 21, 2008; http://www.celdf.org/HomeRule/WhatisHomeRule/tabid/114/Default.aspx, Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF).
