Historical data of global CO2 emission and global surface temperature anomalies over 129 years from 1860-1988 are used in this study. The causal relationship between the two phenomena is first examined using the Sim and Granger causality test in the time domain after the data series are filtered by ARIMA models. The Granger causal relationship is further scrutinized and confirmed by cross-spectral and multichannel spectral analysis in the frequency domain. The evidence found from both analyses proves that there is a positive causal relationship between the two variables. The time domain analysis suggests that Granger causality exists between global surface temperature and global CO2 emission. Further, CO2 emission causes the change in temperature. The conclusions are further confirmed by the frequency domain analysis, which indicates that the increase in CO2 emission causes climate warming because a high coherence exists between the two variables. Furthermore, it is proved that climate changes happen after an increase in CO2 emission, which confirms that the increase in CO2 emission does cause global warming.","Causality test; CO2 emission; Coherence; Empirical study; Global warming; Multichannel spectral estimation; Systems analysis","carbon dioxide; article; atmosphere; environmental temperature; global climate; greenhouse effect; spectroscopy; system analysis; carbon dioxide emission; frequency domain analysis; global surface temperature; global warming; time domain analysis",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Benarde, M.A., (1992) Global Warming . . .
