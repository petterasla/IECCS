The crops produced in a cold area may be greatly influenced by warming. This study is undertaken to assess the impact of global warming on the production of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) in Japan. The temperature ranges assumed to be appropriate for the cultivation of apple are 6-14°C on annual mean temperature and 13-21°C on mean temperature from April to October, respectively. The database of ""Climate Change Mesh Data (Japan)"" was used to simulate possible changes in favorable regions for the cultivation of apple with approximately 10 by 10 km resolution. The mesh data derived from IPCC IS92a-type emission scenario and four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (A-O GCMs). It was predicted that the favorable regions to cultivate apples will gradually move northward. All the plains of southern Tohoku in 2040's and central Tohoku in 2060's will be unfavorable for apple cultivation, while most of regions in Hokkaido will be suitable by 2060's. Many parts of the current apple producing districts in Japan will be possibly unfavorable by 2060's. Therefore, global warming will greatly affect the cultivation environment of apples in Japan by the middle of the 21st century.","Climate change; Mesh climate data; Producing district; Suitable regions","Malus x domestica",,,,,,"Albrigo, L.G., Childers, N.F., Effect of succinamic acid, 2-2-dimethyl hydrazide and late-season night temperature on the maturity indices of 'Stayman' apples (1970) J.
