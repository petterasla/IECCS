It occupied one-sixth of the land surface of the Earth. An understanding of the pools and fluxes of biogenic C in the FSU is essential to the development of international strategies aimed at mitigation of the negative impacts of global climate change. The territory of the FSU is represented by a variety of climate conditions. The major part of the FSU territory is in the boreal and temperate climatic zones. The climate in the FSU changes from arctic and subarctic in the North to subtropical and desert in the South. From west to east, the climate makes a transition from maritime to continental to monsoon. The vegetation of the FSU includes the following principal types: forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland, tundra, desert, peatlands and cultivated land. Arctic deserts and tundra formations are found in the northern part of the FSU; deserts and semi-deserts are found in the southern part. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"carbon flux; primary productivity; terrestrial ecosystem; Russian Federation; Carbon; Ecosystems; Environmental engineering; Biogenic carbon; Carbon flux; Carbon pools; Former Soviet Union; Geographic information system; Biomass; carbon; air pollution; atmosphere; biomass; climate; conference paper; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; measurement; ussr",,,,,,"Aleksandrova, V.D., (1977) Geobotanical Regionalization of Arctic and Antarctic, , Nauka Press, Leningrad; Apps, M.J., A.W.
