Observations of recent climate history indicate that the frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall events is increasing. This increasing trend will likely continue in the future due to global warming. In this study, extending from previous analysis results for Chicago, the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships were determined to represent the climate conditions of the first and second halves of the last century. Using these IDF relationships, the impact of the observed increase in heavy rainfall events on the design and performance of urban drainage systems were quantified. This quantification demonstrated the need for updating rainfall IDF relationships to reflect changing climate conditions. In the design of new and retrofitting or replacement of old urban drainage systems, up to date IDF relationships need to be used to maintain design standards. © 2006 ASCE.","Climatic changes; Drainage; Floods; Rainfall; Stormwater management; Urban areas","Climate change; Design; Floods; Rain; Standards; Drainage systems; Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships; Stormwater management; Drainage; Climate change; Design; Drainage; Floods; Rain; Standards; climate effect; design flood; drainage; environmental impact; flood control; rainfall; stormwater; urban area; water management; Chicago; Illinois; North America; United States",,,,,,"Angel, J.R., Huff, F.A., ""Changes in heavy rainfall in midwestern United States"" (1997) J.
