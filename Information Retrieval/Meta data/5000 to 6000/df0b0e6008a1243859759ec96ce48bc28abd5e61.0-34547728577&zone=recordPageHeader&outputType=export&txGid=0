One of the solutions is the conversion of fossil fuel into carbon-free energy carriers, hydrogen, and electricity with CO2 capture and storage. In this paper, the main purpose is to investigate the thermodynamics performance of converting coal to a hydrogen and electricity system with chemical-looping reactors and to explore the influences of operating parameters on the system performance. Using FeO/Fe3O4 as an oxygen carrier, we propose a carbon-free coproduction system of hydrogen and electricity with chemical-looping reactors. The performance of the new system is simulated using ASPEN PLUS software tool. The influences of the chemical-looping reactor's temperature, steam conversion rate, and O2/coal quality ratio on the system performance, and the exergy performance are discussed. The results show that a high-purity of H2 (99.9%) is reached and that CO2 can be separated. The system efficiency is 57.85% assuming steam reactor at 815 °C and the steam conversion rate 37%. The system efficiency is affected by the steam conversion rate, rising form 53.17 to 58.33% with the increase of the steam conversion rate from 28 to 41%. The exergy efficiency is 54.25% and the losses are mainly in the process of gasification and HRSG. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactors; Computer simulation; Electricity; Hydrogen; Separation; Software packages; Thermodynamic properties; Chemical looping reactors; Exergy efficiency; Software package ASPEN PLUS; Steam conversion; Coal gasification",,,,,,"De Lorenzo, L.; Kreutz, T.
