Drylands support the full spectrum of production systems from commercial ranching in Australia, western USA, Mexico, Argentina and southern Africa through various gradations of crop-livestock systems in Africa and Asia to traditional nomadic and semi-nomadic subsistence systems. Almost everywhere, livestock production is undergoing rapid change in response to political, social, economic, environmental and demographic pressures. In this paper, we will outline the characteristics of various production systems, review their prospects and identify the problems and challenges facing them. We will assess the likely impact of global climate change and of the new technologies and the new economic world order. Finally, we will try to predict what the 21st century will be like for the millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the grazing by domesticated livestock.","Dryland; Feed; Livestock management; Rangeland; Sustainability",,,,,,,"Agricultural Systems Research for Developing Countries (1987) ACIAR Proceedings No.11: Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, 189p. , Ed.
