Global gridded time series data sets of monthly mean temperatures for the period 1880-2007/2008 are analysed to show that data sets and corresponding power spectra exhibit distributions close to the model predicted inverse power law distribution. The model predicted and observed universal spectrum for interannual variability rules out linear secular trends in global monthly mean temperatures. Global warming results in intensification of fluctuations of all scales and manifested immediately in high frequency fluctuations. © 2011 Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fractals and statistical normal distribution; golden mean and fractal fluctuations; long-range correlations and fat tail distributions; power law distributions","Data sets; Fractal fluctuations; General systems theory; Golden mean; High frequency fluctuations; Interannual variability; Inverse power law; long-range correlations and fat tail distributions; Mean temperature; Power law distribution; Power-spectra; Secular trend; Temperature anomaly; Time integration; Time-series data; Fractals; Global warming; Time series; Normal distribution",,,,,,"Mandelbrot, B.B., (1975) Les Objets Fractals: Forme, Hasard Et Dimension, , Paris: Flammarion; Bak, P.C., Tang, C., Wiesenfeld, K., Self-organized criticality (1988) Phys.
