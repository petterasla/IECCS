This alpine meadow was a weak sink for atmospheric CO2, with a net ecosystem production (NEP) of 78.5, 91.7, and 192.5 g C m-2 yr-1 in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. The prominent, high NEP in 2004 resulted from the combination of high gross primary production (GPP) and low ecosystem respiration (Re) during the growing season. The period of net absorption of CO2 in 2004, 179 days, was 10 days longer than that in 2002 and 5 days longer than that in 2003. Moreover, the date on which the mean air temperature first exceeded 5.0°C was 10 days earlier in 2004 (DOY110) than in 2002 or 2003. This date agrees well with that on which the green aboveground biomass (Green AGB) started to increase. The relationship between light-use efficiency and Green AGB was similar among the three years. In 2002, however, earlier senescence possibly caused low autumn GPP, and thus the annual NEP, to be lower. The low summertime Re in 2004 was apparently caused by lower soil temperatures and the relatively lower temperature dependence of Re in comparison with the other years. These results suggest that (1) the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau plays a potentially significant role in global carbon sequestration, because alpine meadow covers about one-third of this vast plateau, and (2) the annual NEP in the alpine meadow was comprehensively controlled by the temperature environment, including its effect on biomass growth. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Alpine ecosystem; Carbon dynamics; Eddy covariance; Global warming; Interannual variability","biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; global change; global warming; net ecosystem exchange; primary production; temperature effect; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,,,,,"Adams, J.M., Faure, H., Faure-Denard, L., Increases in terrestrial carbon storage from the last glacial maximum to the present (1990) Nature, 348, pp. 711-714; Amthor, J.S., Goulden, M.L., Mungeer, J.W., Testing a mechanistic model of forest-canopy mass and energy exchange using eddy correlation: Carbon dioxide and ozone uptake by a mixed oak-maple stand (1994) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 21, pp. 623-651; Angert, A., Biraud, S., Bonfils, C., Drier summers cancel out the CO2 uptake enhancement induced by warmer springs (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102, pp. 10823-10827; Aubinet, M., Grelle, A., Ibrom, A., Estimates of the annual net carbon and water vapor exchange of forests: The EUROFLUX methodology (2000) Advances in Ecological Research, 30, pp. 113-175; Baldocchi, D., Falge, E., Olson, R., FLUXNET: A new tool to study the temporal and spatial variability of ecosystem-scale carbon dioxide, water vapor and energy flux densities (2001) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 82, pp. 2415-2434; Cao, G., Tang, Y., Mo, W., Grazing intensity alters soil respiration in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau (2004) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 36, pp. 237-243; Carrara, A., Kowalski, A.S., Neirynck, J., Net ecosystem CO2 exchange of mixed forest in Belgium over 5 years (2003) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 119, pp. 203-227; Derner, J.D., Beriske, D.D., Boutton, T.W., Does grazing mediate soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation beneath C4, perennial grasses along an environmental gradient?
