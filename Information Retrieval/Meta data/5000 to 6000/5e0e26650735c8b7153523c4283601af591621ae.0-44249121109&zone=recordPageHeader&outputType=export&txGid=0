However, the spatial variability of phenological changes, as well as their intraspecific consistency, remains largely unexplored. Here we analysed 672 estimates of change in first arrival dates of migratory birds and 289 estimates of mean/median arrival dates, based on time series with a minimum duration of 15 yr, collected across Europe from 1960 to 2006. There were highly significant advances in arrival date, significantly more so for first than mean arrival date. Change in arrival dates significantly varied among species, implying that response to climate change is a species-specific feature, and showed substantial phylogenetic effects, since ca. 50 % of the variation in the observed trends was attributable to differences among species. The advance in first arrival date was weaker at extreme latitudes and stronger at intermediate latitudes, while geographic variation in mean arrival dates was less pronounced. Both first and mean arrival dates advanced the most for short- compared to long-distance migrants. These findings emphasize the reliability of estimates of phenological trends of avian species, which are therefore suitable to be included in comparative analyses aimed at identifying species-specific traits that favour adaptation to climatic changes. In addition, our results suggest that analyses of factors that have affected phenological responses to climate change should take into account spatial variation in the response, which could be due to spatial differences in the strength of climate change. © Inter-Research 2007.","First arrival date; Long-distance migrants; Median arrival date; Repeatability; Short-distance migrants","Birds; Climate change; Ecology; Population dynamics; Time series analysis; arrival date; bird; climate change; climate effect; geographical variation; intraspecific variation; migratory behavior; phenology; spring (season); Eurasia; Europe; Aves",,,,,,"Ahas, R., Aasa, A., The effects of climate change on the phenology of selected Estonian plant, bird and fish populations (2006) Int J Biometeorol, 51, pp. 17-26; Ahola, M., Laaksonen, T., Sippola, K., Eeva, T., Rainio, K., Lehikoinen, E., Variation in climate warming along the migration route uncouples arrival and breeding dates (2004) Glob Change Biol, 10, pp. 1610-1617; Barrett, R.T., The phenology of spring bird migration to north Norway (2002) Bird Study, 49, pp. 270-277; Berthold, P., Patterns of avian migration in light of current global 'greenhouse' effects: A central European perspective (1991) Acta Congr Int Ornithol, 20, pp. 780-786; Berthold, P., Helbig, A.J., Mohr, G., Querner, U., Rapid microevolution of migratory behavior in a wild bird species (1992) Nature, 360, pp. 668-670; Both, C., Comment on 'Rapid advance of spring arrival dates in long-distance migratory birds' (2007) Science, 315, pp. 598b; Both, C., te Marvelde, L., Climate change and timing of avian breeding and migration throughout Europe (2007) Clim Res, 35, pp. 93-105; Both, C., Artemyev, A.V., Blaauw, B., Cowie, R.J., and others, Large-scale geographical variation confirms that climate change causes birds to lay earlier (2004) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 271, pp. 1657-1662; Both, C., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.E., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Browne, S.J., Aebischer, N.J., Temporal changes in the migration phenology of turtle doves Streptopelia turtur in Britain, based on sightings from coastal bird observatories (2003) J Avian Biol, 34, pp. 65-71; Coppack, T., Both, C., Predicting life-cycle adaptation of migratory birds to global climate change (2002) Ardea, 90, pp. 369-378; Cotton, P.A., Avian migration phenology and global climate change (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 12219-12222; Cramp, S., (1998) The complete birds of the western Palearctic, , on CD-ROM.
