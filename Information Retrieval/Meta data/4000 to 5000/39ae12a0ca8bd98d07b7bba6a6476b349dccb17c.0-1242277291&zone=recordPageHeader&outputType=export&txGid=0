There was one trophic-level enrichment in bulk δ15N and δ13C signatures between small (&lt;20 mm long) and large (&gt;20 mm) specimens of N. marionis, suggesting distinct trophic differentiation among major shrimp size groups. Both δ15N and δ13C values of N. marionis increased with the depth, reflecting changes in their diet. There were no clear temporal trends in bulk δ15N signatures of N. marionis. However, compound-specific δ15N measurements of amino acids indicated that N. marionis from the inter-island realm occupied the trophic level of second order carnivores, while similarly sized shrimps in the near-shore realm were at the trophic level of first order carnivores. Compound-specific measurements also identified a change in the source of inorganic nitrogen at the base of the food web between the inter-island and near-shore realms. In contrast to the bulk δ15N values, a significant shift in bulk δ13C values of N. marionis was observed between 1984 and more recent years. This temporal change appears to be linked to changes in the overall productivity of the Prince Edward Island interisland system, which could be linked to global climate change.",,"carbon; crustacean; food web; isotopic analysis; nitrogen; spatiotemporal analysis; stable isotope; trophic level; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Marion Island; Prince Edward Islands; Southern Ocean; Caridea; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Hippolytidae",,,,,,"Ansorge, I.J., Lutjeharms, J.R.E., Twenty-five years of physical oceanographic research at the Prince Edward Islands (2000) S Afr J Sci, 96, pp. 557-565; Barnett, T.P., Pierce, D.W., Schnur, R., Detection of anthropogenic climate change in the world's oceans (2001) Science, 292, pp. 270-274; Bergstrom, D., Chown, S.L., Life at the front: History, ecology and change on southern ocean islands (1999) Trends Ecol Evol, 14, pp. 472-477; Bidigare, R.R., Fluegge, A., Freeman, K.H., Hanson, K.L., Hayes, J.M., Hollander, D., Jasper, J.P., Wakeham, S.G., Consistent fractionation of 13C in nature and in the laboratory: Growth-rate effects in some haptophyte algae (1997) Global Biochem Cycles, 11, pp. 279-292; Bligh, E.G., Dyer, W.J., A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification (1959) Can J Biochem Phys, 37, pp. 911-917; Branch, G.M., Attwood, C.G., Gianakouras, D., Branch, M.L., Patterns in the benthic communities on the shelf of the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (1993) Polar Biol, 13, pp. 23-34; Burger, A.E., Lindeboom, H.J., Williams, A.J., The mineral and energy contributions of guano of selected species of birds to the Marion Island terrestrial ecosystem (1978) S Afr J Antarct Res, 8, pp. 59-70; Burkhardt, S., Riebesell, U., Zondervan, I., Effects of growth rate, CO2 concentration, and cell size on the stable carbon isotope fractionation in marine phytoplankton (1999) Geochim Cosmochim Acta, 63, pp. 3729-3741; Burkhardt, S., Riebesell, U., Zondervan, I., Stable carbon isotope fractionation by marine phytoplankton in response to daylength, growth rate and CO2 availability (1999) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 184, pp. 31-41; Chown, S.L., Smith, V.R., Climate change and the short-term impact of feral house mice at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (1993) Oecologia, 96, pp. 508-516; Crawford, R.J.M., Hurford, J., Greyling, M., Nel, D.C., Population size and trends of some seabirds at Marion Island (1998) NZ Nat Sci, 23 (SUPPL.), p. 42; Fogel, M.L., Cifuentes, L.A., Velinsky, D.J., Sharp, J.H., Relationship of carbon availability in estuarine phytoplankton to isotopic composition (1992) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 82, pp. 291-300; Fry, B., Sherr, E.B., δ13C measurements as indicators of carbon flow in marine and freshwater ecosystems (1984) Contrib Mar Sci, 27, pp. 13-47; Gille, S.T., Warming of the Southern Ocean since the 1950s (2002) Science, 295, pp. 1275-1277; Hunt, B.P.V., Pakhomov, E.A., McQuaid, C.D., Short-term variation and long-term changes in the oceanographic environment and zooplankton community in the vicinity of a sub-Antarctic archipelago (2001) Mar Biol, 138, pp. 369-381; Ismail, H.E., Surface nutrients in the vicinity of the Prince Edward Islands during April/May 1989 (1990) S Afr J Antarct Res, 20, pp. 33-36; Kaehler, S., Pakhomov, E.A., McQuaid, C.D., Trophic structure of the marine food web at the Prince Edward Islands (Southern Ocean) as determined by δ13C and δ 15N analysis (2000) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 208, pp. 13-20; Kooyman, G.L., Evolutionary and ecological aspects of some Antarctic and sub-Antarctic penguin distributions (2002) Oecologia, 130, pp. 485-495; Kroopnick, P.M., The distribution of 13C of ΣCO2 in the world oceans (1985) Deep-Sea Res, 32, pp. 57-84; Laws, E.A., Bidigare, R.R., Popp, B.N., Effect of growth rate and CO2 concentration on carbon isotopic fractionation by the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (1997) Limnol Oceanogr, 42, pp. 1552-1560; Levitus, S., Antonov, J.I., Boyer, T.P., Stephens, C., Warming of the world ocean (2000) Science, 287, pp. 2225-2229; Levitus, S., Antonov, J.I., Wang, J., Delworth, T.L., Dixon, K.W., Broccoli, A.J., Anthropogenic warming of earth's climate system (2001) Science, 292, pp. 267-270; McClelland, J.W., Montoya, J.P., Trophic relationships and the nitrogen isotopic composition of amino acids in plankton (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 2173-2180; Metges, C.C., Retzke, K., Hennig, U., Gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometric composition of N-acetyl- and N-pivaloyl amino acid esters to measure 15N isotopic abundances in physiological samples: A pilot study on amino acid synthesis in the upper gastro-intestinal tract of minipigs (1996) J Mass Spectrom, 31, pp. 367-376; Michener, R.H., Schell, D.M., Stable isotope ratios as tracers in marine aquatic food webs (1994) Stable Isotopes in Ecology and Environmental Science, pp. 138-157. , Lajtha K, Michener RH (eds).
