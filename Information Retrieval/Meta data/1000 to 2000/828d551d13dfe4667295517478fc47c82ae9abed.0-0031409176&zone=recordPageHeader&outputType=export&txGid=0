Sites ranged from frozen peat plateaux and palsas with collapse scars to fens and bogs and ponds. Mean summer CH 4 emissions ranged from -1.3 to 255 mg m -2 d -1, and the variation among sites was best explained by mean water table position (r 2 = 0.62, n = 19). Large CH 4 fluxes (&gt;30 mg md -1) and high water tables occurred in ponds and graminoid sites, whereas small fluxes (&lt;30 mg m -2 d -1) and low water tables occur in shrub and woody sites. These relationships were upheld across several northern boreal regions, based on water table depth and broad ecological criteria. CH 4 turnover times were generated by comparing surficial fluxes and storage within the saturated portion of the peat profile. Graminoid sites had CH 4 turnover times from 1 to 4 days, whereas shrub or woody sites had longer turnover times, ranging from weeks to years. We estimated an overall flux of ∼ 18 mg m -2 d -1 for the landscape around Fort Simpson. This CH 4 flux may increase with the onset of global warming, owing to the fragility of permafrost, resulting in the formation of collapse scars with high CH 4 emission rates.",,"methane flux; permafrost; wetlands; Canada, Northwest Territories, Fort Simpson",,,,,,"Aylsworth, J.M., Kettles, I.M., Todd, B.J., Peatland distribution in the Fort Simpson area, Northwest Territories with a geophysical study of peatland-permafrost relationships at Antoine Lake (1993) Current Reseach, Part E, Pap.
