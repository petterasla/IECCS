Global climatic model has been run prediction on monthly basis for the southern Mediterranean part of the Country (Popovo Polje) the percentage decrease of precipitation (25%) and air temperatures increase (2 °C) with respect to mean monthly values for the last fouty years. In our paper we would like just to test how this change could exert influence on the future soil water stress.","Climate change; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Modeling; Precipitation; Prediction",,,,,,,"Custovic, H., Vlahinic, M., (2002) Frequency and Tendency of Drought in the Karst Area of the South of Herzegovina, , Bled, ICID International Conference; Mikulec, V., Stehlová, K., Application of the climate change scenarios on selected meteorological characteristics for the purpouses of water content course prognosis in time horizons 2010, 2030 and 2075 (2006) Cereal Research Communications, 34, pp. 45-48; Stekauerová, V., Nagy, V., The influence of extreme meteorological phenomena on soil water regime of lowlands (2007) Cereal Research Communications, 35 (2), pp. 1097-1100; Stehlová, K., Assessment of the soil water storage with regard to prognosis of the climate change at lowlands (2007) Cereal Research Communications, 35 (2), pp. 1093-1096; Thornthwaite, C.W., (1958) The Water Balance, WMO, , Beograd; Vlahinic, M., Custovic, H., Alagic, E., (2002) Situation of Drought in Bosnia and Herzegovina, , Bled, ICID International Conference; Mikulec, V., Stehlová, K., Application of the climate change scenarios on selected meteorological chaacteristics for the purposes of water content course prognosis in time horizons 2010, 2030 and 2075 (2006) Cereal Research Communications, 34, pp. 145-49","Custovic, H.; Faculty og Agriculture and Food Sciences, University of Sarajevo, St. Zmajam od Bosne 8, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina; email: custovic.hamid@gmail.com",,,,,,,,01333720,,CRCMC,,"English","Cereal Res.
