For both CH4 and N2O, we observed uptake and emission ranging from -160 to 245 μg CH4 m-2 h-1 and -52 to 21 μg N2O m-2 h-1, respectively (negative values indicate uptake). Mean fluxes from mid-April to mid-December across the 4, 17, 32, 67 years old stands were similar for CO2 fluxes (259, 246, 220, and 250 mg CO2 m-2 h-1, respectively), without pattern for N2O fluxes (-3.7, 1.5, -2.2, and -7.6 μg N2O m-2 h-1, respectively), whereas the uptake rates of CH4 increased with stand age (6.4, -7.9, -10.8, and -23.3 μg CH4 m-2 h-1, respectively). For the same period, the combined contribution of CH4 and N2O exchanges to the global warming potential (GWP) calculated from net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and aggregated soil exchanges of CH4 and N2O was on average 4%, &lt;1%, &lt;1%, and 2% for the 4, 17, 32, 67 years old stand, respectively. Soil CO2 fluxes correlated positively with soil temperature but had no relationship with soil moisture. We found no control of soil temperature or soil moisture on CH4 and N2O fluxes, but CH4 emission was observed following summer rainfall events. LFH layer removal reduced CO2 emissions by 43%, increased CH4 uptake during dry and warm soil conditions by more than twofold, but did not affect N2O flux. We suggest that significant alternating sink and source potentials for both CH4 and N2O may occur in N- and soil water-limited forest ecosystems, which constitute a large portion of forest cover in temperate areas. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Afforestation; Chronosequence; Climate change; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas; Litter removal; Temperate conifer forest","afforestation; carbon dioxide; chronosequence; coniferous tree; forest cover; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; net ecosystem exchange; nitrous oxide; source-sink dynamics; temperate forest; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Coniferophyta; Pinus strobus",,,,,,"Aber, J.D., Goodale, C.L., Ollinger, S.V., et al, Is nitrogen deposition altering the nitrogen status of northeastern forests?
