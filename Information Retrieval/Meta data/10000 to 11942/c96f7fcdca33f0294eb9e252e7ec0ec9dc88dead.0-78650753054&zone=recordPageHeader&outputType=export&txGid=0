Ground source heat pumps (GSHP) are likely to play a central role in achieving this goal due to their high energy efficient performance. The efficiency of GSHP depends on the ground temperature, heating and cooling demands, and the distribution of heating and cooling over the year. However, all of these are affected by the ongoing climatic change. Consequently, global warming has direct effects on the GSHP performance. Within the framework of current study, heating and cooling demands of a reference building were calculated for different global warming scenarios in different climates i.e. cold, mild and hot climate. The prime energy required to drive the GSHP system is compared for each scenario and two configurations of ground heat exchangers. Current study shows that the ongoing climatic change has significant impact on GSHP systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Degree hour; Global warming; Ground source heat pump; Thermal performance","Climatic changes; Degree hour; Global energy; Ground heat exchangers; Ground source heat pump; Ground temperature; Heating and cooling systems; High energy; Hot climate; Reduction in energy consumption; Significant impacts; Thermal Performance; Cooling systems; Energy utilization; Global warming; Heat pump systems; Heating; Mixed convection; Pumps; Energy efficiency; building; cooling; energy efficiency; global warming; heat transfer; heating; monitoring; performance assessment",,,,,,"Deming, D., Climatic warming in North America: analysis of borehole temperatures (1995) Science, 268 (5217), pp. 1576-1577; Harris, R.N., Chapman, D.S., Borehole temperatures and a baseline for 20th-century global warming estimates (1997) Science, 275 (5306), pp. 1618-1621; Lachenbruch, A.H., Marshall, B.V., Changing climate: geothermal evidence from permafrost in the Alaskan Arctic (1986) Science, 234 (4777), pp. 689-696; (NCDC)*N.C.D.C.*N.O.a.A.A.(NOAA) (2008) Global surface temperature anomalies, , http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/anomalies/index.html, Available from; Peterson, T.C., Baringer, M.O., Thorne, P.W., Menne, M.J., Kennedy, J.J., Christy, J., State of the climate in 2008 (2009) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 90 (8), pp. S13; Nordell, B., Thermal pollution causes global warming (2003) Global and Planetary Change, 38 (3-4), pp. 305-312; Nordell, B., Gervet, B., Global energy accumulation and net heat emission (2009) International Journal of Global Warming, 1, pp. 373-391. , 1/2/3; IEA (2007) Renewables for heating and cooling, , http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2007/Renewable_Heating_Cooling_Final_WEB.pdf, Available from; Seyboth, K., Beurskens, L., Langniss, O., Sims, R.E.H., Recognising the potential for renewable energy heating and cooling (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (7), pp. 2460-2463; Hepbasli, A., Thermodynamic analysis of a ground-source heat pump system for district heating (2005) International Journal of Energy Research, 29 (7), pp. 671-687; Kharseh, M., (2009) Reduction of prime energy consumption in the Middle East by GSHP systems, , Department of Civil, Mining and Environmental Engineering, Luleå University of Technology, Luleå, p. 148; Kharseh, M., Nordell, B., Sustainable heating and cooling systems for agriculture.
