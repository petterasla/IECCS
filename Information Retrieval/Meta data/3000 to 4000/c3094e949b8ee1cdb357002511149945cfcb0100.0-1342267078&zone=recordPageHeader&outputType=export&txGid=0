The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences worldwide precipitation patterns and has occurred with regular periodicity over the last 130 000 years. We hypothesized that ENSO, through effects on local weather conditions, has influenced frequency and extent of fires within Everglades National Park (Florida, USA). Using data from 1948 to 1999, we found that the La Nina phase of ENSO was associated with decreased dry-season rainfall, lowered surface water levels, increased lightning strikes, more fires, and larger areas burned. In contrast, the El Niño phase was associated with increased dry-season rainfall, raised surface water levels, decreased lightning strikes, fewer fires, and smaller areas burned. Shifts between ENSO phases every few years have likely influenced vegetation through periodic large-scale fires, resulting in a prevalence of fire-influenced communities in the Everglades landscape.","Area burned; El Niño; ENSO; Everglades; Fire; Florida; Global warming; La Niña; Lightning; Savannas; SOI; Wet/dry season","climate change; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; fire history; La Nina; rainfall; water level; Everglades National Park; Florida; North America; United States",,,,,,"Allan, R.J., Lindesay, J., Parker, D.E., (1996) El Niño Southern Oscillation and Climatic Variability, , CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Victoria, Australia; Baisan, C.H., Swetnam, T.W., Fire history on a desert mountain range: Rincon Mountain Wilderness, Arizona, U.S.A.
