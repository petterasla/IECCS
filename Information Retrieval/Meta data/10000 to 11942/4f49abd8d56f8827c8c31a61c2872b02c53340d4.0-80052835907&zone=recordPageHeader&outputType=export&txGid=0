This may also affect the atmosphere-biosphere exchange of radiatively important greenhouse gases (GHGs), e.g. methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) from soil. A study was carried out during July to November of 2007 and 2008 in the experimental farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to assess the effects of elevated tropospheric ozone on methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice (Oryza sativa L.) soil. Rice crop was grown in open top chambers (OTC) under elevated ozone (EO), non-filtered air (NF), charcoal filtered air (CF) and ambient air (AA). Seasonal mean concentrations of O 3 were 4.3±0.9, 26.2±1.9, 59.1±4.2 and 27.5±2.3 ppb during year 2007 and 5.9±1.1, 37.2±2.5, 69.7±3.9 and 39.2±1.8 ppb during year 2008 for treatments CF, NF, EO and AA, respectively. Cumulative seasonal CH4 emission reduced by 29.7% and 40.4% under the elevated ozone (EO) compared to the nonfiltered air (NF), whereas the emission increased by 21.5% and 16.7% in the charcoal filtered air (CF) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Cumulative seasonal emission of N 2O ranged from 47.8mgm -2 in elevated ozone to 54.6mgm -2 in charcoal filtered air in 2007 and from 46.4 to 62.1mgm -2 in 2008. Elevated ozone reduced grain yield by 11.3% and 12.4% in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Global warming potential (GWP) per unit of rice yield was the least under elevated ozone levels. Dissolved organic C content of soil was lowest under the elevated ozone treatment. Decrease in availability of substrate i.e., dissolved organic C under elevated ozone resulted in a decline in GHG emissions. Filtration of ozone from ambient air increased grain yield and growth parameters of rice and emission of GHGs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Charcoal filtration; Elevated ozone; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas emission; Non-filtered air; Rice yield","agricultural emission; ambient air; crop plant; crop yield; filtration; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; ozone; paddy field; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; substrate; troposphere; India; Oryza sativa",,,,,,"Andersen, C., Source-sink balance and carbon allocation below ground in plants exposed to ozone (2003) New Phytol, 157, pp. 213-228; Ariyaphanphitak, W., Chidthaisong, A., Sarobol, E., Bashkin, V., Towprayoon, S., Effects of elevated ozone concentrations on Thai jasmine rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.)
