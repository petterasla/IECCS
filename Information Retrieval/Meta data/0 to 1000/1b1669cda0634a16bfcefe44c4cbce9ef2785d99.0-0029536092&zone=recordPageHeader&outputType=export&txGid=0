However, the spatial inhomogeneity of sulfate aerosols may induce climate responses which differ other than just in sign from those induced by increased concentrations of the more homogeneously distributed greenhouse gases. Here we use a general circulation model to further examine the suitability of global mean radiative forcing as a predictor of differences in global, hemispheric, and regional climate responses to differing spatial and temporal forcing patterns. In global and annual mean the negative aerosol forcing may be viewed as a scaleable anti-greenhouse forcing. -from Authors",,"greenhouse gas; radiative forcing; sulphate aerosol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029536092
