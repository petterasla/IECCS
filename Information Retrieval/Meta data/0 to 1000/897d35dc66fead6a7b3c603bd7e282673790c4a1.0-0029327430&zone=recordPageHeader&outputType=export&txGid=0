The first of these is a Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) plant featuring CO2 separation and disposal to a disused gas well. The second is an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant featuring CO2 separation and disposal to the deep ocean. The third case is a pulverised fuel plant with flue gas desulphurisation (PF+FGD) with CO2 capture by a managed forest at a site remote from the power plant. A wide variety of impacts have been assessed at local, regional and global scales. They include accidents affecting workers and the public, the effects of atmospheric emissions on health and buildings and the impacts of global warming. Issues associated with management of the forest designed to capture CO2 from the PF plant and assessment of the associated costs are also described. © 1995.",,"Coal gasification plants; Combined cycle power plants; Desulfurization; Environmental impact; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Global warming; Ocean dumping; Revegetation; Separation; Afforestation; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide disposal; Coal fired integrated gasification combined cycle plant; Full Fuel Cycles Study; IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme; Natural gas combined cycle gas turbine plant; Pulverized coal fired supercritical steam turbine plant; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"H.
