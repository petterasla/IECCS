Drylands generally have poor fertility and little organic matter and hence are candidates for C sequestration. Carbon storage in the soil profile not only improves fertility but also abates global warming. Several soils, production, and management factors influence C sequestration, and it is important to identify production and management factors that enhance C sequestrations in dryland soils. The objective of the present study was to examine C stocks at 21 sites under ongoing rainfed production systems and management regimes over the last 25 years on dominant soil types, covering a range of climatic conditions in India. Organic C stocks in the soil profiles across the country showed wide variations and followed the order Vertisols > Inceptisols > Alfisols > Aridisols. Inorganic C and total C stocks were larger in Vertisols than in other soil types. Soil organic C stocks decreased with depth in the profile, whereas inorganic C stocks increased with depth. Among the production systems, soybean-, maize-, and groundnut-based systems showed greater organic C stocks than other production systems. However, the greatest contribution of organic C to total C stock was under upland rice system. Organic C stocks in the surface layer of the soils increased with rainfall (r = 0.59*), whereas inorganic C stocks in soils were found in the regions with less than 550 mm annual rainfall. Cation exchange capacity had better correlation with organic C stocks than clay content in soils. Results suggest that Indian dryland soils are low in organic C but have potential to sequester. Further potential of tropical soils to sequester more C in soil could be harnessed by identifying appropriate production systems and management practices for sustainable development and improved livelihoods in the tropics. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon sequestration; Dryland cropping systems; India; Inorganic carbon; Organic carbon; Total carbon stocks","annual cycle; carbon sequestration; cropping practice; dryland farming; global warming; ion exchange; rainfed agriculture; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil management; soil nutrient; soil profile; soil quality; soil type; sustainable development; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Arachis hypogaea; Glycine max; Zea mays",,,,,,"Allmaroas, R.R., Linden, D.R., Clapp, C.E., Corn residue transformation into root and soil carbon as related to nitrogen, tillage, and stover management (2004) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 68, pp. 1366-1375; Batjes, N.H., Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world (1996) European Journal of Soil Science, 47, pp. 151-163; Bhattacharya, T., Pal, D.K., Mandal, C., Velayutham, M., Organic carbon stock in Indian soils and their geographical distribution (2000) Current Science, 79, pp. 655-660; Bhattacharya, T., Pal, D.K., Velayutham, M., Chandran, P., Mandal, C., Soil organic and inorganic carbon stocks in the management of black cotton soils of Maharashtra (2001) Clay Research, 20, pp. 11-20; Bilbro, J.D., Undersander, D.J., Fryrear, D.W., Lester, C.M., A survey of lignin, cellulose, and acid detergent fiber ash contents of several plants and implications for wind erosion control (1991) Journal of Soil Water Conservation, 46, pp. 314-316; (1981) Carbon Cycle Modelling, , Biolin, B.
