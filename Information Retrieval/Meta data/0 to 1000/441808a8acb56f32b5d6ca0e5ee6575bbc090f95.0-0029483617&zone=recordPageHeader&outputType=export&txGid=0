However, the use of the GWP index is still subject to major conceptual difficulties. Here we revise and generalize this index and then apply our alternative index to the case of emissions from some hydroelectric reservoirs in Brazil. Our results suggest that, though the cumulative heating effects of emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs may be far from negligible, for the cases studied hydroelectricity in general contributes less to the greenhouse effect over a long time horizon than fossil fuelled electricity generation. © 1995.","Global warming potential index; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hydroelectric reservoirs","developing country; global warming potential index; greenhouse effect; hydroelectric reservoir; methodological analysis; pollution monitoring",,,,,,"Brown, Lugo, Biomass of tropical forests: a new estimate based on forest volumes (1984) Science, 223, pp. 1290-1293; Chao, Man-made lakes and sea-level rise (1994) Nature, 370 (6487), p. 258; Donner, Ramanathan, Methane and nitrous oxide: their effects on the terrestrial climate (1980) Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 37 (1), pp. 119-124; Fearnside, Deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia as source of greenhouse gases (1990) Regional Conference on Global Warming, , USP, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Fearnside, Forest biomass in Brazilian Amazonia: comments on the estimate by Brown and Lugo (1992) Interciencia, 17 (1), p. 1927; Franken, Vierssen, Lubberding, Emissions of some greenhouse gases from aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems in the Netherlands and options to control them (1992) The Science of the Total Environment, 126 (3), pp. 277-293; Gilliland, Klopatek, Hildebrand, Net energy: results for small-scale hydroelectric power and summary of existing analyses (1981) Energy, 6 (10), pp. 1029-1040; Gleick, Environmental consequences of hydroelectric development: the role of facility size and type (1992) Energy, 17 (8), pp. 735-747; Gusdorf, Energy paybacks and renewable breeders (1992) Energy, 17 (12), pp. 1137-1151; Hansen, Fung, Lacis, Rind, Lebedeff, Ruedy, Russel, Stone, Global climate changes as forecast by Goddard Institute for Space Studies three-dimensional model (1988) Journal of Geophysical Research, 93, pp. 9341-9364; Harvey, A guide to global warming potentials (GWPs) (1993) Energy Policy, 21 (1), pp. 24-34; Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Houghton, Callander, Varney, (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Isaksen, Ramaswamy, Rodhe, Wigley, (1992) Radiative forcing of climate, pp. 47-67. , Houghton et al., 1992; Lashof, Ahuja, Relative contributions of greenhouse gas emissions to global warming (1990) Nature, 344 (6266), pp. 529-531; Leggett, Pepper, Swart, (1992) Emissions scenarios for the IPCC: an update, pp. 69-95. , Houghton et al; Lele, Subramanian, A hydro-wood net-energy approach to hydro project design (1988) Energy, 13 (4), pp. 367-381; Lelieveld, Crutzen, Indirect chemical effects of methane on climate warming (1992) Nature, 355 (6358), pp. 339-342; Marland, Carbon dioxide emission rates for conventional and synthetic fuels (1983) Energy, 8 (12), pp. 981-992; Ministério das Minas e Energia (MME), Brazil, (1993) Balanço Energético 1993, p. 111. , Brasília; Mortimer, Energy analysis of renewable energy sources (1991) Energy Policy, 19 (4), pp. 374-385; Oud, Global warming: a changing climate for hydro (1993) Water Power & Dam Construction, pp. 20-23; Ramanathan, Radiative transfer within the earth's troposphere and stratosphere: a simplified radiative-convective model (1976) Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 33, pp. 1330-1346; Rodenburg, (1994) Nature, 370 (6487), p. 258; Rodhe, A comparison of the contribution of various gases to the greenhouse effect (1990) Science, 248 (4960), pp. 1217-1219; Rosa, Schaeffer, Brazilian energy policy (1990) Hydroelectric Dams on Brazil's Xingu River and Indigenous Peoples, pp. 47-52. , L.A.O.
