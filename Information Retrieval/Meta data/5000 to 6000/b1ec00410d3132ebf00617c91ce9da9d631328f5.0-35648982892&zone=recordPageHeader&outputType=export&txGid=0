The specimen is the first individual collected in eastern North America in over fourteen years and is only the sixth of its species known to be collected anywhere in North America in the last ten years. This discovery reopens questions regarding the current status of this once common species. Interactions with exotic species, global climate change, and shifting land use patterns have all been postulated as possible factors in this species decline. This discovery is the first in a new program in the USA designed to educate the public regarding biodiversity and conservation and to engage them in a survey of native and exotic lady beetle species. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Biodiversity; Citizen science; Conservation; Invasive species; Rare ladybeetle","beetle; biodiversity; population decline; rare species; species conservation; Arlington; North America; United States; Virginia; Coccinella; Coleoptera",,,,,,"Adriaens, T., Branquart, E., Maes, D., The multicoloured Asian ladybird Harmonis axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a threat for native aphid predators in Belgium?
