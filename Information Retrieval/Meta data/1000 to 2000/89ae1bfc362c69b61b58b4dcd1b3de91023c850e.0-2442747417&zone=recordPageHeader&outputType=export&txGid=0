Deforestation is a major land use change in the tropics, with forest resources undergoing degradation through the influence of logging and conversion to other uses. Land use change is a product of varied local and regional resource use policies. Management of forest resources is one such major temporal factor, influencing resource stability and the carbon pool. Under a given management policy, both the long period of forest growth, and the slow turnover and decay of the carbon pool, enhance the relevance of stand level management policies as cost-effective mechanisms mitigating climate change. Apart from regional level uncertainties like the nature of land use and the estimation of carbon storage in vegetation and soil, the carbon flux of tropical forests is greatly influenced by uncertainty in regenerative capacity of forests and in harvest and management policies. A case study from India is used to develop a transition matrix model of natural forest management, and to explore the economic implications of maintaining and expanding existing carbon sinks. The study further explores the significance of investments in additional carbon sinks in plantation forests, given continued uncertainty in natural forest management.",,"carbon sequestration; forest management; nature conservation; uncertainty role",,,,,,"Arrow, K.J., Fisher, A.C., Environmental Preservation, Uncertainty and Irreversibility (1974) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 88, pp. 312-319; Binkley, C.S., Van Kooten, K.C., Integrating Climate Change and Forests: Economic and Ecological Assessments (1994) Climate Change, 28, pp. 91-110; Brown, S., Sadhe, J., Cannell, M., Kauppi, P.E., Management of Forests for Mitigation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (1996) Second Assessment Report, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Working Group II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Buongiorno, J., Mitchie, B.R., A Matrix Model of Uneven Aged Forest Management (1980) Forest Science, 26, pp. 609-625; Clark, C.W., (1976) Mathematical Bioeconomics, , Wiley, New York; Cline, W.R., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC; Cline, W.R., Give Greenhouse Abatement a Chance (1993) Finance and Development, 30 (1), pp. 3-5; Costa, P.M., Forestry Practices for Carbon Sequestration: A Review and Case Study from South East Asia (1996) Ambio, 25, pp. 279-283; Cox, D., Oakes, R., (1984) Analysis of Survival Data, , Chapman and Hall, London; Fankhauser, S., (1995) Valuing Climate Change, , Earthscan, London; Fearnside, P.M., Brazil's Amazon Forest and the Global Carbon Problem (1985) Intersciencia, 10 (4), pp. 185-203; Fearnside, P., Fires in the Tropical Rain Forests of the Amazon Basin (1990) Fire in the Tropical Biota: Ecosystem Processes and Global Challenges, pp. 106-116. , Goldammer, J.
