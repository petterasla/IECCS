At present automotive industry looks at carbon dioxide (CO2; R744) as the refrigerant of the future. Apart from the environmental benefits discussed are the technical characteristics of carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle and mobile air-conditioning systems in comparison to R134a refrigerant. Analyzed are challenges emerged from the use of CO2 as refrigerant and improvement opportunities in regards to increase of the system performance and efficiency. Particular attention is dedicated to the advantages of CO2 utilization in prospective automotive heat pump systems.","Air conditioning; CO2 (R744); Global warming potential; Heat pump; R134a; Refrigerant; Transcritical cycle",,,,,,,"Vesovic, V., The Transport Properties of Carbon Dioxide (1990) Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data, 19 (3), pp. 763-808; Choi, K.I., Boiling Heat Transfer of R-22, R-1 34a and CO2 in Horizontal Smooth Minichannels (2007) International Journal of Refrigeration, 30 (8), pp. 1336-1346; Pettersen, J., Rieberer, R., Leister, A., (2000) Heat Transfer and Pressure Drop Characteristics of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide in Microchannel Tubes under Cooling, Proceedings, pp. 99-106. , 4th IIR Gustav Lorenzen Conference on Natural Working Fluids, West Lafayette, Ind., USA; Pitla, S., Convective Heat Transfer from in Tube Flow of Turbulent Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Part 1 Numerical Analysis (2001) International Journal HVAC&R Research, 7 (4), pp. 345-366; Pitla, S., Groll, E., Ramadhyani, S., Convective Heat Transfer from in Tube Flow of Turbulent Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Part 2 Experimental Data and Numerical Predictions (2001) International Journal HVAC&R Research, 7 (4), pp. 367-382; Liao, S., Zhao, T., Measurements of Heat Transfer Coefficients from Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Flowing in Horizontal Mini/Meso Channels (2002) Journal of Heat Transfer, 124 (3), pp. 413-420; Lorentzen, G., Pettersen, J., (1992) New Possibilities for Non-CFC Refrigeration, pp. 147-163. , Proceedings, IIR International Symposium on Refrigeration, Energy and Environment, Trondheim Norway; Lorentzen, G., Revival of Carbon Dioxide as a Refrigerant (1993) International Journal of Refrigeration, 17 (5), pp. 292-301; Pettersen, J., Skaugen, G., (1994) Operation of Transcritical CO2 Vapour Compression Systems in Vehicle Air Conditioning, pp. 495-505. , Proceedings, International Conference on New Applications of Natural Working Fluids in Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, Hanover Germany; Billiard, F., The New European Regulation on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer Has Come into Force: What's New?
