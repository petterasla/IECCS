We used denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model baseline climate conditions and two future climate scenarios (2030 and 2050). Analyzed cropping systems included corn, rapeseed, and spring and winter wheat. It has been shown that an increase of temperature and decrease of precipitation can reduce net global warming potential (GWP) by 2% in the 2030 climate scenario and by 5% in the 2050 scenario in conventional tillage with reference to the baseline scenario. In the case of conservation tillage, a reduction of GWP by 5% and by 10% was estimated. The use of conservation tillage results decrease the GWP by 17-19% in the baseline scenario, in the 2030 scenario by 16-18%, and in the 2050 scenario by 15-17%. It also has been shown that change in climate conditions has declined biomass production of winter wheat and corn, which may suggest that a larger area would be needed for these crops to maintain production at the same level.","Carbon sequestration; DNDC; Greenhouse gas emission; Nitrous oxide; Tillage","Brassica napus; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",,,,,,"Solomon, S., Qin, D., Manning, M., Chen, Z., Marquis, M., Averyt, K.B., Tignor, M., Miller, H.L., Climate change 2007 the physical science basis, p. 2007. , Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Smith, K.A., Conene, F., Impacts of land management on fluxes of trace greenhouse gases (2004) Soil Use and Management, 20, p. 255; (2003) World Agriculture: Towards 2015/2030, p. 97. , FAO, An FAO Perspective, Rome; Beheydt, D., Boeckx, P., Sleutel, S., Li, C.H., Cleemput, O.V., Validation of DNDC for 22 long-term N2O filed emission measurements (2007) Atmospheric Environment, 41, p. 6196; Knowler, D., Bradshaw, B., Farmers' adoption of conservation agriculture: A review and synthesis of recent research (2007) Food Policy, 32, p. 25; Hillel, D., Rosenzweig, S., Soil and carbon climate change (2009) CSA News, 6, p. 54; Observations On the Communication Form the European Commission: Towards a Thematic Strategy For Soil Protection (COM (2002) 179 Final), , www.ecaf.org, EUROPEAN CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE FEDERATION (ECAF); Holland, J.M., The environmental consequence of adopting conservation tillage in Europe: Reviewing the evidence (2004) Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment, 103, p. 1; West, T.O., Post, W.M., Soil Organic carbon sequestration rates by tillage and crop rotation: A global analysis (2002) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 66, p. 1930; Li, T., Feng, Y., Li, X., Predicting crop growth under different cropping and fertilizing management practices (2009) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 149, p. 985; Farge, P.K., Ardo, J., Olsson, L., Rienzi, E.A., Pretty, J.N., The potential for soil carbon sequestration in the three tropical dryland farming systems of Africa and Latin America: A modeling approach (2007) Soil Tillage Res, 94, p. 457; Groenigen, K.J., Hastings, A., Forristal, D., Roth, B., Jones, M., Smith, P., Soil C storage as affected by tillage and straw management: An assessment using field measurements and model predictions (2010) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 140, p. 218; Grant, B., Smith, W.N., Desjardins, R., Lemke, R., Li, C., Estimated N2O and CO2 emissions as influenced by agricultural practices in Canada (2004) Climatic Change, 65, p. 315; Li, C., Frolking, S., Frolking, T.A., A model of nitrous-oxide evolution from soil driven by rainfall events.: 1 model structure and sensitivity (1992) Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres, 97, p. 9759; Giltrap, D.L., Li, C.H., Saggar, S., DNDC: A processbased model of greenhouse gas fluxes from agricultural soils (2010) Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment, 136, p. 292; Chen, D., Li, Y., Grace, P., Mosier, A.R., N2O emissions from agricultural lands: A synthesis of simulation approaches (2008) Plant Soil, 309, p. 169; Smith, P.D., Martino, Z., Cai, D., Gwary, D., Janzen, H., Kumar, P., McCarl, B., Sirotenko, O., Agriculture Climate Change 2007: Mitigation, p. 2007. , Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
