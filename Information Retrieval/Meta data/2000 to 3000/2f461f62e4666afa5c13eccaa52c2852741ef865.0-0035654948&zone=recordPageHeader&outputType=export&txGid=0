Results from atmospheric climate-model simulations constitute the atmospheric forcing, one representing present climate conditions (control simulation), and the other global warming due to CO2 doubling (scenario simulation). The present-day climatological ice conditions and the interannual variability were realistically reproduced by the ice-ocean model. The modelled range of the maximum annual ice extent in the Baltic was 190-420 × 103 km2 in the control simulation and 50-270 × 103 km2 in the scenario simulation. The range of the annual maximum level-ice thickness was 45-85 and 20-58 cm in the control and scenario simulations, respectively.",,"atmospheric forcing; modeling; sea ice; Baltic Sea",,,,,,"Haapala, J., On the modelling of ice-thickness redistribution (2000) J.
