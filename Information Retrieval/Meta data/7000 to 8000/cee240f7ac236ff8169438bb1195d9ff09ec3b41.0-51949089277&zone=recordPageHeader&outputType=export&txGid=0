A cradle-to-factory-gate life cycle assessment is performed with two important categories: the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil energy requirement per kg of bioplastics produced. The analysis indicates that PHA bioplastics contribute clearly to the goal of mitigating GHG emissions with only 0.49 kg CO2-e being emitted from production of 1 kg of resin. Compared with 2-3 kg CO2-e of petrochemical counterparts, it is about 80% reduction of the global warming potential. The fossil energy requirement per kg of bioplastics is 44 MJ, lower than those of petrochemical counterparts (78-88 MJ/kg resin). About 62% of fossil energy is used for processing utilities and wastewater treatment, and the rest is required for raw materials in different life cycle stages. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution; Biomass; Ethanol; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Reinforced plastics; Renewable energy resources; Bioplastics; Biorefineries; Cellulosic ethanol; Co-products; Eco-friendly; Fossil energies; GHG emissions; Green house gas emissions; Life cycle assessment); PHA bioplastics; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Value-added; Gas emissions; plastic; resin; biomass; emission; fossil; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; plastic; waste treatment; article; biomass; fossil energy; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; petrochemical industry; Biomass; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Petroleum; Plastics; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Sterilization; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions; Water Purification",,"Fossil Fuels; Petroleum; Plastics; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Vehicle Emissions",,,,"Perlack, R.
