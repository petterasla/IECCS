This paper presents estimation methods used for determining methane emissions from the management of wastewater. Applications for estimating countrywide methane gas emissions from wastewater management are presented with the country of Lebanon as an example. The relative significance of these emissions is assessed in comparison with methane emissions from developing and developed countries. Uncertainty associate with the estimation process and mitigation measures to reduce potential impacts of methane emissions from wastewater management are also discussed. © 2001 Esevier Science Ltd.","Anaerobic treatment; Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse gas; Methane emissions; Wastewater","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Wastewater management; Wastewater treatment; methane; article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; climate; developed country; developing country; greenhouse effect; Lebanon; methodology; waste water; waste water management; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Developing Countries; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Waste Disposal, Fluid",,"Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Alderman, B.J., Theis, T.L., Collins, A.G., Optimal design for anaerobic pretreatment of municipal wastewater (1998) Environmental Engineering, 124 (1), pp. 4-10; Augenbraum, H., Matthews, E., Sarma, D., (1999) The global methane cycle, , icp.giss.nasa.gov/research/methane.html; Blake, D.R., Methane role in atmospheric change (1994) SWANA'S 17th Annual International Landfill Gas Symposium, , Long Beach, CA; Calander, B., Scientific aspects of the framework convention on climate change and national greenhouse gas inventories (1995) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 38, pp. 129-140; Casey, T.J., (1997) Unit Treatment Processes in Water and Wastewater Engineering, , John Wiley, New York; (1998) Annual Progress Report, , Beirut, Lebanon; Czepiel, P.M., (1995) Radiatively active trace gas emissions from waste management systems, , PhD Dissertation, University of New Hampshire; Al-Handasah, D., (1997) National Industrial Waste Management Plan (Phase II report), , Ministry of Environment, Beirut, Lebanon; DeHollander, G.R., Gaseous emissions from wastewater facilities (1998) Water Environment Research, 70 (4), pp. 580-584; Doorn, M.R.J., Strait, R.P., Barnard, W.R., Eklund, B., (1997) Estimates of global greenhouse gas emissions from industrial and domestic wastewater treatment, EPA-600/R-97-019, , US EPA, Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division, Washington, DC; Droste, R.L., (1997) Theory and Practice of Water and Wastewater Treatment, , John Wiley, New York; Eklund, B., LaCosse, J., (1997) Field measurements of greenhouse gas emissions rates and development of emission factors for wastewater treatment, , USEPA, Office of Research and Development; El-Fadel, M., Findikakis, A., Leckie, J., Estimating and enhancing methane yield from municipal solid waste management (1996) Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials, 13, pp. 309-331; (1995) Assessment of the State of the Environment and Identification of Policy Options, , Council for Development and Reconstruction.
