The average Q10 values for the respiration rate ranged from about 1.0 at the highest temperature to more than 5 at 10°C to 15°C in the northernmost samples. In samples from more northern sites, respiration rates remained approximately constant during the whole incubation period; in the southern end of the transect, rates decreased over time. Respiration rate was positively correlated with incubation temperature, soil pH and C:N ratio, and negatively with soil total N. Regressions using all these variables explained approximately 71% of the total variability in the respiration rate. There was no clear relation between the nitrogen mineralization rate and incubation temperature. Below 15°C the N-mineralization rate did not respond to increasing temperature; at higher temperatures, significant increases were found for samples from some sites. A regression model including incubation temperature, pH, N(tot) and C:N explained 73% of the total variability in N mineralization. The estimated increase in annual soil respiration rates due to predicted global warming at the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere ranged from approximately 0.07 x 1015 to 0.13 x 1015 g CO2 at 2°C and 4°C temperature increase scenarios, respectively. Both values are greater than the current annual net carbon storage in northern forests, suggesting a switch of these ecosystems from net sinks to net sources of carbon with global warming.","Decomposition; Global warming; Humus; Nitrogen mineralization; Respiration; Scots pine; Soil organic matter; Temperature increase","biogeochemical cycle; climate change; humus; nitrogen cycle; temperature effect",,,,,,"Amelung, W., Flach, K.W., Zech, W., Climatic effects on soil organic matter composition in the great plains (1997) Soil Sci.
