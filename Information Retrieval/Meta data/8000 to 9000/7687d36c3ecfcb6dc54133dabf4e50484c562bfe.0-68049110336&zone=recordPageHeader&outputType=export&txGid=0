Our analysis reveals that its early (delayed) occurrence tends to follow the enhanced (suppressed) winter storm-track activity with less (more) apparent minimum in midwinter in the course of the seasonal march. A metric is defined on the basis of the eddy heat flux to measure the reproducibility of the particular seasonal march of the Far East stormtrack activity simulated in each of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 climate models under the present climate. Under a particular global warming scenario, ensemble projection based only on the several models that show the highest reproducibility of the storm-track activity measured with the particular metric indicates that the future enhancement is likely in the midwinter storm-track activity associated with the weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon, implying that Haru-Ichiban is likely to occur earlier in the late 21st century than in the 20th century. © 2009, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; data set; eddy; future prospect; global warming; heat flux; monsoon; seasonal variation; storm track; wind velocity; winter; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan",,,,,,"Chang, E.K.M., GCM and observational diagnoses of the seasonal and interannual variations of the Pacific storm track during the cold season (2001) J.
