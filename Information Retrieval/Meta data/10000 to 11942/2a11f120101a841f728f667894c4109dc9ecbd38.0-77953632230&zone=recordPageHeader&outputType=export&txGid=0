Using monthly precipitation data (1961-2003) from 45 meteorological stations in the study area, this paper analyzes characteristics and tendencies of annual and seasonal rainfall variations, and reveals multi-time scales structures of these time series through wavelet analyses; also, the periods of annual and seasonal precipitation series are identified, and the periodical oscillations and points of abrupt change at the principal period scale are discovered. The results show that annual precipitation varies in a large range, and has an ascending tendency at an increasing rate of 1.482 mm/10a; the multi-time scales periodical oscillations are clear; differences in tendencies, ranges and decadal precipitation anomalies exist within each decade during 1961-2000. The seasonal allocation of overall annual precipitation is extremely uneven; in terms of tendencies of seasonal precipitation, winter and spring have upward trends while summer and autumn have downward tendencies; distinctions in tendencies, ranges and decadal precipitation anomalies among each seasons are in existence within each decade during 1961-2000. The periodical oscillations of each seasonal precipitation time series are also evident. The research results not only provide convincing evidence for global climate change research, but also facilitate the understanding of specific natural process and pattern to make steps to rehabilitate and reconstruct vegetation, and contribute to fulfill the sustainability of water management. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Eco-geographical transition zone; Rainfall variations; The middle part of Inner Mongolia; Wavelet analysis","Abrupt change; Annual precipitation; Baotou City; Global climate changes; Inner Mongolia; Meteorological station; Multi-time scale; Natural process; Precipitation anomalies; Precipitation data; Rainfall variation; Research results; Seasonal precipitations; Seasonal rainfall; Study areas; The middle part of Inner Mongolia; Transition zones; Upward trend; Rain; Time series; Water management; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Climate change; climate change; decadal variation; ecozone; global climate; monitoring system; precipitation assessment; rainfall; sustainability; temporal variation; time series; timescale; water management; wavelet analysis; weather station; China; Nei Monggol",,,,,,"Anctil, F., Coulibaly, P., Wavelet analysis of the interannual variability in Southern Quebec streamflow (2004) J Clim, 17 (1), pp. 163-173; Andreo, B., Jiménez, P., Durán, J.J., Carrasco, F., Vadillo, L., Mangin, A., Climatic and hydrological variations during the last 117-116 years in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, from spectral and correlation analyses and continuous wavelet analyses (2006) J Hydrol, 314, pp. 312-329; Appenzeller, C., Stockerk, T.F., Anklin, M., North Atlantic oscillation dynamics recorded in Greenland ice cores (1998) Sci, 282, pp. 446-449; Cannarozzo, M., Noto, L.V., Viola, F., Spatial distribution of rainfall trends in Sicily (1921-2000) (2006) Phys Chem Earth, 31, pp. 1201-1211; Coulibaly, P., Spatial and temporal variability of Canadian seasonal precipitation (1900-2000) (2006) Adv Water Resour, 29, pp. 1846-1865; Delitala, A.M.S., Cesari, D., Chessa, P.A., Ward, M.N., Precipitation over Sardinia (Italy) during the 1946-1993 rainy seasons and associated large scale climate variations (2000) Int J Clim, 20, pp. 519-541; Ding, Y.H., Ren, G.Y., Shi, G.Y., Gong, P., Zheng, X.H., Zhai, P.M., Zhang, D.E., Dai, X.S., National assessment report of climate change (I): Climate change in China and its future trend (2006) Adv Clim Chang Res, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Feng, J.M., Liang, X., Zhang, Z., Xie, A., Analysis on multi-scale features of precipitation in east and middle part of Northwest China and West Inner Mongolia (2005) Sci Meteorol Sin, 25 (5), pp. 474-483; Fu, C.B., Ma, Z.G., Global change and regional aridification (2008) Chin J Atmos Sci, 32 (4), pp. 752-760; Geodalof, Z., Smith, D.J., Interdecadal climate variability and regime-scale shifts in Pacific North America (2001) Geophys Res Lett, 28, pp. 1515-1518; Grossman, A., Morlet, J., Decomposition of Hardy functions into square integrable wavelets of constant shape (1984) SIAM J Math Anal, 15, pp. 723-736; (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Kuang, Z., Ji, Z.Z., Lin, Y.H., Wavelet analysis of rainfall data in North China (2000) Clim Environ Res, 5 (3), pp. 312-317; Labat, D., Recent advances in wavelet analyses: Part 1.
