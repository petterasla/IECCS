Specifically, evidence has been presented favouring particular regions of the Earth having positive or negative correlations of cloud cover with respect to cosmic rays and to solar irradiation. In this work we examine the evidence critically from several standpoints and conclude that the evidence for a negative correlation of low and a positive correlation for middle cloud cover with solar irradiance (as measured by UV) over a significant fraction of the Earth (20-30%) is good. No other claimed correlations are supported. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
