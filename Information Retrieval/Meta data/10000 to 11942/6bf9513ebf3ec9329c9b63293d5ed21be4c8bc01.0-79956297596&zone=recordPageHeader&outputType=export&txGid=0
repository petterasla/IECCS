Continuously flooded conditions yielded two major flushes of methane emission and on an average resulted in relatively higher rate of methane emission (2.20 and 1.30 mg m-2 hr-1, respectively in 2005 and 2006) during the kharif season. The methane flux was reduced to half (1.02 and 0.47 mg m-2 hr1, respectively in 2005 and 2006) when rice fields were irrigated 2-3 days after infiltration of flood water into the soil. Irrigating the field at 0.15 bar matric potential reduced seasonal methane flux by 60% (0.99 and 0.41 mg m-2hr-1, respectively in 2005 and 2006) as compared to completely flooded conditions, without any decline in grain yield (60 q ha1). © 2011 Triveni Enterprises Vikas Nagar, Lucknow, INDIA.","Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane flux; Rice fields; Water regime","methane; best management practice; crop yield; emission control; flood; global warming; greenhouse gas; infiltration; irrigation; methane; paddy field; soil type; article; crop; irrigation (agriculture); rice; season; Agricultural Irrigation; Crops, Agricultural; Methane; Oryza sativa; Seasons",,"methane, 74-82-8; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"(2006) Statistical Abstract of Punjab, , Anonymous: Government of Punjab, Chandigarh, India; Cai, Z., Xu, H., Zhang, H., Jin, J., Estimation of methane emission from rice paddy fields in Taihu region (1994) Pedosphere, 4, pp. 297-306; Cai, Z.C., Xing, G.X., Yan, X.Y., Xu, H., Tsuruta, H., Yagi, K., Minami, K., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy fields as affected by nitrogen fertilizers and water management (1997) Pl.
