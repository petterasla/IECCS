Local adaptation to thermal gradients could cause populations in different parts of the range to respond differently. In aquatic systems, keeping pace with increased oxygen demand is the key parameter affecting species' response to higher temperatures. Therefore, respiratory performance is expected to vary between populations at different latitudes because they experience different thermal environments. We tested for geographical variation in respiratory performance of tropical marine fishes by comparing thermal effects on resting and maximum rates of oxygen uptake for six species of coral reef fish at two locations on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. The two locations, Heron Island and Lizard Island, are separated by approximately 1200 km along a latitudinal gradient. We found strong counter-gradient variation in aerobic scope between locations in four species from two families (Pomacentridae and Apogonidae). High-latitude populations (Heron Island, southern GBR) performed significantly better than low-latitude populations (Lizard Island, northern GBR) at temperatures up to 5 °C above average summer surface-water temperature. The other two species showed no difference in aerobic scope between locations. Latitudinal variation in aerobic scope was primarily driven by up to 80% higher maximum rates of oxygen uptake in the higher latitude populations. Our findings suggest that compensatory mechanisms in high-latitude populations enhance their performance at extreme temperatures, and consequently, that high-latitude populations of reef fishes will be less impacted by ocean warming than will lowlatitude populations. © 2010 Gardiner et al.",,"aerobic capacity; animal experiment; article; Australia; Chromis atripectoralis; Chromis viridis; controlled study; coral reef; Dascyllus aruanus; fish; geographic distribution; geographical variation (species); greenhouse effect; latitude; local adaptation; marine species; nonhuman; Ostorchinchus cyanosoma; Ostorchinchus doederleini; oxygen consumption; respiratory function; species difference; temperature sensitivity; animal; Anthozoa; breathing; comparative study; fish; physiology; temperature; Anthozoa; Apogonidae; Pisces; Pomacentridae; Squamata; sea water; Animals; Anthozoa; Fishes; Respiration; Seawater; Species Specificity; Temperature",,,,,,"Meehl, G.A., Stocker, T.F., Collins, W.D., Friedlingstein, P., Gaye, A.T., Global climate projections (2007) Climate Change 2007, pp. 748-845. , In: Solomon S, Qin D, Manning M, Chen Z, Marquis M, et al.
