The postcombustion capture (PCC) and storage of carbon dioxide (CO 2) produced from the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation is a key technology needed to achieve these reductions. The most mature technology for CO2 capture is reversible chemical absorption into an aqueous amine solution. In this study the results from measurements of the CO2 absorption capacity of aqueous amine solutions for 76 different amines are presented. Measurements were made using both a novel isothermal gravimetric analysis (IGA) method and a traditional absorption apparatus. Seven amines, consisting of one primary, three secondary,andthree tertiary amines,wereidentified as exhibiting outstanding absorption capacities. Most have a number of structural features in common including steric hindrance and hydroxyl functionality 2 or 3 carbons from the nitrogen. Initial CO2 absorption rate data from the IGA measurements was also used to indicate relative absorption rates. Most of the outstanding performers in terms of capacity also showed initial absorption rates comparable to the industry standard monoethanolamine (MEA). This indicates, in terms of both absorption capacity and kinetics, that they are promising candidates for further investigation. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption capacity; Absorption rates; Amine solutions; Carbon dioxide absorption; Chemical absorption; Climate effects; Electricity generation; Hydroxyl functionality; Industry standards; Key technologies; Monoethanolamine; Post-combustion; Rapid reduction; Steric hindrances; Structural feature; Tertiary amine; Amination; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Electric generators; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Gravimetric analysis; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Steelmaking; Gas absorption; 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol; 2 piperidineethanol; 2 piperidinemethanol; 3 piperidino 1,2 propanediol; 3 quinuclidinol; amine; carbamic acid; carbon; carbon dioxide; deanol; diisopropanolamine; ethanolamine; fossil fuel; nitrogen; unclassified drug; adsorption; ammonium compound; carbon dioxide; climate effect; combustion; emission control; global warming; gravimetry; greenhouse gas; nitrogen; reaction kinetics; absorption; aqueous solution; article; chemical structure; combustion; gravimetry; hydrogen bond; screening; stoichiometry; Absorption; Amines; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Remediation; Hydrogen Bonding; Time Factors",,"2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol, 115-69-5; 3 quinuclidinol, 1619-34-7; carbamic acid, 463-77-4; carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; deanol, 108-01-0, 2498-25-1; diisopropanolamine, 110-97-4; ethanolamine, 141-43-5; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Amines; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"(2007) Capturing CO2, p. 23. , IEA, IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Program: Cheltenham, UK; (2005) IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, p. 440. , IPCC, Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge; http://www.wri.org, WRI Climate Analysis Indicators Tool(2006) The Heat Is On: The Future of Energy in Australia, , CSIRO, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation: Canberra; Davison, J., Performance and costs of power plants with capture and storage of CO2 (2007) Energy, 32, pp. 1163-1176; (2004) Prospects for CO2 Capture and Storage, , IEA, OECD/IEA: Paris; McCann, N., Maeder, M., Attalla, M., Simulation of enthalpy and capacity of CO2 absorption by aqueous amine systems (2008) Ind.
