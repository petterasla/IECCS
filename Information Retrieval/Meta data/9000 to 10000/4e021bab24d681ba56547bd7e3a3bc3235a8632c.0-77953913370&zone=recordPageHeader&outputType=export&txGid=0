Conventional amine technologies being considered for separating CO2 from flue gas are costly, energy intensive, and if implemented, would result in large increases in the cost of producing electricity. Membranes offer potential as an energy-efficient, low-cost CO2 capture option. Recently, working with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), we have developed membranes with CO2 permeances of greater than 1000gpu and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 50 at 30°C. This permeance is ten times higher than commercial CO2 membranes and the selectivity is among the highest reported for non-facilitated transport materials. These membranes, in combination with a novel process design that uses incoming combustion air as a sweep gas to generate driving force, could meet DOE CO2 capture cost targets. Under these conditions, improving membrane permeance is more important than increasing selectivity to further reduce the cost of CO2 capture from flue gas. Membrane cost and reliability issues will be key to the eventual competitiveness of this technology for flue gas treatment. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide removal; CO2 capture; Coal; Flue gas; Membrane; Power plant","Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide removal; Combustion air; Cost targets; Driving forces; Energy efficient; Facilitated transport; Flue gas treatment; Global climate changes; Membrane permeance; Novel process; Post-combustion; Sweep gas; U.S. Department of Energy; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal combustion; Competition; Cost reduction; Flue gases; Flues; Gases; Power plants; Process engineering; Membranes; carbon dioxide; article; carbon dioxide capture; combustion; electric power plant; flue gas; gas permeability; membrane permeability; membrane technology; membrane transport; priority journal; process design",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M., van der Linden, P.J., Dai, X., Maskell, K., Johnson, C.A., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , Cambridge University Press, New York; (2007) The Future of Coal - Options for a Carbon Constrained World.
