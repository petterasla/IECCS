Such a system could help mitigate aviation's contribution to global climate change by enabling the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft. An electro-thermal motor sizing model was coupled with cycle analysis and weight estimation routines to create an automated environment for rapid design trade studies. The resulting parametric cycle analysis and sizing outcomes revealed the system's operational boundaries for a given aspiration space. © 2009 IEEE.","Ducted fan system; Electric-drive aeropropulsion; Superconducting motor","Cycle analysis; Ducted fan; Ducted fan system; Electric-drive aeropropulsion; Electrical machine; Global climate changes; Rapid design; Superconducting motor; Thermal motors; Weight estimation; Aircraft; Conceptual design; Electric motors; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Machine design; Superconductivity",,,,,,"Oberly, C.E., Air force applications of lightweight superconducting machinery (1977) IEEE Trans.
