The effects of water clouds are based on their microphysical and optical properties. Based on the studies of water clouds optical properties in 0.865 μm, the sensitivity of normalized radiance and polarized radiance intensities to water clouds optical parameters, such as effective radius, optical thickness and surface albedo, was evaluated by using vector radiative transfer model. The simulated results indicate that the information of multidirectional polarized radiance can show the microphysical and optical properties of water clouds effectively, which can be used to retrieve the properties of water clouds. This study provides the basis for using the remote sensing data of multi-angular polarization to retrieve the properties of water clouds was proposed.","Multi-angular polarized radiation; Vector radiative transfer; Water cloud microphysical parameter; Water cloud optical properties","Effective radius; Global climate changes; Multi-angular polarized radiation; Multi-directional; Optical parameter; Optical thickness; Polarized radiances; Polarized radiation; Radiation balance; Remote sensing data; Simulated results; Surface albedo; Vector radiative transfer; Vector radiative transfer models; Water cloud microphysical parameter; Water cloud optical properties; Water clouds; Water droplets; Climate change; Clouds; Earth (planet); Light transmission; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Optical properties",,,,,,"Richard, A.F., Bryan, A.B., Menzel, W.P., A comparison of cloud top heights computed from airborne lidar and MAS radiance data using slicing (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research, 104 (D20), pp. 547-555; Platnick, S., King, M.D., Ackerman, S.A., The MODIS cloud produces: Algorithms and examples from Terra (2003) IEEE Trans.
