It coincides closely in time with a strong global transgression called meltwater pulse 1a. One attempt at solution says that a meltwater pulse of Antarctic origin could cause an increase in North Atlantic Deep Water formation, and thus give rise to the Bølling interstadial. However, others have disputed that Antarctic meltwater would have that effect, and furthermore, the start of the Bølling interstadial is not even associated with an increase in North Atlantic Deep Water. A controversial hypothesis says that some Laurentian meltwater came from a jökulhlaup (sub-glacial outburst flood), but no study has yet shown unequivocally that sufficient amounts of water could be stored under the ice. Furthermore, according to all available data a melt-water pulse from the Laurentian ice would give rise to strong cooling, not warming. Nevertheless, meg-afloods appear instrumental in accumulating the Mississippi Fan, created entirely during the Quaternary period, and dramatic climate changes are characteristic of this period. This paper presents a hypothetical chain of events, building on the published literature and simple calculations, to investigate whether the order of magnitude is reasonable. The hypothesis is that a jökulhlaup from a Laurentian captured ice shelf flowed out through the Mississippi, boosted the Gulf Stream, reinvigorated the North Atlantic circulation, and as a result triggered the Bølling warm phase. © 2008 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.","Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration; Atmospheric methane concentration; Climate change; Climate forcing; Deglaciation; Ice age; Interstadial; Megaflood; Meltwater pulse; Mississippi Canyon; Mississippi Fan; mwp-1a; Sea-level change; Unktehi; Wisconsin glaciation","climate change; deglaciation; glaciation; global warming; ice shelf; jokulhlaup; Laurentia; meltwater; North Atlantic Deep Water; transgression; Wisconsinan; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico",,,,,,"Abascal, A.J., Sheinbaum, J., Candela, J., Ochoa, J., Badan, A., Analysis of flow variability in the Yucatan Channel (2003) Journal of Geophysical Research, 108 (C12), p. 3381. , DOI: 10.1029/2003JC001922; Aharon, P., Entrainment of meltwaters in hyperpycnal flows during deglaciation superflows in the Gulf of Mexico (2006) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 241, pp. 260-270; Alley, R.B., Dupont, T.K., Parizek, B.R., Anandakrishnan, S., Lawson, D.E., Larson, G.J., Evenson, E.B., Outburst flooding and the initiation of ice-stream surges in response to climatic cooling: A hypothesis (2005) Geomorphology, 75, pp. 76-89; Beaney, C.L., Shaw, J., The subglacial geomorphology of southeast Alberta: Evidence for subglacial meltwater erosion (2000) Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 37, pp. 51-61; Blanchon, P., Shaw, J., Reef drowning during the last glaciation: Evidence for catastrophic sea-level rise and ice sheet collapse (1995) Geology, 23, pp. 4-8; Bond, G., Heinrich, H., Broecker, W., Labeyrie, L., McManus, J., Andrews, J., Huon, S., Ivy, S., Evidence for massive discharges of icebergs into the North Atlantic ocean during the last glacial period (1992) Nature, 360, pp. 245-249; Bond, G., Showers, W., Cheseby, M., Lotti, R., Almasi, P., deMenocal, P., Priore, P., Bonani, G., A pervasive millennial-scale cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and glacial climates (1997) Science, 278 (5341), pp. 1257-1266; Bouma, A.H., Stelting, C.E., Coleman, J.M., Mississippi Fan, Gulf of Mexico (1985) Submarine Fans and Related Turbidite Systems, , In: Bouma, A.H., Normark, W.R. and Barnes, N.E., (eds): Springer.
