To alleviate such an adverse effect, there is a need to screen watermelon germplasm collections to identify genetic sources for potential drought tolerance. In the present study, 820 accessions of USDA's Citrullus PIs and 246 watermelon breeding lines were evaluated for their drought tolerance at the seedling stage under extreme water stress conditions in a greenhouse. Significant variations in drought tolerance were observed in the Citrullus germplasm collections. Using fast clustering analysis, the tested watermelon materials could be assigned into four groups, including tolerant, intermediate tolerant, moderately sensitive, and sensitive, respectively. The most drought-tolerant Citrullus germplasm, including 13 Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus and 12 C. lanatus var. citroides accessions, were originated from Africa. These genetic materials could be used for rootstock breeding or for developing drought-tolerant watermelon cultivars.","Breeding; Citrullus lanatus; Plant introduction","Citrullus; Citrullus lanatus; Citrullus lanatus var. citroides; Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus",,,,,,"Akashi, K., Miyake, C., Yokota, A., Citrulline, a novel compatible solute in drought-tolerance wild watermelon leaves, is an efficient hydroxyl radical scavenger (2001) FEBS Lett, 508, pp. 438-442; Akashi, K., Nishimura, N., Ishida, Y., Yokota, A., Potent hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity of drought-induced type-2 metallothionein in wild watermelon (2004) Biochem.
