The non-uniqueness of atmospheric aerosols and the impact of clouds on warming (or cooling) of the atmosphere-underlying surface system need more detailed modelling to elucidate the optical properties of the atmosphere and surface. In multi-angle remote sensing, inverse problem retrieval using radiances over only one pixel presents a fundamental difficulty involving the multiplicity of solutions. In particular, it was found that different analytical approaches for the retrieval of optical parameters give a multiplicity of solutions, even in the simplest case of the slab homogeneous model and the standard scheme of illumination of the clear atmosphere. The phase function was approximated with one parameter functions. Only four parameters of the homogeneous atmosphere are retrieved in our simple variant. The found effect does not link with the low information content of observational data in respect to the desired parameters. It is not a result of the ill-posed inverse problem, insofar as it concerns properties of integral functionals in customary comprehension and calls for strong variations of vertical profiles of parameters. It seems that the effect of solution multiplicity is a direct consequence of radiation field non-linear dependence on atmospheric and surface parameters that leads to closely coinciding radiation fields forming with essentially different combinations of optical parameters. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,"20th century; Analytical approach; Atmospheric parameters; Global climate changes; Homogeneous atmospheres; Homogeneous models; ILL-posed inverse problem; Information contents; Integral functionals; Multi-angle remote sensing; Multiplicity of solutions; Non-linear; Nonuniqueness; Observational data; Optical parameter; Parameter functions; Phase functions; Radiation field; Remote observation; Scientific community; Solution multiplicity; Surface parameter; Underlying surface; Vertical profile; Atmospheric aerosols; Climate change; Inverse problems; Optical variables control; Remote sensing; Optical properties; aerosol; analytical method; atmospheric modeling; climate change; global change; inverse problem; optical property; remote sensing; twentieth century",,,,,,"Alexandris, D., Varotsos, C., Kondratyev, K.Y., Chronopoulos, G., On the altitude dependence of solar effective UV (1999) Physics and Chemistry of the Earth Part C-Solar-Terrestrial and Planetary Science, 24, pp. 515-517. , http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov, Available online at, 2008; http://parasol-polder.cnes.fr/en/index.htm, 2008; http://smsc.cnes.fr/POLDER/, 2008; Box, G., Jenkins, G., (1970) Time Series Analysis Forecasting and Control, p. 406. , (San Francisco: Holden-Day); Cracknell, A.P., Varotsos, C.A., Ozone depletion over Scotland as derived from nimbus-7 TOMS measurements (1994) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 15, pp. 2659-2668; Cracknell, A.P., Varotsos, C.A., The present status of the total ozone depletion over Greece and Scotland-a comparison between Mediterranean and more northerly latitudes (1995) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 16, pp. 1751-1763; Cracknell, A.P., Varotsos, C.A., The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the fiftieth anniversary of Sputnik (2007) Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 14, pp. 384-387; Cracknell, A.P., Varotsos, C.A., Fifty years after the first artificial satellite: From Sputnik 1 to ENVISAT (2007) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 28, pp. 2071-2072; Efstathiou, M., Varotsos, C., Kondratyev, K.Y., An estimation of the surface solar ultraviolet irradiance during an extreme total ozone minimum (1998) Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics, 68, pp. 171-176; Ferm, M., de Santis, F., Varotsos, C., Nitric acid measurements in connection with corrosion studies (2005) Atmospheric Environment, 39, pp. 6664-6672; Ferm, M., Watt, J., O'Hanlon, S., de Santis, F., Varotsos, C., Deposition measurement of particulate matter in connection with corrosion studies (2006) Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 384, pp. 1320-1330; Gernandt, H., Goersdorf, U., Claude, H., Varotsos, C.A., Possible impact of polar stratospheric processes on mid-latitude vertical ozone distributions (1995) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 16, pp. 1839-1850; Katsambas, A., Varotsos, C.A., Veziryianni, G., Antoniou, C., Surface solar ultraviolet radiation: A theoretical approach of the SUVR reaching the ground in Athens, Greece (1997) Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 4, pp. 69-73; Kokhanovsky, A.A., Breon, F.M., Cacciary, A., Carboni, E., Diner, D., Di Nicolantonio, W., Grainger, R.G., von Hoyningen-Huene, W., Aerosol remote sensing over land: A comparison of satellite retrievals using different algorithms and instruments (2007) Atmospheric Research, 85, pp. 372-394; Kondratyev, K.Y., Pokrovsky, O.M., Varotsos, C.A., Atmospheric ozone trends and other factors of surface ultraviolet radiation variability (1995) Environmental Conservation, 22, pp. 259-261; Kondratyev, K.Y., Varotsos, C.A., Global total ozone dynamics-Impact on surface solar ultraviolet radiation variability and ecosystems. 1.
