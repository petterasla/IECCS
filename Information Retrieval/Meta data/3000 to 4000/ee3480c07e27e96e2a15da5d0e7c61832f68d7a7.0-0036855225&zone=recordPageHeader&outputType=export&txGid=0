The Dasuopu accumulation (DSP An) also shows a strong correlation to the Northern Hemispheric temperature. Generally, as the Northern Hemispheric temperature increases by 0.1 K, the accumulation decreases by about 90 mm and vise versa. Under the condition of global warming, especially since 1920, the Northern Hemispheric mean temperature has increased by about 0.5 K, whereas accumulation in Dasuopu ice core has decreased by about 450 mm. According to the relationship between accumulation and temperature, a scenario prediction of monsoon rainfall in central Himalayas is made.","Accumulation; Dasuopu ice core; Global warming","ice; rain; article; China; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; precipitation; seasonal variation",,,,,,"Himalayan glacier backing off (1998) Science, 281 (5381), p. 1277; Orelemans, J., Quantifying global warming from the retreat of glaciers (1994) Science, 264, p. 243; Orelemans, J., Fortuin, J.P.F., Sensitivity of glaciers and small ice caps to greenhouse warming (1992) Science, 258, p. 115; Kotlyakov, V.M., Grosswald, M.G., Dyurgerov, M.B., The reaction of glaciers to impending climate change (1991) Polar Geography and Ecology, 15 (3), p. 203; Yao, T.D., Thompson, L.G., Qin, D.H., Variations in temperature and precipitation in the past 2000 a on Xizang (Tibet) Plateau - Guliya ice core record (1996) Science in China, Ser.
