Geological prospecting of the rich-storage zone of methane is an important precondition for gas recovery projects. Shear zones along coal seams have long been considered as a major place where gas outbursts occur during mining, but they also have a positive aspect in coalbed methane prospecting and production because of their great quantity of fractures and high methane content. Mercury penetrating experiments on a series of variously sheared coal samples from the Pingdingshan coalfield, China, were performed. The results showed that tectonically sheared coals possess three to eight times more porosity and two to ten times more specific surface area than their normal counterparts. Moreover, brittlely deformed coals possess larger average fracture apertures representing a good condition for methane extraction, whereas ductilely deformed coals show a fracture aperture even smaller than normal coals, which can explain why intensely sheared coals become difficult for methane extraction. The occurrence of a large number of tectonic fractures in a shear zone will make it easier for an artificial fracture to increase the permeability of coals in methane production. Therefore, except for locally ductile deformation areas, shear zones along coal seams are the best source and reservoir for methane gas production and, if this methane is extracted, it will help not only the reservoir but also protect the earth against global warming.","Coalbed methane (CBM); Global warming; Mercury penetration; Shear zone","Extraction; Fracture; Geophysical prospecting; Global warming; Methane; Pore size; Coalbed methane; Coal; coal seam; coalbed methane; global warming; porosity; shear; tectonic setting",,,,,,"Beamish, B.B., Crosdale, P.J., Instantaneous outbursts in underground coal mines: An overview and association with coal type (1998) Int J Coal Geol, 35, pp. 27-55; Bibler, C.J., Marshall, J.S., Pilcher, R.C., Status of worldwide coal mine methane emissions and use (1998) Int J Coal Geol, 35, pp. 283-510; Bustin, R.M., The effect of shearing on quality of some coals in the southeastern Canadian Cordillera (1982) Can Inst Min Metall Bull, 75, pp. 76-83; Cao, Y., The knowledge and practice for prediction of gas outburst by gas geology (1994) J China Coal Soc Suppl, 20, pp. 76-78; Dumpleton, S., Outbursts in the South Wales coalfield: Their occurrence in three dimensions and a method for identifying potential outburst zones (1990) Min Eng, 1990, pp. 322-329; Frodsham, K., Gayer, R.A., The impact of tectonic deformation upon coal seams in the South Wales coalfield, UK (1999) Int J Coal Geol, 38, pp. 297-332; (1990) Depositional models of coal-bearing sequences in the Henan Province, , China Geological University Press, Beijing; Hargravs, A.J., Instantaneous outbursts of coal and gas: A review (1983) Proc Aust Inst Min Metall, 285, pp. 1-37; Hokao, Z., (1982) Prediction, method and countermeasure of gas outburst, , Uchida Rokakuho Press, Tokyo; John, R., Greenhouse challenge of Australian coal mining industry (2000) Proc Asia-Pacific workshop on coal mining technology 2000 Symp, pp. 219-230. , Japan Coal Energy Center, Tokyo; Kang, J., Li, W., Remark on the Guodishan fault in Pingdingshan coalfield (1995) J China Coal Soc, 20, pp. 132-141; Li, H., Application of the deformation coefficients of fold in forecasting outburst of coal and gas (1995) Henan Geol, 13, pp. 304-308; Peng, L., The main types of bedding faults and its geological significance (1991) Proc 4th Academic Discussion of Jiaozuo Mining Institute, pp. 26-45. , Jiaozuo, China; Ramsay, J., Huber, M., (1987) The techniques of modern structural geology, vol 2: folds and fractures, 2, pp. 445-502. , Academic Press, London; Rootare, H.M., Prenzlow, C.F., Surface area from mercury porosimeter measurements (1967) J Phys Chem, 71, pp. 2733-2736; Shepherd, J., Rixon, L.K., Griffiths, L., Outbursts and geological structures in coal mines: A review (1981) Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr, 18, pp. 267-283; Spitzer, Z., Mercury porosimetry and its application to the analysis of coal pore structure (1981) Power Technol, 29, pp. 177-186; Toda, Y., (1973) Report of study on pore structure of coals and their carbonized products, pp. 36-46. , National Research Institute for Pollution and Resources no 5, Tsukuba, Japan; Wang, Y., Yang, S., Some characteristics of coal seam with hazard of outburst (1980) J China Coal Soc, 1, pp. 47-53; Washburn, E.W., Note on a method of determining the distribution of pore sizes in a porous material (1921) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 7, pp. 115-116; Yu, L., Li, W., Study on composition of hydrocarbon in coal seams liable to outbursts (1981) J China Coal Soc, 4, pp. 1-8; Zwietering, P., Van Krevelen, D., Chemical structure and properties of coal-pore structure (1954) Fuel, 33, pp. 331-337","Li, H.; Doctoral Program in Geoscience, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305-8571, Japan; email: lhy@arsia.geo.tsukuba.ac.jp",,,,,,,,09430105,,ENGOE,,"English","Environ.
