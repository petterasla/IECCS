IGFC plant amenability to carbon capture for sequestration makes the technology more attractive given the increasing concern over global climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. With the support of the US Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory, the Advanced Power and Energy Program has conducted a study to identify promising conceptual designs for IGFC plants. The most promising IGFC concept identified so far is a system with catalytic hydro-gasification, a pressurized (operating pressure of 10 bar) SOFC followed by a turbo-expander and a steam cycle. The design requirement for recycling de-carbonized anode exhaust back to the gasifier for hydro-gasification not only produces a synergistic integration of SOFC and gasification subsystems, but also makes carbon separation a natural result. The current analyses of this system show an efficiency of 58.4 per cent (coal higher heating value basis) while capturing 94 per cent of the CO2</ sub>. Using this system as a baseline case, this work investigates the sensitivity of IGFC system performance on the extent of carbon capture. It is shown that the proposed IGFC system can achieve ultra-high carbon capture (>99 per cent) at small system efficiency expense while reducing carbon capture to below 90 per cent actually diminishes the system efficiency because less fuel is converted in the SOFC.","carbon di-oxide capture; carbon dioxide sequestration; catalytic hydro-gasification; integrated gasification fuel cell; sensitivity analysis; solid oxide fuel cell","Carbon capture; carbon dioxide sequestration; Carbon separation; catalytic hydro-gasification; Current analysis; Design requirements; Energy programs; Environmentally-friendly; Fuel cell system; Gasifiers; Global climate changes; Higher heating value; integrated gasification fuel cell; National Energy Technology Laboratory; Operating pressure; Small systems; Steam cycles; Synergistic integration; System efficiency; Ultra-high; US Department of Energy; Calorific value; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal gasification plants; Design; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Sensitivity analysis; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Steam engineering; Gasification",,,,,,"(2009) International Energy Outlook 2009, , Energy Information Administration (EIA)., (US Department of Energy, Washington, District of Columbia); Davison, J., Performance and costs of power plants with capture and storage of CO 2 (2007) Energy, 32 (7), pp. 1163-1176. , DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2006.07.039, PII S0360544206002155; Descamps, C., Bouallou, C., Kanniche, M., Efficiency of an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant including CO2 removal (2008) Energy, 33 (6), pp. 874-881. , DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2007.07.013, PII S0360544207001260; Rao, A.D., Francuz, D.J., MacLay, J.D., Brouwer, J., Verma, A., Li, M., Samuelsen, G.S., System analyses of advanced Brayton cycles for high efficiency zero emission plants (2008) Final Report., , DOI: 10.2172/951990; Klara, S.M., Advancing coal energy technologies: Department of energy R&D program (2009) Proceedings of the 10th Annual SECAWorkshop, , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, July; Jansen, D., Van Der Laag, P.C., Oudhuis, A.B.J., Ribberink, J.S., Prospects for advanced coal-fuelled fuel cell power plants (1994) J.
