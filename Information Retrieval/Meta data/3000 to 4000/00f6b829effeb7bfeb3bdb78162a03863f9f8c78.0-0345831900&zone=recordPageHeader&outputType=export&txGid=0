These observations, coupled with an understanding of the effects of temperature on plant phenology, suggest that future changes in the atmosphere and climate could alter plant phenology with unknown or unpredictable consequences. We assessed the effects of simulated climatic warming and atmospheric CO2 enrichment on the spring and autumn phenology of maple trees (Acer rubrum and A. saccharum) growing for four years in open-top field chambers. CO2 enrichment ( + 300 ppm) had no consistent effects on the timing of budbreak and leaf unfolding in the spring or leaf abscission in the autumn. Warming (+ 4 °C) usually had predictable effects: in two of the three years of assessment, budbreak occurred earlier in warm chambers than in ambient temperature chambers, and leaf abscission always occurred later. The lengthening of the growing season could contribute to increased productivity, although effects of temperature on other physiological processes can concurrently have negative effects on productivity. In 1995, budbreak was unexpectedly delayed in the warmer chambers, apparently the result of advanced budbreak leading to injury from a late-spring frost. Likewise, there was increased risk associated with longer leaf retention in the autumn: in 1994, leaves in the warm chambers were killed by freezing temperatures before they had senesced. These observations support the premise that global warming could increase the length of the growing season. Phenological responses should, therefore, be part of any assessment of the possible consequences of global change, but our results also suggest that those responses may not always have positive effects on production.","Acer rubrum; Acer saccharum; Budbreak; Global change; Growing season length; Leaf abscission; Phenology","abscission; budburst; carbon dioxide enrichment; global warming; growing season; leaf; phenology; Acer; Acer rubrum; Acer saccharum; Saccharum; Saccharum hybrid cultivar",,,,,,"Bradley, N.L., Leopold, A.C., Ross, J., Phenological changes reflect climate change in Wisconsin (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 96, pp. 9701-9704. , USA; Burton, P.J., Cumming, S.G., Potential effects of climatic change on western Canadian forests, based on phenological enhancements to a patch model of forest succession (1995) Water, Air and Soil Pollution, 82, pp. 401-414; Campbell, R.K., Sugano, A.I., Genecology of bud-burst phenology in Douglas-fir: Response to flushing temperature and chilling (1979) Botanical Gazette, 140, pp. 223-231; Cannell, M.G.R., Smith, R.I., Climatic warming, spring budburst and frost damage on trees (1986) Journal of Applied Ecology, 23, pp. 177-191; Cheng, L., Fuchigami, L.H., Growth of young apple trees in relation to reserve nitrogen and carbohydrates (2002) Tree Physiology, 22, pp. 1297-1303; Chmielewski, F.M., Rötzer, T., Response of tree phenology to climate change across Europe (2001) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 108, pp. 101-112; Dunlap, J.M., Stettler, R.F., Genetic variation and productivity of Populus trichocarpa and its hybrids X.
