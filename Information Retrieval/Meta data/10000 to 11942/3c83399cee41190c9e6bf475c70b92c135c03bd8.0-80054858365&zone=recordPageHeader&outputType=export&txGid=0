Many policies to encourage investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy have been issued. This article provides insights into the latest development of energy production, energy consumption and energy strategic planning and policies in China, and also describes the analysis, carried out by the authors as part of the Asian Energy Security project using the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) modeling tool, of the impacts of implementing new and expected energy and environmental policies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Energy; LEAP","China; Economic growths; Energy; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy productions; Energy sector; Energy security; Energy supplies; Environmental policy; Expected energy; Latest development; LEAP; Modeling tool; Pollutant emission; Renewable energies; Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Global warming; Energy efficiency; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; energy use; environmental policy; investment; policy implementation; resource development; China",,,,,,"Bai, J., (2009), Presentation at IEA Energy Technology Transition Project Launch Workshop, Beijing, June 2009(2009) Beijing Business Newspaper, , http://www.powerec.net/frontGroundElectNewsViewAction.do?code=13336, New energy industry development planning will not be issued this year, December 1 (in Chinese).
