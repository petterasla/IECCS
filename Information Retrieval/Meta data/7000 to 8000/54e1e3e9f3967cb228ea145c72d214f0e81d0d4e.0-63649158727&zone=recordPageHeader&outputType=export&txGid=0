Moreover, both the frequency of grassland fire and loss from them are considered to be increasing with the global warming and economic development. This study presents a methodology for risk analysis and assessment of grassland fire disaster, taking western Jilin province as a case study area based on geographic information system (GIS). The composite grassland fire disaster risk index (GFDRI) combined the hazard of grassland fire, the exposure of the region, the vulnerability and emergency response and recovery capability for grassland fire disaster of the region were developed to assess and compare risk of grassland fire disaster in different counties in western Jilin province, China using the natural disaster risk index method (NDRIM), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted comprehensive method (WCM). Then, the risk degree of grassland fire disaster was assessed and regionalized in the western Jilin province, China based on GFDRI by using GIS. It is shown that the most places of western Jilin province were in mediate risk. Zhenlai, Tongyu were in heavy risk. Taobei, Ningjiang, Fuyu were in light risk. The information obtained from interviewing the district official committees in relation to result compiled was statistically evaluated. The GFDRI was developed to be an easily understandable tool that can be used to assess and compare the relative risk of grassland fire disaster in different counties in t western Jilin province, China, and to compare the different relative contributions of various factors, e.g., frequency of grassland fire and quality of emergency evacuation plan. The GFDRI is specifically intend to support local and national government agencies of grassland fire disaster management as they (1) make resource allocation decisions; (2) make high-level planning decisions; and (3) raise public awareness of grassland fire disaster risk, its causes, and ways to manage it. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","GIS; Grassland fire disaster; Grassland fire disaster risk; Risk assessment; Western Jilin province","Analytic hierarchies; Comprehensive methods; Disaster managements; Economic development; Emergency evacuations; Emergency response; GIS; Grassland fire disaster; Grassland fire disaster risk; National governments; Natural disaster risks; Public awareness; Relative contributions; Relative risks; Resource allocation decisions; Risk degrees; Risk indices; Study areas; Western Jilin province; Accidents; Agriculture; Analytic hierarchy process; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Economics; Fires; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Hierarchical systems; Planning; Resource allocation; Risk analysis; Risk management; Safety factor; Risk assessment; conference proceeding; decision analysis; disaster management; fire management; GIS; grassland; index method; natural disaster; planning method; risk assessment; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jilin",,,,,,"Bilgili, E., Saglam, B., Fire behavior in Maquis fuels in Turkey (2003) For Ecol Manage, 184 (1-3), pp. 201-207; Castro, F.X., Tudela, A., Sebastià, M.T., Modeling moisture content in shrubs to predict fire risk in Catalonia (Spain) (2003) Agric For Meteorol, 116, pp. 49-59; Cheikh, M., Kalifa, G., BGoze, B., Spectral indices and fire behavior simulation for fire risk assessment in savanna ecosystems (2004) Remote Sens Environ, 91, pp. 1-13; Fu, Z., Research on fire-risk climate zoning and fire management measures on grasslands in inner Mongolia (2001) J Catastrophol, 16 (3), pp. 19-22. , (in Chinese); Guo, P., Sun, G., Zhou, D., Study on grassland fire behavior (2002) Chin J Appl Ecol, 12 (5), pp. 46-74. , (in Chinese); Liu, X.-P., Zhang, X.-Q., Historical data-based risk assessment of grassland fire of grassland in northern China (2007) J Nat Disasters, 16 (1), pp. 61-66. , (in Chinese); Mark, A.F., The challenge of quantitative risk analysis for wildland fire (2005) For Ecol Manage, 211, pp. 97-108; Rachel, A.D., Kelly, B.L., Comparing the hurricane disaster risk of US coastal counties (2001) Nat Hazard Rev, 2 (3), pp. 132-142; Saaty, T.L., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Zhang, J., Damage evaluation of agro-meteorological hazards in the maize-growing region of Songliao plain, China: Case study of Lishu county of Jilin province (2004) Nat Hazards, 31, pp. 209-232. , (in Chinese); Zhang, J.Q., Okada, N., Hirokazu, T., Integrated natural disaster risk management: Comprehensive and integrated model and Chinese strategy choice (2005) Proceedings of Fifth Annual IIASA-DPRI Forum on Integrated Natural Disaster Risk Management, pp. 115-125. , In:; Zhang, J., Zhou, D.W., Wu, X., A new perception on risk assessment and risk management of grassland fire disaster (2006) J Basic Sci Eng, 14 (SUPPL.), pp. 56-62; Zhang, J., Okada, N., Tatano, H., Integrated natural disaster risk management: Comprehensive and integrated model and Chinese strategy choice (2006) J Nat Disaster, 15 (1), pp. 76-79. , (in Chinese); Zhou, D.W., Zhang, Z.S., Grassland inflammation, fire behavior, and fire climate (1996) J Grassland of China, 3, pp. 74-77; Zhou, W.Q., Wang, S.X., Zhou, Y., Research on prediction of grassland fire danger rating (2004) J Nat Disasters, 13 (2), pp. 75-79. , (in Chinese)","Jiquan, Z.; Institute of Natural Disaster Research, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin 130024, China; email: zhangjq022@nenu.edu.cn",,,,,,,,14363240,,,,"English","Stoch.
