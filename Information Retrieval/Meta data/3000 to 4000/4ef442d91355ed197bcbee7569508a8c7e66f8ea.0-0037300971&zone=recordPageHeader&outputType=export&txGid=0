The purpose is to demonstrate the use of SEA in relation to sludge management and to improve SEA methodology. Six different scenarios for management of sewage sludge within the Aalborg municipality involving thermal treatment, composting and landfilling of sludge were evaluated. Environmental impact categories considered were global warming, non-renewable resources (nutrients and fossil fuels) and land use. Impact categories human health, ecotoxicity and soil quality were excluded as methodology for their assessment is not yet fully developed. Thermal sludge treatment with energy utilisation was shown to be a promising option for sewage sludge management in Aalborg. Sensitivity of the relative environmental impacts with respect to calculation methodology and input parameter values were evaluated to identify important parameters and calculation methods. The analysis showed that aggregation procedures, sludge bio-gas potential and sludge production were very important whereas sludge transport was not.","Aggregation methodology; Land use; Non-renewable resources; Sensitivity analysis; Sewage sludge management; Strategic environmental assessment; wmr 606-3","Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Heat treatment; Land use; Sewage sludge; Soils; Strategic environmental assessment (SEA); Waste management; biogas; fossil fuel; composting; environmental impact; landfill; sewage disposal; sewage treatment; composting; environmental assessment; landfill; sewage disposal; sewage treatment; waste management; article; calculation; composting; data analysis; Denmark; ecotoxicity; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; environmental planning; greenhouse effect; health; heat treatment; land use; landfill; methodology; priority journal; recycling; sensitivity analysis; sludge treatment; soil quality; Cities; Environment; Forecasting; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Sewage; Soil Pollutants; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Denmark",,"Sewage; Soil Pollutants",,,,"Barton, J.R., Dalley, D., Patel, V.S., Life cycle assessment for waste management (1996) Waste Management, 16, pp. 35-50; Burgess, A.A., Brennan, D.J., Application of life cycle assessment to chemical processes (2001) Chemical Engineering Science, 56, pp. 2589-2604; (2002), BP Statistical review of world energy (June) BP Distribution Services, Bournemouth, EnglandDavis, R.D., Planning the best strategy for sludge treatment and disposal operations (1994) Wat.
