In a 4-month laboratory experiment, effects of the epigeic earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra on a succession of nematode community in litter of a mid-European birch/oak forest were tested in the gradient of an increase of diurnal temperature fluctuations from 0° C (constant 15° C; T 15) to 10° C (daily range between 10° and 20° C; T 10-20) and 20° C (daily range between 5° and 25° C; T 5-25). Earthworm and temperature effects were measured as differences in nematode community respiration rates between the experimental treatments. Nematode respiration rates were calculated on the basis of body size/weight/O 2 consumption relationships for individual species. Nematode community was dominated by bacterial feeders and changed in a characteristic successional pattern which, however, was markedly modified by temperature regime and earthworm activities. Dominant nematode taxa revealed specific patterns of temporal dynamics in connection with their responses to temperature and earthworm presence. Thus, metabolic activity of Plectus acuminatus was strongly reduced by D, octaedra but did not react to variation of temperature regime. In contrast, activity of Panagrolaimus sp. significantly responded to temperature but not to earthworm presence, whereas Pl. thornei reacted to both factors separately and in combination. Ceratoplectus armatus was stronger affected by earthworm presence then by temperature; Tylocephalus auriculatus showed the opposite pattern. The variety of responses may explain the coexistence of several taxonomically related (Plectidae) and trophically similar species within the dominant group. Both earthworm presence and increase of the range of diurnal temperature fluctuations strongly affected the net of interspecific correlations within the nematode community. Earthworms strongly reduced total activities of nematode community at any temperature regime. T 15 regime showed markedly lower level of cumulative nematode respiration than both fluctuating regimes, irrespective of earthworm presence. In conclusion, combined effects of earthworms and temperature regime drastically changed patterns of relationships within the nematode litter community. The results of the experiments may have implications for the perspectives of global warming events at the study site: it is suggested that the ultimate vector of the changes in litter environment might be directed towards the conditions of the treatment [T 15 regime; earthworms present], with the corresponding trends in the development of the litter nematode community.","Community succession; Earthworms; Global change; Nematodes; Temperature regime","body size; deciduous forest; diurnal variation; earthworm; global warming; metabolism; soil ecosystem; soil respiration; succession; taxonomy; temperature effect; Europe; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ceratoplectus armatus; Dendrobaena octaedra; Nematoda; Panagrolaimus sp.; Plectidae; Plectus acuminatus; Tylocephalus auriculatus",,,,,,"Anderson, G.L., Responses of dauerlarvae of Caenorhabditis elegans (Nematoda: Rhabditidae) to thermal stress and oxygen deprivation (1978) Can.
