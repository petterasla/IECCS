Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand","A water-balance model was developed for a tidal lake-wetland complex to: (1) determine the relative contribution of hydrological flows through the lake-wetland complex; (2) determine the tidal and non-tidal hydraulic residence times of two lakes in the lake-wetland complex; and (3) estimate the potential importance of groundwater inputs to the lake-wetland complex. All surface hydrological inputs to the system were either measured or estimated over 1 year. Daily evaporation from the water bodies was also estimated. Discharge at the outflow of the lake-wetland complex was monitored to calculate the net daily outflow. A correction procedure was used to remove the error resulting from aliasing of the daily calculation period and the tidal period. The difference between the measured net outflow and that calculated by the water-balance model indicated that a large amount of net discharge from the lake-wetland complex may have been a result of previously unrecognised groundwater inputs to the system. The non-tidal hydraulic residence times of the two lakes differed markedly as did the relative importance of tidal inflows. The influence of variation in tidal and non-tidal hydraulic residence time on limnological processes is discussed, particularly with respect to impacts of global climate change on tidal lake ecosystems.","Estuary; Groundwater; Hydrology; Lagoon; Lake; Lake waihola; Lake waipori; Tidal; Water balance","lake ecosystem; residence time; water budget; water flow; wetland; New Zealand",,,,,,"Bond, L.D., Bredehoeft, J.D., Origins of seawater intrusion in a coastal aquifer - A case study of the Pajaro Valley, California (1987) Journal of Hydrology, 92, pp. 363-388; Diamonds, J.B., Petalas, C.P., Seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers of Thrace and its impact on the environment (1987) Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry, 20-21, pp. 291-305; Dickinson, W., Shulmeister, J., Holme, P., Rower, J., Carter, J., Prebble, M., Augustinus, P., Graphical logs, radiometric dates, photographs, and background information for Lake Waipori Core 99-1, Taieri Plain, New Zealand (2000) Research Report No. 5, 5. , Wellington, New Zealand, Victoria University of Wellington School of Earth Sciences; Finkelstein, J., Survey of New Zealand tank evaporation (1973) Journal of Hydrology (N.Z.), 12, pp. 119-131; Giblin, A.E., Gaines, A.G., Nitrogen inputs to a marine embayment: The importance of groundwater (1990) Biogeochemistry, 10, pp. 309-328; Grindley, J.R., Estuarine plankton (1981) Estuarine Ecology with Particular Reference to Southern Africa, p. 117. , Day, J.
