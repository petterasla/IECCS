The carbon stock changes were estimated based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and combined with the life cycle GHG emissions from palm oil and biodiesel production in Thailand. For 1 million liters of biodiesel production per day, the Krabi, Chonburi and Pathumthani cases resulted in -709 Mg CO2-eq/day, -748 Mg CO2-eq/day and -600 Mg CO2-eq/day, respectively. The Pathumthani case showed the lowest negative GHG balance even with least fertilization partly because of larger transportation distances while the Chonburi case was the highest despite low yield as it would require more land to grow oil palm for the same amount of biodiesel, resulting in more soil carbon being sequestered. However, the land use change scenarios chosen for this study all show a negative GHG balance which means that biodiesel helps reduce GHG in the atmosphere. © 2010 International Energy Initiative.","Biodiesel; Global warming; Greenhouse gas; Land-use change; Oil palm","biofuel; biogas; gas production; global warming; greenhouse gas; land use change; Central Region [Thailand]; Pathum Thani; Thailand; Elaeis; Manihot esculenta",,,,,,"Akesamatramate, T., Nilnon, C., Chantraniyom, T., Thongkam, P., See-Sanong, S., The road of success in oil palm industry (2005) Oil Palm Research and Development Center, , Prince of Songkla University, In Thai; (1996) Ökoinventare für Verpackungen, Schriftenreihe Umwelt 250, , BUWAL, Bern, Switzerland; (2006) Project Design Document Form (CDM-PDD), , CDM Executive Board, Vichitphan Palm Oil Company, Chumporn, Thailand; Cherubini, F., Jungmeier, G., LCA of a biorefinery concept producing bioethanol, bioenergy, and chemicals from switchgrass (2010) Int J Life Cycle Ass., 15 (1), pp. 53-66; Chisti, Y., Biodiesel from microalgae (2007) Biotechnology Advances, 25 (3), pp. 294-306; (2009), http://www.cpcrop.com/tabid/233/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/544/----48-.aspx, Crop Integration Business C.P.
