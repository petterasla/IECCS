In this study, we proposed a generic power-law relationship between global warming and the usable wind energy (Betz's law). The power law index (∼4, region dependent) is then determined using simulated atmospheric parameters from eight global coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models (CGCMs). It is found that the power-law relationship holds across all eight climate models and also is time scale independent. Reduction of wind power scales with the degree of warming according to a generic power-law relationship. Thus, the earlier we switch to clean energy, and thereby decrease the global climate warming trend, the more cost-effective will be the harnessing of wind energy. This relationship is an area-averaged consequence of the reduced poleward temperature gradient as the climate warms during the 21st Century; it does not imply spatial uniformity over a region of interest. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.",,"Atmospheric parameters; Clean energy; Climate warms; Global climate warming; Ocean-atmosphere; Power law index; Power-law relationship; Region of interest; Spatial uniformity; Temperature gradient; Time-scales; Wind energy; Air pollution; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Wind power; Climate models",,,,,,"McElroy, M., Lu, X., Nielson, C., Wang, Y., (2009) Science, 325, p. 1378. , 0036-8075, 10.1126/science.1175706; Karl, T.R., Trenberth, K.E., Modern Global Climate Change (2003) Science, 302 (5651), pp. 1719-1723. , DOI 10.1126/science.1090228; Groisman, P., Knight, R., Karl, T., Easterling, D., Sun, B., Lawrimore, J., (2004) J.
