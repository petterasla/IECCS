The model has a horizontal resolution of 4° × 5°, but the runoff from each model grid box is quartered and added to the appropriate river drainage basin on a 2° × 2.5° resolution. The computed runoff depends on the model's precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture storage. For the doubled CO2 climate, the runoff increased for 25 of the 33 rivers, and in most cases the increases coincided with increased rainfall within the drainage basins. There were runoff increases in all rivers in high northern latitudes, with a maximum increase of 47%. At low latitudes there were both increases and decreases ranging from a 96% increase to a 43% decrease. -from Authors",,"climate change; evapotranspiration; global warming; precipitation; river runoff; soil moisture storage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026464719
