Thermal power plants also account for 39% of all freshwater withdrawals in the U.S. To reduce GHG emissions from coal-fired plants, postcombustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems are receiving considerable attention. Current commercial amine-based capture systems require water for cooling and other operations that add to power plant water requirements. This paper characterizes and quantifies water use at coalburning power plants with and without CCS and investigates key parameters that influence water consumption. Analytical models are presented to quantify water use for major unit operations. Case study results show that, for power plants with conventional wet cooling towers, approximately 80% of total plant water withdrawals and 86% of plant water consumption is for cooling. The addition of an amine-based CCS system would approximately double the consumptive water use of the plant. Replacing wet towers with air-cooled condensers for dry cooling would reduce plant water use by about 80% (without CCS) to about 40% (with CCS). However, the cooling system capital cost would approximately triple, although costs are highly dependent on site-specific characteristics. The potential for water use reductions with CCS is explored via sensitivity analyses of plant efficiency and other key design parameters that affect water resource management for the electric power industry. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Air-cooled condensers; Analytical model; Capture system; Carbon capture and storage; Coal fired plants; Coal-burning power plants; Coal-fired power plant; Dry cooling; Electric power industries; Electricity supply; GHG emission; Global climate changes; Key design parameters; Key parameters; Plant efficiency; Plant water; Post-combustion; Pulverized coal power plant; Site-specific; System capital costs; Thermal power plants; Unit operation; Water consumption; Water use; Waterresource management; Wet cooling tower; Associated gas; Coal; Coal storage; Cooling systems; Electric industry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Mathematical models; Organic compounds; Sensitivity analysis; Thermoelectric power plants; Towers; Water management; Water supply; Fossil fuel power plants; coal; water; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; coal-fired power plant; electricity supply; greenhouse gas; sensitivity analysis; water management; water resource; water use; analytic method; article; carbon storage; combustion; cost; electric power plant; environmental parameters; sensitivity analysis; Air Pollution; Carbon Sequestration; Coal; Conservation of Natural Resources; Power Plants; Water Supply; United States",,"water, 7732-18-5; Coal",,,,"(2009), U.S. Department of Energy Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting's Energy Information Administration.
