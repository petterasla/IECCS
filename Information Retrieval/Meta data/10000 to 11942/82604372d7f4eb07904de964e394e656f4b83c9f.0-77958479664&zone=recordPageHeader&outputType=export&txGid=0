We investigated the thermosensitive period of the Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) using laboratory switching experiments, where incubation temperatures above 22° C produce male hatchlings. Sex is determined by 28% of the full incubation period at 23° C, the male-producing temperature (week 7 of an average 21 week incubation period), and 39% of the full incubation period at 20° C, the female-producing temperature (week 11 of an average 31 week incubation period). The thermosensitive period for the tuatara corresponds broadly to that of other reptiles, at the beginning of the middle third of development, although clearly temperatures prior to this period may also influence sex determination. Refining knowledge of the timing of the thermosensitive period is invaluable for interpreting the effects of nest temperatures on sex determination of hatchling tuatara, as well as predicting sex ratios under climate change scenarios.","Reptile; Sphenodon; Temperature-dependent sex determination; Thermosensitive period; TSD; Tuatara","Reptilia; Sphenodon; Sphenodon punctatus",,,,,,"Andrews, R.M., Patterns of embryonic development (2004) Reptilian Incubation: Environment, Evolution and Behaviour, pp. 75-102. , Deeming, D.C.
