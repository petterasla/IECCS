Our previous studies showed that the Fukui population had a predominantly bivoltine life cycle, but recently the life cycle has changed. In the present study, the life-history traits of individuals collected in 2002 in Fukui were clarified and compared to those in the previous studies. The lower threshold temperature for development and the thermal constant for one generation were 10.6°C and 724.4 degree days, respectively. Although these developmental parameters were not investigated in the previous studies, the difference of the developmental period between the present and previous results was negligible in the larval and pupal stages at 20°C. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction was 14 h 29 min at 20°C and 14 h 10 min at 25°C. The critical photoperiod at 25°C was shortened to 14 min from that of the previous studies for individuals collected in 1995. The incidence of pupal diapause in the second generation was investigated in individuals that were collected as fourth and fifth instars in the field. Some portion of individuals averted diapause even if they were kept under a short photoperiod of L14:D10 at 25°C after collection. These results, together with climate data and field observations in Fukui, suggest that at least a part of the population has three generations per year at present. This shift of the life cycle occurred within 7 years and is probably related to global warming in recent years. © 2007 The Authors.","Arctiidae; Critical photoperiod; Developmental rate; Diapause; Hyphantria cunea; Lepidoptera; Photoperiodic response","biological development; climate change; diapause; global warming; life cycle; life history trait; moth; photoperiod; Arctiidae; Hyphantria cunea; Lepidoptera",,,,,,"Bradshaw, W.E., Holzapfel, C.M., Genetic shift in photoperiodic response correlated with global warming (2001) Proceedings of the National Academic Society of USA, 98, pp. 14509-14511; Gomi, T., Effect of temperature on diapause response to photoperiod in Hyphantria cunea with special reference to local divergence (1995) Applied Entomology and Zoology, 30, pp. 490-492; Gomi, T., Mixed life cycles in the transitional zone between voltinisms in the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (1996) Experientia, 52, pp. 273-276; Gomi, T., A mechanism for the decrease in developmental period of a trivoltine population of Hyphantria cunea (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) (1996) Applied Entomology and Zoology, 31, pp. 217-223; Gomi, T., Geographic variation in critical photoperiod for diapause induction and its temperature dependence in Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) (1997) Oecologia, 111, pp. 160-165; Gomi, T., Effects of timing of diapause induction on winter survival and reproductive success in Hyphantria cunea in a transition area of voltinism (2000) Entomological Science, 3, pp. 433-438; Gomi, T., Seasonal adaptations of the fall webworm Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) following its invasion of Japan (2007) Ecological Research, , doi:; Gomi, T., Inudo, M., Yamada, D., Local divergence in developmental traits within a trivoltine area of Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) (2003) Entomological Science, 6, pp. 71-75; Gomi, T., Muraji, M., Takeda, M., Mitochondrial DNA analysis of the introduced fall webworm, showing its shift in life cycle in Japan (2004) Entomological Science, 7, pp. 183-188; Gomi, T., Takeda, M., The transition to a trivoltine life cycle and mechanisms that enforce the voltinism change in Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) in Kobe (1990) Applied Entomology and Zoology, 25, pp. 483-489; Gomi, T., Takeda, M., Geographic variation in photoperiodic responses in an introduced insect, Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) in Japan (1991) Applied Entomology and Zoology, 26, pp. 357-363; Gomi, T., Takeda, M., Changes in life-history traits in the fall webworm within half a century after introduction to Japan (1996) Functional Ecology, 10, pp. 384-389; Harada, T., Nitta, S., Ito, K., Photoperiodic changes according to global warming in wing-form determination and diapause induction of a water strider, Aquarius paludum (Heteroptera: Gerridae) (2005) Applied Entomology and Zoology, 40, pp. 461-466; Hill, J.K., Thomas, C.D., Huntley, B., (2001) Climate and Recent Range Changes in Butterflies.
