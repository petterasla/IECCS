These could be a response to global warming, or part of the natural variability of the climate system. Here, we find ""Great Salinity Anomalies"" in the HadCM3 coupled climate simulation of pre-industrial climate, suggesting they are not a response to recent climatic change. In concurrence with observed events, the HadCM3 simulation produces events which originate in both the Greenland and Labrador Seas.
