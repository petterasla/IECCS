A variety of canola (Brassica napus) has been genetically modified to enhance nitrogen use efficiency, effectively reducing the amount of fertilizer required for crop production. A partial life-cycle assessment adapted to crop production was used to assess the potential environmental impacts of growing genetically modified, nitrogen use-efficient (GMNUE) canola in North Dakota and Minnesota compared with a conventionally bred control variety. The analysis took into account the entire production system used to produce 1 tonne of canola. This comprised raw material extraction, processing and transportation, as well as all agricultural field operations. All emissions associated with the production of 1 tonne of canola were listed, aggregated and weighted in order to calculate the level of environmental impact. The findings show that there are a range of potential environmental benefits associated with growing GMNUE canola. These include reduced impacts on global warming, freshwater ecotoxicity, eutrophication and acidification. Given the large areas of canola grown in North America and, in particular, Canada, as well as the wide acceptance of genetically modified varieties in this area, there is the potential for GMNUE canola to reduce pollution from agriculture, with the largest reductions predicted to be in greenhouse gases and diffuse water pollution. © 2008 The Authors.","Canola; Environmental effects; Fertilizer; Genetic modification; Life-cycle assessment; Nitrogen","fertilizer; nitrogen; article; biological model; environment; environmental protection; eutrophication; evaluation; genetically modified food; genetics; greenhouse effect; metabolism; pollution; rapeseed; transgenic plant; United States; Brassica napus; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Environmental Pollution; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Food, Genetically Modified; Greenhouse Effect; Minnesota; Models, Biological; Nitrogen; North Dakota; Plants, Genetically Modified; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Fertilizers; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Addiscott, T.M., Whitmore, A.P., Powlson, D.S., (1991) Farming, Fertilizers and the Nitrate Problem., , Wallingford: Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau (CAB) Press; (2006), http://www.arcadiabio.com/nutrient.html, Arcadia (.
