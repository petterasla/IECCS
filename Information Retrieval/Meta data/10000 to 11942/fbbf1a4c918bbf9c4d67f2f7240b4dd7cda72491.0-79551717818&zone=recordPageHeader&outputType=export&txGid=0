In the NE Atlantic, abundant evidence from the partly enclosed waters of the North Sea indicates that recent climate-induced changes in primary and secondary productivity have been propagated up the food chain, with marked consequences for higher vertebrate predators such as seabirds. In contrast, however, there is much less indication of such impacts on higher predators in the more open Atlantic waters around the west coast of the British Isles. Through an annual comparison of chick growth and adult food provisioning behaviour of Manx shearwaters in SW Wales, we found that birds bred later and chicks attained lower peak and fledging masses in 2007 and 2008 than in any previous recorded year dating back to 1965. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in parental attendance at the colony, which was probably the result of parents switching to a dual foraging strategy in 2007 and 2008. These events were linked to higher sea surface temperature in the preceding winter and to a reduction in prey quality, as indicated by the mean body mass of 2 yr old herring. These are the first such findings for the west coast of Britain and indicate that within the NE Atlantic region, adverse impacts of climate change on higher marine predators are no longer restricted to the vicinity of the North Sea. © Inter-Research 2011.","Breeding success; Foraging behaviour; Global warming; Manx shearwater; Phenology; Sea surface temperature","anthropogenic effect; body mass; climate change; environmental disturbance; fledging; food chain; food provisioning; foraging behavior; growth rate; marine ecosystem; phenology; primary production; reproductive success; sea surface temperature; seabird; secondary production; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); North Sea; United Kingdom; Aves; Clupeidae; Puffinus puffinus; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Aebischer, N.J., Coulson, J.C., Colebrook, J.M., Parallel long-term trends across four marine trophic levels and weather (1990) Nature, 347 (6295), pp. 753-755; Ainley, D.G., Blight, L.K., Ecological repercussions of historical fish extraction from the southern ocean (2009) Fish Fish, 10, pp. 13-38; Axenrot, T., Hansson, S., Predicting herring recruitment from young-of-the-year densities, spawning stock biomass, and climate (2003) Limnology and Oceanography, 48 (4), pp. 1716-1720; Baum, J.K., Worm, B., Cascading top-down effects of changing oceanic predator abundances (2009) J Anim Ecol, 78, pp. 699-714; Beaugrand, G., The North Sea regime shift: Evidence, causes, mechanisms and consequences (2004) Progress in Oceanography, 60 (2-4), pp. 245-262. , DOI 10.1016/j.pocean.2004.02.018, PII S0079661104000308; Beaugrand, G., Reid, P.C., Ibanez, F., Lindley, J.A., Edwards, M., Reorganization of North Atlantic marine copepod biodiversity and climate (2002) Science, 296 (5573), pp. 1692-1694. , DOI 10.1126/science.1071329; Behrenfeld, M.J., Falkowski, P.G., Photosynthetic rates derived from satellite-based chlorophyll concentration (1997) Limnology and Oceanography, 42 (1), pp. 1-20; Behrenfeld, M.J., O'Malley, R.T., Siegel, D.A., McClain, C.R., Sarmiento, J.L., Feldman, G.C., Milligan, A.J., Boss, E.S., Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity (2006) Nature, 444 (7120), pp. 752-755. , DOI 10.1038/nature05317, PII NATURE05317; Borges, M.F., Santos, A.M.P., Crato, N., Mendes, H., Mota, B., Sardine regime shifts off Portugal: A time series analysis of catches and wind conditions (2003) Scientia Marina, 67 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 235-244. , Fish stock assessments and predictions: Integrating relevant knowledge; Brander, K.M., Global fish production and climate change (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 19709-19714; Brooke, M., De, L., Seasonal, parental, and genetic influences on the chick's age and weight at fledging (1986) Condor, 88, pp. 324-327; Brooke, M., De, L., The Manx shearwater (1990) T. & A.D.
