With the fear of ever-increasing global warming, the UK is one of the key players to participate actively in taking measures to slow down at least its phenomenal rate. As an ingredient to this process, the Springer vehicle has been designed and is being developed for environmental monitoring and pollutant tracking. This paper highlights the Springer hardware and software architecture including various navigational sensors, a speed controller, and an environmental monitoring unit. In addition, details regarding the modelling of the vessel are outlined which are based mainly on recent trials data. The formulation of a fault tolerant multi-sensor data fusion technique is also presented. Moreover, control strategy based on a linear quadratic Gaussian controller is developed and simulated on the Springer model. © IMechE 2008.","Guidance and control; Linear quadratic gaussian; Multi-sensor data fusion; Navigation; Pollutant tracking; Unmanned surface vehicle","Arsenic compounds; Data fusion; Detectors; Environmental engineering; Environmental protection; Global warming; Navigation; Process engineering; Sensors; Software architecture; Vehicles; Controllers; Data fusion; Environmental engineering; Global warming; Navigation; Pollution; Vehicles; Control strategies; Environmental monitoring; Fault-tolerant; Hardware and software; Linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers; Multi sensor data fusion; Navigational sensors; Speed controllers; Unmanned surface vehicle (USV); Sensor data fusion; Sensor data fusion; Environmental Monitoring; Guidance and control; Hardware and software architectures; Linear quadratic Gaussian; Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers; Multisensor data fusion; Navigational sensors; Unmanned surface vehicles",,,,,,"Naeem, W., Xu, T., Chudley, J., Sutton, R., Design of an unmanned surface vehicle for environmental monitoring (2006) Proceedings of the World Maritime Technology Conference, , London, UK, March; Corfield, S.J., Unmanned surface vehicles and other things (2002) Proceedings of the Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Showcase 2002 Conference, pp. 83-91. , Southampton, UK; Young, H.W., Phillips, S.J., Development of an autonomous semi-submersible for deploying sensors for ocean survey (2000) Proceedings of the International UUV Symposium, , Newport, Rhode Island, USA; Reed, C.M., Bishop, B.E., Waters, J.K., Design of an autonomous surface vessel (2006) Proceedings of the World Maritime Technology Conference, , London, UK, March; Hook, D.J., Development of unmanned surface vehicles (2006) Proceedings of the World Maritime Technology Conference, , London, UK, March; Naeem, W., Xu, T., Sutton, R., and Chudley, J.
