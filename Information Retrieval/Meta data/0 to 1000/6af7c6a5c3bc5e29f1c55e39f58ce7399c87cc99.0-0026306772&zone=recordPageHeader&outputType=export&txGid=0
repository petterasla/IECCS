Although precipitation increases are projected by some models, in most cases they do not compensate for increases in potential evaporation. Thus, soil moisture and water availability may decrease over much of Mexico with serious consequences for rainfed and irrigated agriculture, urban and industrial water supplies, hydropower and ecosystems. However, the assessment of global warming impacts in Mexico is an uncertain task because the projections of different models vary widely, particularly for precipitation, and because they perform poorly in reproducing the observed climate of Mexico. © 1991.",,"climate change; climate model; climatic change; global warming; glocal warming; water availability; Mexico",,,,,,"Liverman, Vulnerability to drought in Mexico: The cases of Sonora and Puebla in 1970 (1990) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 80 (1), pp. 49-72; Sanderson, (1986) The Transformation of Mexican Agriculture: International Structure and the Politics of Rural Change, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; World Resources Institute, (1990) World Resources 1990–1991, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Gleick, The effects of future climatic changes on international water resources: The Colorado River, the United States and Mexico (1988) Policy Sciences, 21, pp. 23-39; Liverman, Seguridad y medio ambiente en Mexico (1990) En Busca de la Seguridad Perdida: Aproximaciones a la Seguridad Nacional Mexicana, , S.Aguayo Quezada, B.
