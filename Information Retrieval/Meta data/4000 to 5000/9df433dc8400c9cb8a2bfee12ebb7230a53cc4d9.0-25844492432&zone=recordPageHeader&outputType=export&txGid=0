Tillage intensity may also impact nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which can have various environmental and agronomic impacts. In 2003 and 2004, we used chambers to measure N 2O, CH4, and NO Buses from plots that had been managed under differing tillage intensity since 1991. The effect of tillage on non-CO2 GHG emissions varied, in both magnitude and direction, depending on fertilizer practices. Emissions of N2O following broadcast urea (BU) application were higher under no till (NT) and conservation tillage (CsT) compared to conventional tillage (CT). In contrast, following anhydrous ammonia (AA) injection, N2O emissions were higher under CT and CsT compared to NT. Emissions following surface urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) application did not vary with tillage. Total growing season non-CO2 GHG emissions were equivalent to CO2 emissions of 0.15 to 1.9 Mg CO2 ha-1 yr-1 or 0.04 to 0.53 Mg soil-C ha -1 yr-1. Emissions of N2O from AA-amended plots were two to four times greater than UAN- and BU-amended plots. Total NO + N2O losses in the UAN treatment were approximately 50% lower than AA and BU. This study demonstrates that N2O emissions can represent a substantial component of the total GHG budget of reduced tillage systems, and that interactions between fertilizer and tillage practices can be important in controlling non-CO2 GHG emissions. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Agronomy; Ammonium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Urea; Anhydrous ammonia (AA); Broadcast urea (BU); Conventional tillage (CT); Nitrogen oxides; ammonia; ammonium nitrate; fertilizer; methane; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; urea; agronomic trait; air pollution control; article; conservation tillage; conventional tillage; fertilizer application; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; intermethod comparison; no tillage; nonhuman; surface property; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Analysis of Variance; Chromatography, Gas; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Minnesota; Nitric Oxide; Nitrous Oxide; Time Factors; Urea; Agronomy; Ammonium Compounds; Carbon Dioxide; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Nitrogen Oxides; Urea",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; ammonium nitrate, 6484-52-2; methane, 74-82-8; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; urea, 57-13-6; Air Pollutants; Ammonia, 7664-41-7; Fertilizers; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitric Oxide, 10102-43-9; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Urea, 57-13-6",,,,"Albritton, D., Derwent, R., Isaksen, I., Lal, M., Wuebbles, D., Trace gas radiative forcing indices (1995) Climate Change 1994: Radiative Forcing of Climate Change and An Evaluation of the IPCC IS92 Emission Scenarios, pp. 205-231. , J.
