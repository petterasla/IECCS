Tibet is located in a unique geographical zone with the characteristics of middle-low latitude, high altitude and very low average air temperature, and the climate there has been changed both in time and in space under the effect of global warming. Except for two regions without data, the changes of both air temperature and rainfall in the last 35 years in Tibet exhibit evident zonational patterns. In general, air temperature increases higher from east to west, whereas rainfall changes from decrease to increase from south to north. Except for some areas in southern Tibet, the general increase of rainfall accelerated the rate of water cycle, and caused an increase in the gross amount of water resources in Tibet. Moreover, under the impact of climate change, the frequency of occurrence of landslide and debris flow has slightly increased in the high mountain-canyon regions of eastern Tibet. Also, the debris flow due to ice lake outburst has evidently increased in the plateau mountain-lake basin regions of southern Tibet. By contrast, desertification in the western plateau-lake basin regions of northern Tibet has been intensified. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Air temperature; Climate change; Geo-environment; Rainfall; Tibet plateau; Water resource","Ecosystems; Landslides; Rain; Temperature measurement; Water resources; Air temperature; Geoenvironment; Tibet plateau; Water cycle; Global warming; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; debris flow; global warming; ice lake; rainfall; spatial variation; temporal variation; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xizang",,,,,,"Arnell, N.W., Relative effects of multi-decadal climatic variability and changes in the mean and variability of climate due to global warming: Future streamflows in Britain (2003) J Hydrol, 270, pp. 195-213; Arnell, N.W., Reynard, N.S., The effects of climate change due to global warming on river flows in Great Britain (1996) J Hydrol, 183, pp. 397-424; Gong, D., Wang, S., 1998: The warmest year on record of the century in China (1999) Meteorology, 25, pp. 3-5. , 8.
