Both psychological and sociological factors affect the willingness of laypeople to acknowledge the reality of global warming, and to support climate policies of their home countries. In this paper, I analyse a cross-national dataset of public concern about global warming, utilising data from 46 countries. Based on earlier results at the national and regional level, I expect concern to be negatively correlated to national measures of wealth and carbon dioxide emissions. I find that gross domestic product is indeed negatively correlated to the proportion of a population that regards global warming as a serious problem. There is also a marginally significant tendency that nations' per capita carbon dioxide emissions are negatively correlated to public concern. These findings suggest that the willingness of a nation to contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions decreases with its share of these emissions. This is in accordance with psychological findings, but poses a problem for political decision-makers. When communicating with the public, scientists ought to be aware of their responsibility to use a language that is understood by laypeople. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Oxides; Population statistics; Global warming; carbon dioxide; decision making; environmental policy; global warming; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; national economy",,,,,,"(2007) Global Warming: A Self-inflicted, Very Serious Problem, According to More Than Half the World's Online Population, , http://www2.acnielsen.com/news/20070129.shtml, Accessed 12 February 2007; Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Int Symp Inf Theory, 2, pp. 267-281; Brechin, S.R., Objective problems, subjective values, and global environmentalism: Evaluating the postmaterialist argument and challenging a new explanation (1999) Soc Sci Q, 80, pp. 793-809; Brechin, S.R., Comparative public opinion and knowledge on global climatic change and the Kyoto Protocol: The U.S. versus the world (2003) Int J Sociol Soc Policy, 23, pp. 106-134; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , 2 Springer New York; Corbett, J.B., Durfee, J.L., Testing public (un)certainty of science (2004) Sci Commun, 26, pp. 129-151; Dunlap, R.E., Lay perceptions of global risk: Public views of global warming in cross-national context (1998) Int Sociol, 13, pp. 473-498; Dunlap, R.E., Mertig, A.G., Global concern for the environment: Is affluence a prerequisite (1995) J Soc Issues, 51, pp. 121-137; Dunwoody, S., Moser, S.C., Dilling, L., The challenge of trying to make a difference using media messages (2007) Creating a Climate for Change: Communicating Climate Change and Facilitating Social Change, pp. 89-104. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Hardin, G., The tragedy of the commons (1968) Science, 162, pp. 1243-1248; Hersch, J., Viscusi, W.K., The generational divide in support for environmental policies: European evidence (2006) Clim Change, 77, pp. 121-136; (2006) World Economic Outlook Database, , http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/02/data/index.aspx, Accessed 12 February 2007; (2007) World Economic Outlook Database, , http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/groups.htm, Accessed 18 December 2007; The psychology of global environmental change (1991) Int J Psychol, 26, pp. 547-673. , Int J Psychol. 5; Climate change and society (1998) Int Sociol, 13, pp. 421-516. , Int Sociol. 4; Krosnick, J.A., Holbrook, A.L., Lowe, L., Visser, P.S., The origins and consequences of democratic citizens' policy agendas: A study of popular concern about global warming (2006) Clim Change, 77, pp. 7-43; Leiserowitz, A., American risk perception: Is climate change dangerous (2005) Risk Anal, 25, pp. 1433-1442; Leiserowitz, A., Climate change risk perception and policy preferences: The role of affect, imagery, and values (2006) Clim Change, 77, pp. 45-72; Leiserowitz, A., Moser, S.C., Dilling, L., Communicating the risks of global warming: American risk perceptions, affective images, and interpretive communities (2007) Creating a Climate for Change: Communicating Climate Change and Facilitating Social Change, pp. 44-63. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Lorenzoni, I., Pidgeon, N.F., Public views on climate change: European and USA perspectives (2006) Clim Change, 77, pp. 73-95; Mahlman, J.D., Science and nonscience concerning human-caused climate warming (1998) Annu Rev Energy Environ, 23, pp. 83-106; Marland, G., Boden, T.A., Andres, R.J., Global, regional, and national fossil fuel CO2 emissions (2006) Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change, , http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/meth_reg.htm, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (ed) Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge.
