Attention is drawn to a new online video on the life and contributions of the economist Adam Smith, and to development of the smallest-ever diamond transistor. The death of the experimental psychologist Richard Gregory is reported. Design/methodology/approach: The aim is to review developments on the internet, especially those of general cybernetic interest. Findings: The main finding is that currently accepted views of anthropomorphic global warming are subject to serious doubt. Practical implications: It seems likely that the ""greenhouse"" effect of carbon dioxide can be discounted, allowing major revisions of energy policy and increased exploitation of fossil fuel resources, though with attention also to renewable sources that will be needed when the fossil fuels run out. The diamond transistor will eventually allow increase in speed in digital devices. Originality/value: It is hoped this is a valuable periodic review. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cybernetics; Experimental psychology; Global warming; Nanotechnology; Transistors",,,,,,,"Gregory, R.L., Models and the location of function in the central nervous system (1959) Mechanisation of Thought Processes, 2, pp. 669-689. , HMSO, London; Lovelock, J., (2006) The Revenge of Gaia: Why the Earth is Fighting Back - And How We Can Still Save Humanity, p. 10. , Allen Lane, London; Watson, A.J., Lovelock, J.E., Biological homeostasis of the global environment: The parable of Daisyworld (1983) Tellus, 35 B, pp. 284-289","Andrew, A.
