This is to acknowledge the fact that carbon emissions inflict global costs that are not borne by emitters. This paper advocates that all activities emitting or saving carbon emissions should internalize the carbon cost inflicted or avoided by new projects involving CO2. Considering the current wide range of carbon cost estimates, the paper recommends that a two-stage approach be adopted. Firstly, incorporate carbon costs in project analysis only theoretically in order to differentiate objectively among alternative designs involving carbon emissions of varying degrees. Different estimates of the costs of a ton of carbon would be used in order to test the sensitivity of rates of return to alternative carbon costings. While this process would have the effect of screening the allocation of scarce investment funds among projects that affect global warming in different degrees, it should be viewed as only a first step. Secondly, we advocate a rigorous process of passing through estimated carbon costs to the ultimate users of the services of carbon-emitting projects and processes. It is this ultimate process that will secure the urgently needed transition from the current dependence on fossil fuels to more benign sources of energy that would reduce climate-change risks. Since the time available is limited, the paper points out the urgency of these proposals that are crucial for sustainability.","Carbon; Climate change; Cost internalization; Global warming; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Project analysis; Sustainability",,,,,,,"Campbell, C.J., Laherre, J.H., (1995) The World's Oil Supply 1930-1950, , Petroconsultants Pty Ltd; Enting, I.G., Wigley, T.M.L., Heimann, M., Future emissions and concentrations of carbon dioxide (1994) Australia, CSIRO, Div.
