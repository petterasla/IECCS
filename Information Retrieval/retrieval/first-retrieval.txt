[u' The magnitude of daily minimum temperature increase is greater than that of\r\ndaily maximum temperature increase under climate warming. This study was\r\nconducted to examine whether changes in soil respiration under diurnal\r\nwarming are equal to the summed changes under day and night warming in a\r\ntemperate steppe in northern China. A full factorial design with day and\r\nnight warming was used in this study, including control, day\r\n(06:00 a.m.\u201306:00 p.m., local time) warming, night (06:00 p.m.\u201306:00 a.m.) warming, and diurnal\r\nwarming. Day warming showed no effect on soil respiration, whereas night\r\nwarming significantly increased soil respiration by 7.1% over the 3\r\ngrowing seasons in 2006\u20132008. The insignificant effect of day warming on\r\nsoil respiration could be attributable to the offset of the direct positive\r\neffects of increased temperature by the indirect negative effects via\r\naggravating water limitation and suppressing ecosystem C assimilation. The\r\npositive effects of night warming on soil respiration were largely due to\r\nthe stimulation of ecosystem C uptake and substrate supply via\r\novercompensation of plant photosynthesis. Changes in both soil respiration\r\n(+20.7 g C m', u' y', u') and GEP (\u22122.8 g C m', u' y', u') under\r\ndiurnal warming are smaller than their summed changes (+40.0 and +24.6 g C m', u' y', u', respectively)\r\nunder day and night warming. Our findings\r\nthat the effects of diurnal warming on soil respiration and gross ecosystem\r\nproductivity are not equal to the summed effects of day and night warming\r\nare critical for model simulation and projection of climate-carbon feedback.']
