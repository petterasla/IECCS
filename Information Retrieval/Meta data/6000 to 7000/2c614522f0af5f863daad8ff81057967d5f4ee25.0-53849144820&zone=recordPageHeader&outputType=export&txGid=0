Regional climate model [fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5)-Noah] simulations are run for the first and last five years of the twenty-first century following the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 experiment. Then the precipitation events are classified according to the water vapor fluxes that created them. At present most of the region's precipitation is from westerly water vapor fluxes. Results indicate that the region will increasingly get its precipitation from large events that are dominated by southerly water vapor fluxes. The increase in these events will occur in the transition seasons, especially autumn. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; global warming; hydrometeorology; moisture flux; moisture transfer; precipitation (climatology); water vapor",,,,,,"Ball, G.H., Hall, D.J., A clustering technique for summarizing multivariate data (1967) Behav.
