Planetary sources of renewable energy (wind, water, sun) are estimated and deemed sufficient to more than replace all fossil fuel. Cost and magnitude of required infrastructure then imply long construction times during which pollution and global warming may have time to become unacceptable. Advantages of nuclear energy as a transition facilitator which avoids them are examined, along with means to alleviate public anxieties about its use. The conclusions are that the main obstacles to a healthy hydrogen-based world are less scientific, technical or economic than due to inertia, ignorance, blindness, stupidity, fear and mistaken narrow interests, and that there will be enough time to overcome them if we attack the problems more energetically and each other less so. © 1995.",,"Air pollution; Costs; Economics; Estimation; Finance; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Nuclear energy; Solar energy; Water power; Wind power; Energy demands; Environmental demands; Environmental problems; Hydrogen energy economy; Inertia; Renewable energy; Synergy; Transition facilitator; Hydrogen fuels",,,,,,"Veziroǧlu, One or two hundred papers appear annually on all phases of the hydrogen economy in the monthly (1975) Current bibliographies are given several times a year.
