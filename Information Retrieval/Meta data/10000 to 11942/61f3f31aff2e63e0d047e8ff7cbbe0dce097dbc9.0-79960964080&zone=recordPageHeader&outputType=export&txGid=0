An expanded system boundary was employed to compare by-products. Life cycle cost was analyzed through the entire disposal process, which included discharge, separate collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal stages, all of which were included in the system boundary. Costs and benefits were estimated by an avoided impact. Environmental benefits of each system per 1tonne of food waste management were estimated using carbon prices resulting from CO 2 reduction by avoided impact, as well as the prices of by-products such as animal feed, compost, and electricity. We found that the cost of landfilling was the lowest, followed by co-digestion. The benefits of wet feeding systems were the highest and landfilling the lowest. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy recovery; Environmental impact; Food waste; Global warming; Life cycle cost","Animal feed; Carbon price; Codigestion; Costs and benefits; Disposal process; Energy recovery; Environmental benefits; Feeding system; Food waste; Food waste disposers; Landfilling; Life cycle cost; Lifecycle costs; Resource recovery; South Korea; System boundary; Anaerobic digestion; Carbon dioxide; Composting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Feeding; Global warming; Incineration; Life cycle; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Sludge disposal; Waste management; Waste incineration; carbon dioxide; environmental impact; food; global warming; incineration; landfill; life cycle analysis; sludge; solid waste; waste disposal; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; article; composting; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; dry feeding; energy recovery; environmental impact assessment; food waste disposer; greenhouse effect; incineration; landfill; life cycle assessment; priority journal; recycling; reduction kinetics; sludge digestion; South Korea; waste disposal; waste management; wet feeding; Garbage; Global Warming; Models, Economic; Republic of Korea; South Korea; Animalia",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Battistoni, P., Fatone, F., Passacantandoa, D., Bolzonella, D., Application of food waste disposers and alternate cycles process in small-decentralized towns: a case study (2007) Water Research, 41, pp. 893-903; Bogner, J., Ahmed, M.A., Diaz, C., Faaij, A., Gao, Q., Hashimoto, S., Mareckova, K., Monni, S., (2007), Waste management.
