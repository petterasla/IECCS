Models forecast continued changes in temperature, salinity, and solar radiation (insolation) in the world's oceans as consequences of global warming. Many species with a swimming jellyfish stage also have a benthic stage that asexually produces buds and new jellyfish (ephyrae). This perennial benthic stage probably determines the numbers of jellyfish in the population. In this study, polyps of the moon jellyfish Aurelia labiata from Puget Sound, Washington, USA, were tested in 9 combinations of temperature (7, 10, 15°C) and salinity (20, 27, 34) in the dark, and in 9 combinations of photoperiod (12, 8, and 4 h d-1) and light intensity (1 screen, 2 screens, opaque) at ambient salinity (27) and temperature (15°C). Another experiment tested polyps in treatments of 10, 15, and 20°C. Survival of the initial polyps in all treatments was high (83 to 100 %). Temperature, salinity, and their combination dramatically affected the numbers of ephyrae produced (from nearly 0 at 7°C to 42 ephyrae polyp -1 at 15°C), the percentages of ephyrae out of total asexual reproduction (≤12 % at 7°C to 89 % at 20°C), and the delay before ephyra production (&gt;81 d at 7°C but only 39 to 46 d at 15°C). Thus, all results showed that more jellyfish were produced with increasing temperature. Long photoperiod and highest light intensity greatly accelerated strobilation, with polyps in 12 h light strobilating 30 to 40 d before those in other treatments. Polyps receiving the most light strobilated most frequently. In situ conditions showed that light increased much more rapidly than temperature before strobilisation, suggesting that light may be the more important signal. I suggest that the light-sensitive hormone melatonin, or a precursor like serotonin, coordinates the timing of strobilation in A. labiata with the seasonal light cycle. © Inter-Research 2007.","Bloom; Climate; Global warming; Jellyfish; Light; Photoperiod; Salinity; Temperature; Zooplankton","algal bloom; asexual reproduction; experimental study; global warming; hormone; jellyfish; photoperiod; polyp; salinity; solar radiation; survival; temperature effect; zooplankton; North America; Puget Sound; United States; Washington [United States]; Aurelia labiata; Scyphozoa",,,,,,"Alley, R., Berntsen, T., Bindoff, N.L., Chen, Z., Climate change 2007: The physical science basis (2007) summary for policymakers: Contribution of Working Group I to the 4th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , www.ipcc.ch, IPCC, Available at; Arai, M.N., (1997) A functional biology of Scyphozoa, , Chapman & Hall, London; Arai, M.N., Predation on pelagic coelenterates: A review (2005) J Mar Biol Assoc UK, 85, pp. 523-536; Attrill, M.J., Wright, J., Edwards, M., Climate-related increases in jellyfish frequency suggest a more gelatinous future for the North Sea (2007) Limnol Oceanogr, 52, pp. 480-485; Balzer, I., Hardeland, R., Thermophotoperiodism (1996) Vistas on biorhythmicity, pp. 37-50. , Greppin H, Degli Agosti R, Bonzon M eds, University of Geneva, p; Båmstedt, U., Lane, J., Martinussen, M.B., Bioenergetics of ephyra larvae of the scyphozoan jellyfish Aurelia aurita in relation to temperature and salinity (1999) Mar Biol, 135, pp. 89-98; Behrenfeld, M.J., O'Malley, R.T., Siegel, D.A., McClain, C.R., Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity (2006) Nature, 444, pp. 752-755; Boero, F., Bouillon, J., Piraino, S., Schmid, V., Asexual reproduction in the Hydrozoa (Cnidaria) (2002) Reproductive biology of invertebrates XI: Progress in asexual reproduction, pp. 141-158. , Hughes RN ed, Oxford & IBH Publ Co, New Dehli, p; Boeuf, G., Falcon, J., Photoperiod and growth in fish (2001) Vie Milieu, 51, pp. 247-266; Brodeur, R.D., Decker, M.B., Ciannelli, L., Purcell, J.E., Bond, N.A., Stabeno, P.J., Hunt Jr, G.L., Acuna, E., Rise and fall of jellyfish in the Bering, , in press, Sea in relation to climate regime shifts.
