First, concerning the impact of global warming: what are the prospects for the inclusion of nonmarket values in estimates of the damages of warming? The second question relates to the role of the Principles and Guidelines as the supporting document for water resource projects. Are tools for nonmarket valuation, as found in the Principles and Guidelines satisfactory for water resource project evaluation with a changing climate? The potential effects of climate change are so numerous and subtle that it would be prohibitively costly to measure them all. Thus a comprehensive program for including nonmarket damages as part of the costs of global warming seems ill-advised. Where specific concerns arise, researchers may learn from small scale studies. Many of the damages of global warming are diminished by the ability of humans to adapt at small costs, especially the nonuse component of nonmarket values. When the question concerns minor water resource projects, the gains from including extra effects induced by global warming seem to be small compared with the costs. The Principles and Guidelines does not reflect current practices in benefit estimation. However, it is not clear that this is a serious problem, because most practitioners continue to revise their understanding of valuation methods. If the Principles and Guidelines were to be revised, it would make sense to provide more current guidelines for all of the behavioral models and contingent valuation. Revisions of the Principles and Guidelines should not do anything special for anthropocentrically induced climate change.",,"climate change; environmental economics; non-market valuation; water resources",,,,,,"Arrow, K., Solow, R., Portney, P., Learner, E., Radner, R., Schuman, H., (1993) Report of the NOAA Panel on Contingent Valuation, , U.S. Department of Commerce; Bartik, T., Evaluation the Benefits of Non-marginal Reductions in Pollution Using Information on Defensive Expenditures (1988) Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 15, pp. 111-127; Bockstael, N.E., McConnell, K.E., Strand, I.E., Recreation Benefits (1991) Measuring the Demand for Environmental Quality, pp. 227-270. , (Braden and Kolstad, eds.), North Holland Press; Braden, J.B., Kolstad, C., (1991) Measuring the Demand for Environmental Quality, , New York: North Holland Publishers; Carson, R.T., Hanemann, W.M., Kopp, R.J., Krosnick, J.A., Mitchell, R.C., Presser, S., Ruud, P.A., Smith, V.K., (1994) Prospective Interim Lost Use Value Due to DDT and PCB Contamination in the Southern California Bight, , NOAA Contract No. DGNC-1-00007; Carson, R., Flores, N., Martin, K., Wright, J., Contingent Valuation and Revealed Preference (1996) Land Economics, 72, pp. 80-99; Cline, W., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics: Washington; Cummings, R., Brookshire, D., Schulze, W., (1986) Valuing Environmental Goods: An Assessment of Contingent Valuation, , Rowman and Allanheld: Totowa, N.J; Desvousgcs, W.H., Measuring Natural Resource Damages with Contingent Valuation: Tests of Validity and Reliability (1993) Contingent Valuation: A Critical Assessment, pp. 91-164. , J.
