The paper explores these claims through the deployment of a dynamic, nonlinear, macro-econometric simulation called the Energy-Environment-Economy (E3) Model at the Global Scale (E3MG). In contrast to the generally held view, we argue that overall EU competitiveness may improve. We also argue that unilateral action may be effective in reducing global emissions relative to a no-climate-change-action scenario, although the reduction is very small. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","competitiveness; global warming; leakage; unilateral climate action",,,,,,,"Adams, J., Globalisation, trade, and environment (1997) Globalisation and Environment: Preliminary Perspectives, p. 184. , Paris: OECD; Aldy, J.E., Assessing the costs of regulatory proposals for reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (2007) Assessing U.S. Climate Policy Options.

It is an important measure because there are concerns about the effectiveness of unilateral action since there is potential for carbon-intensive production to migrate outside the EUCGE models typically assume a global social planner to maximise welfare, full information over space and time, perfect competition and identical firms in each sector, homogenous composite energy-intensive goods, relocation of production without extra costs, and increasing returns included in only one sectorThe assumption of the representative agent, commonly adopted in equilibrium models, is that the behaviour of an economic group is adequately represented by that of a group, each of whose members have the identical characteristics of the average of the group. Barker and de-Ramon (2006) test this assumption and show that parameter estimates of the effects of technological change on industrial employment for 18 regions of Europe are significantly different across industries and regions. In other word, the assumption that each industry has the same responses as an average (borrowed from the literature) is not justified and misleadingThe estimations of E3MG’s export equations “protect against both spurious correlations (by using cointegration techniques) and the simultaneity between the dependent and the explanatory variables (by using instrumental variables or some other means)” (Barker et al., 2006, p.245)The advantages of using this combined approach for climate change mitigation analysis have been reviewed in Grubb et al. (2002)Other measures refer, for example, to extra investments in the vehicles fleet through regulatory measures, which is treated separately from other sectors. Otherwise, the stabilisation target is achieved through global ETS through permit auctioning for the energy sector, where revenues raised by each region are spent within each of the corresponding region, whereas for the non-energy sectors a carbon tax is applied, again assuming revenue recycling. The revenue recycling is designed to maintain macroeconomic inflation neutrality by reductions in average indirect taxesLong- run price homogeneity is assumed in E3MG","Barker, T.; Cambridge Centre for Climate Change Mitigation Research (4CMR), Department of Land Economy, University of CambridgeUnited Kingdom",,,,,,,,17582083,,,,"English","Int.
