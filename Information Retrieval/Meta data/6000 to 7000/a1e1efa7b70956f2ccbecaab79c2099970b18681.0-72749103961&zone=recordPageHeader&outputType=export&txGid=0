Forty-four sludge samples were collected from 15 cities within Yangtze River Delta region, and the total contents of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni) were investigated. The results demonstrated that the contents of heavy metals in sludge samples varied significantly. The average contents of heavy metals followed an order of Zn&gt;Cu&gt;Ni&gt;Cr&gt;Pb&gt;Cd. Industrial sludges were more polluted than domestic sludge and mixed flow sludge, according to pollutant indexes. The extracted three principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC 3, ranked by contribution) indicated good expressions to the initial 6 variables. The cumulative proportion of the three principal components was 82.0%. PC1 represented nearly 50% of information of initial variables and mainly contributed to the enrichment of heavy metals. Heavy metals content and measurement should be considered to reduce the potential eco-environmental safety and public health risk associated with the application of sewage sludge. ©2009 IEEE.","Concentration; Heavy metal; Principal component analysis; Sewage sludge; Yangtze River Delta","Concentration; Domestic sludge; Environmental risks; Environmental safety; Heavy metals content; Industrial sludge; Mixed flows; Principal Components; Public health risks; Sludge samples; Total content; Wastewater treatment plants; Yangtze river delta; Bioinformatics; Cadmium; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Chromium; Health risks; Lead; Metals; Principal component analysis; Rivers; Sewage sludge; Smelting; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Zinc; River pollution",,,,,,"Matthews, P.J., Sewage sludge disposal in the UK: A new challenge for the next twenty years (1992) Journal of the Institution of Water and Environmental Management, 6, pp. 51-559; Kelly, J.J., Häggblom, M., TateIII, R.L., Effects of the land application of sewage sludge on soil heavy metal concentrations and soil microbial communities (1999) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 31, pp. 1347-1470; Nicholson, F.A., Smith, S.R., Alloway, B.J., Carlton-Smith, C., Chambers, B.J., An inventory of heavy metals inputs to agricultural soils in England and Wales (2003) The Science of The Total Environment, 311, pp. 205-219; Walter, I., Martinez, F., Cala, V., Heavy metal speciation and phytotoxic effects of three representative sewage sludges for agricultural uses (2006) Environmental Pollution, 139, pp. 507-514; Chen, T.B., Huang, Q.F., Gao, D., Zheng, Y.Q., Wu, J.F., Heavy metal concentrations and their decreasing trends in sewage sludge of China (2003) Acta Scientiae Circumstantiae, 23, pp. 561-569; Sogbedji, J.M., van Es, J.M., Yang, C.L., Geohring, L.D., Magdoff, F.R., Nitrate leaching and nitrogen budget as affected by maize nitrogen rate and soil type (2000) Journal of Environmental Quality, 29, pp. 1813-1820; (2002) China Environment Yearbook, , Committee on China Environment Yearbook, China Environment Yearbook Press.
