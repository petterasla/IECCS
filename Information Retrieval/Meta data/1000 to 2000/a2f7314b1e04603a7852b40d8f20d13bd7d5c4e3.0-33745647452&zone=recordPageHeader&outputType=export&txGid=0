The region will experience dynamic development in the next century. Even without climate change, rapid growth in the demographic and economic situations of the area will cause drastic changes in the local and global environment. Impacts of climate change will make the situation even more complex. In order to assess the impact on this dynamic Asian-Pacific region, we first estimate several kinds of direct physical changes to occur within the probable range of global temperature increase, and identify the impact vs. response curves of the climate changes. In this paper, we describe the impacts on water resources, crop production and natural ecosystems focusing on spatial changes. Typical outcomes of the model calculations for the Asian-Pacific region are summarized as follows: Following global average temperature increase of 2°C, the median of estimated national average temperature increases ranges between 1.25~2.76°C in the region. The precipitation changes range between +1~34%. The variance among the estimations is large, and some estimate show more than a 3.5 °C temperature increase. The medium change in runoff ranged between -7~68%. Slight decrease in rice production is expected in most of the countries. The productivity of wheat will decrease significantly in Bangladesh, India and other tropical countries. The variance in productivity changes among the estimations is large. The relation between the impacts on crop production and global temperature change reveals no discernibly logical pattern by either crops or countries.","Climate change; Crop production; Global environment; Water resource",,,,,,,"Asian development bank (1994) Climate Change in Asia, , Manila, Philippines; AIM project team, (1996) Technical structure of AIM/impact model, AIM Interim Paper, , IP-95-106, Tsukuba, Japan; Boer, G.J., McFarlane, N., Lazane, M., (1989) Equilibrium response studies with the CCC climate model, , Pers, Com; Erda, L., Bolhofer, W.C., Huq, S., Lenhart, S., Mukherjee, S.K., Smith, J.B., Wisniewski, J., (1996) Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation in Asia and Pacific, , Kluwer; FAO (1992) Crop Water Requirements, , Irrigation and Drainage Paper-24.
