The maps illustrate location and strength of the up and downwelling limbs of thermohaline-forced overturning loops whose stability in the face of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations is of major concern in century-scale climate prediction. The up and downwelling limbs simulated by the four models for present-day greenhouse gas concentrations are compared with observational estimates. Predicted changes in the overturning brought about by gradually rising atmospheric CO2 content are compared model-to-model. While all four models predict some decline in the rate of Atlantic overturning during CO2-induced global warming, the geographic layout of the overturning circulations in each model is found to be insensitive to the changing climate. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
