An unforced internal component that varies on multidecadal time scales is identified by a new statistical method that maximizes integral time scale. This component, called the internal multidecadal pattern (IMP), is stochastic and hence does not contribute to trends on long time scales; however, it can contribute significantly to short-term trends. Observational estimates indicate that the trend in the spatially averaged ""well observed"" sea surface temperature (SST) due to the forced component has an approximately constant value of 0.1 K decade-1, while the IMP can contribute about 60.08 K decade-1 for a 30-yr trend. The warming and cooling of the IMP matches that of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and is of sufficient amplitude to explain the acceleration in warming during 1977-2008 as compared to 1946-77, despite the forced component increasing at the same rate during these two periods. The amplitude and time scale of the IMP are such that its contribution to the trend dominates that of the forced component on time scales shorter than 16 yr, implying that the lack of warming trend during the past 10 yr is not statistically significant. Furthermore, since the IMP varies naturally on multidecadal time scales, it is potentially predictable on decadal time scales, providing a scientific rationale for decadal predictions. While the IMP can contribute significantly to trends for periods of 30 yr or shorter, it cannot account for the 0.8°C warming that has been observed in the twentieth-century spatially averaged SST. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Decadal variability; Global warming","Anthropogenic forcing; Atlantic multidecadal oscillations; Climate simulation; Decadal timescale; Decadal variability; Forced component; Integral time scale; Internal dynamics; Multi-decadal time scale; Multidecadal variability; Sea surface temperatures; Time-scales; Twentieth century; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Time measurement; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; climate modeling; decadal variation; global warming; sea surface temperature; stochasticity; twentieth century",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Tett, S.F.B., Checking for model consistency in optimal fingerprinting (1999) Climate Dyn., 15, pp. 419-434; Barnett, T.P., Long-term trends in surface temperature over the oceans (1984) Mon.
