It brings together knowledge and expertise from variety of disciplines ranging from different aspects of ecology to chemistry, microbiology to statistics, soil science to biology and water management to toxicology. Environmental or atmospheric scientists are not the stereotype alarmists who press the siren button of 'global warming' but they strive and employ transdisciplinary knowledge to develop science and technology based strategy to address the sustainability of air, water and soil. Moreover, the responsibility of protecting the environment could not be solely allocated onto the shoulder of an environmental scientist, but in order to preserve and safeguard the air that we breathe, the water that we drink and the land we step in, each of us the chemists, the physicists, and the biologists should strategically design our research in a more environmentally friendly manner or employing green methods. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Claisen rearrangement reaction; Cycloaddition reaction; Green chemistry; Green nano","Siren",,,,,,"Anastas, P.T., Warner, J.C., (1998) Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice, p. 30. , By permission of Oxford University Press, New York: Oxford University Press; Anastas, P.T., Zimmerman, J.B., Design through the twelve principles of green engineering (2005) Environ Sci Technol, 37, pp. 94A-101A; Ferry, J.F., Craig, P., Hexel, C., Sisco, P., Frey, R., Pennington, P.L., Fulton, M.H., Shaw, T.J., Transfer of gold nanoparticles from the water column to the estuarine food web (2009) Nature Nanotechnol, 4, pp. 441-444; Li, R., Chen, W., Kobayashi, H., Ma, C., Platinum-nanoparticle-loaded bismuth oxide: An efficient plasmonic photocatalyst active under visible light (2010) Green Chem, , doi: 10.1039/b917233e; Narayan, S., Muldoon, J., Finn, M.G., Fokin, V.V., Kolb, H.C., Sharpless, K.B., Unique reactivity of organic compounds in aqueous suspension (2005) Angew Chem Int Ed, 21, p. 3157; Nowicki, J., Claisen, Cope and related rearrangements in the synthesis of flavour and fragrance compounds (2000) Molecules, 5, pp. 1033-1050; Noyori, R., Pursuing practical elegance in chemical synthesis (2005) Chem Commun, 14, pp. 1807-1811; Schmidt, K.F., (2007) Green nanotechnology: It is easier than you think, , PEN 8; Yadav, G.D., Lande, S.V., UDCa T-5: A novel and efficient solid superacid catalyst for claisen rearrangement of substituted allyl phenyl ethers (2007) Synth Commun, 37 (6), pp. 941-946","Sanghamitra, N.
