The regional monthly mean significant wave height (MMSWH) is selected as the defining wave climate parameter and averaging multiple data sources within a region is found to significantly reduce data gaps. Two 12-year periods are compared, showing significant temporal variability but high correlation between regions, allowing the further collapse of the data to a northern and a southern region. Correlations between MMSWH records with three global-scale climate indices are investigated and only the North Pacific Index (NPI), a measure of atmospheric pressure in the Gulf of Alaska, shows strong correlation. The Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) is less correlated and the Pacific Decadal Index (PDO), which is a measure of ocean surface temperature, provides no significant correlation. A method for displaying multiple correlations is developed that shows the mean of all MMSWH records that occur at unique temporal combinations of two climate indices. The graphics depicting the mean wave height as a function of NPI and MEI for the two 12-year periods are shown to be very instructive in establishing why the two periods are so different. On the contrary, the same procedure with PDO substituted for MEI produces uniform distributions with little interpretive value. Century-scale variation in the climate indices is investigated, and significant linear trends are found for NPI and MEI, both consistent with causing increases in mean wave energy in these regions. Causal relationships for the observed correlations are discussed, and conclusions are reached indicating that global warming is a likely contributor to observed increases in wave intensity in the North Pacific. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2011.","buoy; climate change; ENSO; MEI; NPI; Pacific Ocean; PDO; wave climate; Waves","atmospheric pressure; database; deep water; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; wave climate; wave energy; Gulf of Alaska; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States",,,,,,"Adams, P.N., Inman, D.L., Graham, N.E., Southern california deep-water wave climate: Characterization and application to coastal processes (2008) Journal of Coastal Research, 24 (4), pp. 1022-1035; Allan, J., Komar, P.D., Are ocean wave heights increasing in the eastern north pacific (2000) Eos Transactions, 81, pp. 561-567. , AGU; Allan, J.C., Komar, P.D., Climate controls on US west coast erosion processes (2006) Journal of Coastal Research, 22 (3), pp. 511-529; Bromirski, P.D., Cayan, D.R., Flick, R.E., Wave spectral energy variability in the northeast pacific (2005) Journal of Geophysical Research, 110, p. 15. , C03005; Reanalysis of historical climate data for key atmospheric features: Implications for attribution of causes of observed change (2008) A Report by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research, p. 156. , CCSP Climate Change Science Program Asheville North Carolina: National Climatic Data Center; Graham, N.E., Diaz, H.F., Evidence for intensification of north pacific winter cyclones since 1948 (2001) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 82 (9), pp. 1869-1893; Summary for policymakers (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , IPCC Solomon S.
