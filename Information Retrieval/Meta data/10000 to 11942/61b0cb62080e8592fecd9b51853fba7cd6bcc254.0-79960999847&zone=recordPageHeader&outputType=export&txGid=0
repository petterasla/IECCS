This study examined the effect of increased water temperature to 3°C above ambient on the swimming and metabolic performance of 10 species of damselfishes (Pomacentridae) representing evolutionary lineages from two subfamilies and four genera. Five distinct performance measures were tested: (a) maximum swimming speed (Ucrit), (b) gait-transition speed (the speed at which they change from strictly pectoral to pectoral-and-caudal swimming, Up-c), (c) maximum aerobic metabolic rate (MO2-MAX), (d) resting metabolic rate (MO2-REST), and (e) aerobic scope (ratio of MO2-MAX to MO2-REST, ASC). Relative to the control (29°C), increased temperature (32°C) had a significant negative effect across all performance measures examined, with the magnitude of the effect varying greatly among closely related species and genera. Specifically, five species spanning three genera (Dascyllus, Neopomacentrus and Pomacentrus) showed severe reductions in swimming performance with Ucrit reduced in these species by 21.3-27.9% and Up-c by 32.6-51.3%. Furthermore, five species spanning all four genera showed significant reductions in metabolic performance with aerobic scope reduced by 24.3-64.9%. Comparisons of remaining performance capacities with field conditions indicate that 32°C water temperatures will leave multiple species with less swimming capacity than required to overcome the water flows commonly found in their respective coral reef habitats. Consequently, unless adaptation is possible, significant loss of species may occur if ocean warming of ≥3°C arises. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Energy; Genetic adaptation; Global warming; Labriform; Oxygen; Resilience; Thermal acclimation","acclimation; adaptation; climate change; coral reef; ectothermy; global warming; metabolism; oxygen; teleost; temperature; Anthozoa; Dascyllus; Neopomacentrus; Pomacentridae; Pomacentrus; Teleostei",,,,,,"Allen, G.R., (1991) Damselfishes of the World, , Mergus Publishers, Melle; Bell, W.H., Terhune, L.D.B., Water tunnel design for fisheries research (1970) Fisheries Research Board Canada Technical Report, 195, pp. 1-69; Benjamin, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B-Statistical Methodology, 57, pp. 289-300. , a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing; Berkelmans, R., van Oppen, M.J.H., The role of zooxanthellae in the thermal tolerance of corals (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 2305-2312. , a 'nugget of hope' for coral reefs in an era of climate change; Blake, R.W., Fish functional design and swimming performance (2004) Journal of Fish Biology, 65, pp. 1193-1222; Clarke, A., Cost and consequences of evolutionary temperature adaptation (2003) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 18, pp. 573-581; Cooper, W.J., Smith, L.L., Westneat, M.W., Exploring the radiation of a diverse reef fish family (2008) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolotion, 52, pp. 1-16. , phylogenetics of the damselfishes (Pomacentridae), with new classifications based on molecular analyses of all genera; Donelson, J.M., Munday, P.L., McCormick, M.I., Nilsson, G.E., Acclimation to predicted ocean warming through developmental plasticity in a tropical reef fish (2011) Global Climate Change, 17, pp. 1712-1719; Donelson, J.M., Munday, P.L., McCormick, M.I., Pankhurst, N.W., Pankhurst, P.M., Effects of elevated water temperature and food on the reproductive performance of a coral reef fish (2010) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 401, pp. 233-243; Eme, J., Bennett, W.A., Critical tolerance polygons of tropical marine fishes from Sulawesi, Indonesia (2009) Journal of Thermal Biology, 34, pp. 220-225; Figueira, W.F., Booth, D.J., Increasing ocean temperatures allow tropical fishes to survive overwinter in temperate waters (2010) Global Change Biology, 16, pp. 506-516; Fisher, R., Bellwood, D.R., Undisturbed swimming behavior and nocturnal activity of coral reef fish larvae (2003) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 263, pp. 177-188; Fitt, W.K., Brown, B.E., Warner, M.E., Dunne, R.P., Coral bleaching (2001) Coral Reefs, 20, pp. 51-65. , interpretation of thermal tolerance limits and thermal thresholds in tropical corals; Fulton, C.J., Swimming speed performance in coral reef fishes (2007) Coral Reefs, 26, pp. 217-228. , field validations reveal distinct functional groups; Fulton, C.J., Bellwood, D.R., Wave-induced water motion and the functional implications for coral reef fish assemblages (2005) Limnology and Oceanography, 50, pp. 255-264; Fulton, C.J., Bellwood, D.R., Wainwright, P.C., Wave energy and swimming performance shape coral reef fish assemblages (2005) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences, 272, pp. 827-832; Gardiner, N.M., Munday, P.L., Nilsson, G.E., Counter-gradient variation in respiratory performance of coral reef fishes at elevated temperatures (2010) PLoS One, 5, pp. 1-13; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's coral reefs (1999) Marine and Freshwater Research, 50, pp. 839-866; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Mumby, P.J., Hooten, A.J., Coral reefs under rapid climate change and ocean acidification (2007) Science, 318, pp. 1737-1742; Holbrook, S.J., Russel, S.J., Staphens, J.S., Changes in assemblages of temperate reef fishes associated with a climate shift (1997) Ecological Applications, 7, pp. 1299-1310; Huey, R.B., Slatkin, M., Costs and benefits of lizard thermoregulation (1976) Quarterly Review of Biology, 51, pp. 363-384; Huey, R.B., Hertz, P.E., Is a jack-of-all temperatures a master of none?
