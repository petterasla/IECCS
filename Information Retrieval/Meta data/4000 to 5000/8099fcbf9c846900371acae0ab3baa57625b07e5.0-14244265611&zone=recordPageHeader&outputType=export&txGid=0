Warm temperature spells in spring have occurred much earlier in recent years, which explains in part the trend in the timing of the spring peak flow. In addition, a decrease in snow water equivalent and a general increase in winter precipitation are evident for many stations in the western United States. It appears that in recent decades more of the precipitation is coming as rain rather than snow. The trends are strongest at lower elevations and in the Pacific Northwest region, where winter temperatures are closer to the melting point; it appears that in this region in particular, modest shifts in temperature are capable of forcing large shifts in basin hydrologic response. It is speculated that these trends could be potentially a manifestation of the general global warming trend in recent decades and also due to enhanced ENSO activity. The observed trends in hydroclimatology over the western United States can have significant impacts on water resources planning and management.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Catchments; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydroclimatology; Melting point; Spring season; Winter season; Climatology; hydrological response; peak flow; precipitation (climatology); snow; streamflow; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",,,,,,"Aguado, E., Cayan, D.R., Riddle, L.G., Roos, M., Climatic fluctuations and the timing of West Coast streamflow (1992) J.
