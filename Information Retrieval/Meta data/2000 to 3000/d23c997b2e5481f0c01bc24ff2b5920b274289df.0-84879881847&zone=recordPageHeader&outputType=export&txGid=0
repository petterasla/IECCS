Annually laminated sediments from two lakes in Switzerland and Germany were sampled contiguously to assess the response of European vegetation to climate change ca. 8.2 ka with time resolution and precision comparable to those of the Greenland ice cores. The pollen assemblages show pronounced and immediate responses (0-20 yr) of terrestrial vegetation to the climatic change at 8.2 ka. A sudden collapse of Corylus avellana (hazel) was accompanied by the rapid expansion of Pinus (pine), Betula (birch), and Tilia (linden), and by the invasion of Fagus silvatica (beech) and Abies alba (fir). Vegetational changes suggest that climatic cooling reduced drought stress, allowing more drought-sensitive and taller growing species to out-compete Corylus avellana by forming denser forest canopies. Climate cooling at 8.2 ka and the immediate reorganization of terrestrial ecosystems has gone unrecognized by previous pollen studies. On the basis of our data we conclude that the early Holocene high abundance of C. avellana in Europe was climatically caused, and we question the conventional opinion that postglacial expansions of F. silvatica and A. alba were controlled by low migration rates rather than by climate. The close connection between climatic change and vegetational response at a subcontinental scale implies that forecasted global warming may trigger rapid collapses, expansions, and invasions of tree species.","Holocene; Paleoclimate; Paleoecology; Pollen analysis; Varves","Climatic cooling; Climate change; Ecosystems; Isotopes; Oxygen; Sediments; Vegetation; climate change; cooling; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; paleoclimate; paleoecology; palynology; vegetation type; Germany; Switzerland",,,,,,"Ammann, B., Birks, H.J.B., Brooks, S.J., Eicher, U., von Grafenstein, U., Hofmann, W., Lemdahl, G., Wick, L., Quantification of biotic responses to rapid climatic changes around the Younger Dryas - A synthesis (2000) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 159, pp. 313-347; Asthalter, K., Trockenperioden und Waldschaden aus forstgeschichtlicher und standortskundlicher Sicht (1984) Allgemeine Forstzeitschrift, 22, pp. 549-551; Clark, J.S., Merkt, J., Müller, H., Postglacial fire, vegetation, and human history on the northern Alpine forelands, south-western Germany (1989) Journal of Ecology, 77, pp. 897-925; Dansgaard, W., Johnsen, S.J., Clausen, H.B., Dahl-Jehnsen, D., Gundestrup, N.S., Hammer, C.U., Hvidberg, C.S., Bond, G., Evidence for general instability of past climate from a 250-kyr Ice-Core record (1993) Nature, 364, pp. 218-220; Davis, M.B., Climatic instability, time lags, and community disequilibrium (1984) Community Ecology, pp. 269-284. , Diamond, J., and Case, T.J., eds., New York, Harper & Row; Ellenberg, H., (1986) Vegetation Mitteleuropas mit den Alpen in ökologischer Sicht, , Stuttgart, Eugen Ulmer, 989 p; Fassl, K., (1996) Die bewertung von zeigerarten in europäischen pollendiagrammen für die rekonstruktion des klimas im Holozän, , Stuttgart, Gustav Fischer, 371 p; Grootes, P.M., Stuiver, M., White, J.W.C., Johnsen, S., Jouzel, J., Comparison of oxygen isotope records from the GISP2 and GRIP Greenland ice cores (1993) Nature, 366, pp. 552-554; Guiot, J., Harrison, S.P., Prentice, I.C., Reconstruction of Holocene precipitation patterns in Europe using pollen and lake-level data (1993) Quaternary Research, 40, pp. 139-149; Hajdas, I., Ivy, S.D., Beer, J., Bonani, G., Imboden, D., Lotter, A.F., Sturm, M., Suter, M., AMS radiocarbon dating and varve chronology of Lake Soppensee: 6000 to 12 000 14C years B.P (1993) Climate Dynamics, 9, pp. 107-116; Huntley, B., Rapid early-holocene migration and high abundance of hazel (Corylus avellana L.): Alternative hypotheses (1993) Climate Change and Human Impact on the Landscape, pp. 205-216. , Chambers, F.M., ed., London, Chapman & Hall; Huntley, B., Bartlein, P.J., Prentice, I.C., Climatic control of the distribution and abundance of beech (Fagus L.) in Europe and North America (1989) Journal of Biogeography, 16, pp. 551-560; Kullman, L., Non-analogous tree flora in the Scandes Mountains, Sweden, during the early Holocene - Macrofossil evidence of rapid geographic spread and response to palaeoclimate (1998) Boreas, 27, pp. 153-161; Kutzbach, J.E., Webb T.
