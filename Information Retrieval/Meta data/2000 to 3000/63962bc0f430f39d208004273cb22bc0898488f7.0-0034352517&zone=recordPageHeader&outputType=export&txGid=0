In this study, we have minimized systematic errors in the time series introduced by satellite orbital drift in an objective manner. This is done with the help of the onboard warm-blackbody temperature, which is used in the calibration of the MSU radiometer. The corrected MSU Channel 2 observations of the NOAA satellite series reveal that the vertically-weighted global-mean temperature of the atmosphere, with a peak weight near the mid troposphere, warmed at the rate of 0.13 ± 0.05 Kdecade-1 during 1980 to 1999. The global warming deduced from conventional meteorological data that have been corrected for urbanization effects agrees reasonably with this satellite-deduced result.",,"climate change; global warming; satellite data; Atmospheric temperature; Microwave devices; Radiometers; Troposphere; Weather satellites; Microwave sounding unit (MSU) radiometers; Global warming",,,,,,"Christy, J.R., Spencer, R.W., Lobl, E.S., Analysis of the merging procedure for the MSU daily time series (1998) J.
