The first three principal components together explain 78.21% of the total variance. The first principal component (PC1) accounts for 51.58% of the total variance, and represents consistent tree-growth variations in the northeastern TP. The second EOF mode reveals an opposite structure for the southern and northern parts of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, reflecting the effect of huge topography and associated atmospheric circulation on tree-growth anomalies. The third EOF mode represents an opposite structure for the eastern and western parts of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, possibly indicating the influence of different branches of atmospheric circulation system in this area. The EOF analysis results of instrumental precipitation data resemble those derived from the seven regional chronologies, providing further support that tree growth is a good indicator of regional precipitation variations. According to the PC1, dry conditions occurred in AD 1450-1510, 1631-1739, 1765-1833, 1866-1883 and 1921-1947, whereas periods of relatively wet years are identified for AD 1511-1630, 1740-1764, 1834-1865, 1884-1920 and 1948-2001. During the past 550 years, 28 years with extreme regional growth depressions was identified. These ring-width extremes generally occurred in century-scale dry periods. The years 1467, 1484, 1641, 1721, and 1928 with extreme tree-growth reductions in the northeastern TP are coeval with severe drought events in eastern China. In addition, the dry intervals or extreme growth depressions generally coincided with cold periods in the northeastern TP and vice versa, implying that the probability of occurrence of wet events in the northeastern TP will be higher in the future under the ongoing global warming. © The Author(s) 2010.","China; climate change; dendrochronology; paleoclimatology; Tibetan Plateau; tree growth","atmospheric circulation; climate variation; dendrochronology; drought; evergreen tree; global warming; growth rate; paleoatmosphere; paleoclimate; principal component analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; topographic effect; tree ring; variance analysis; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Juniperus",,,,,,"Bradley, R.S., Briffa, K.R., Cole, J., Hughes, M.K., Osborn, T.J., The climate of the last millennium (2003) Paleoclimate, Global Change and the Future, pp. 105-141. , In: Alverson KD, Bradley RS and Pedersen TF (eds), Berlin: Springer; Bräuning, A., Climate history of the Tibetan Plateau during the last 1000 years derived from a network of Juniper chronologies (2001) Dendrochronologia, 19 (1), pp. 127-137; Bräuning, A., Tree-ring evidence of 'Little Ice Age' glacier advances in southern Tibet (2006) The Holocene, 16, pp. 1-12; Bräuning, A., Mantwill, B., Summer temperature and summer monsoon history on the Tibetan Plateau during the last 400 years recorded by tree rings (2004) Geophysical Research Letters, 31, pp. L24205. , doi: 10.1029/2004GL020793; Briffa, K.R., Osborn, T.J., Schweingruber, F.H., Harris, I.C., Jones, P.D., Ssshiyatov, S.G., Low frequency temperature variations from northern tree ring density network (2001) Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, pp. 2929-2941; Briffa, K.R., Osborn, T.J., Schweingruber, F.H., Jones, P.D., Shiyatov, S.G., Vaganov, E.A., Tree-ring width and density data around the Northern Hemisphere: Part 2, spatio-temporal variability and associated climate patterns (2002) The Holocene, 12, pp. 759-789; (1990) Methods of Dendrochronology: Applications in the Environmental Sciences, , Cook ER and Kairiukstis A (eds), Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Cook, E.R., Briffa, K.R., Shiyatov, S., Mazepa, V., Estimation of the mean chronology (1990) Methods of Dendrochronology.
