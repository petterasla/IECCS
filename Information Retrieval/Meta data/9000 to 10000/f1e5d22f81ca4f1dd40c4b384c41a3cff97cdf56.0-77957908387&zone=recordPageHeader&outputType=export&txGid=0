Specifically, we evaluated the cumulative energy use; biotic resource use; and global warming, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions at each life cycle stage and in aggregate. We identify the importance of least environmental cost feed sourcing for reducing supply chain environmental impacts. We also highlight the need for more effective nutrient cycling in intensive aquaculture. The environmental trade-offs inherent in substituting technological inputs for ecosystem services in intensive pond-based versus lakebased production systems are discussed. We further call for more nuanced considerations of comparative environmental advantage in the production and interregional trade of food commodities than has been characteristic of historic food miles discussions. Significant opportunities exist for improving environmental performance in tilapia aquaculture. This product compares favorably, however, with several other fishery, aquaculture, and animal husbandry products, according to the suite of impact categories considered in this study. © 2010 by Yale University.","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Energy use; Fish farming; Industrial ecology; Seafood","Carbon footprint; Energy use; Fish farming; Industrial ecology; Seafood; Agriculture; Aquaculture; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Global warming; Lakes; Meats; Supply chains; Environmental impact; acidification; carbon budget; cichlid; ecosystem service; energy use; environmental impact; eutrophication; food processing; global warming; intensive culture; life cycle analysis; maritime transportation; nutrient cycling; pond culture; seafood; trade-off; Chicago; Illinois; Indonesia; Netherlands; Rotterdam; South Holland; United States; Animalia; Oreochromis niloticus; Tilapia",,,,,,"Andersen, J., Poulsen, H., Børsting, C., Rom, H., Sommer, S., Hutchings, N., (2001) Ammoniakemission fra landbruget siden midten af 80'erne [Ammonia emissions from agriculture since the mid 80s], , Faglig rapport fra DMU, nr. 353.
