Through FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) experiments in a paddy field, it has been confirmed that CO2-induced stomatal closure decreases transpiration, which causes a rise of leaf temperature (Tl). Thus, with elevated CO2, the probability of heat-induced spikelet sterility (HISS) of rice could increase. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) Measure differences in stomatal conductance (gs), panicle transpiration conductance (gp), Tl, and panicle temperature (Tp) of rice plants between FACE plots (E-CO2) and ambient plots (A-CO2) at Wuxi, China (31°37' N, 120°28' E) at heading and flowering stages. (2) Model the heat balance on a panicle surface. (3) Simulate Tp and clarify the impacts of FACE on T p using the model. Panicles emerged and flowered about 4 days earlier in E-CO2 than in A-CO2. The measured Tp was 1 - 2°C higher in E-CO2 than in A-CO2, which was equivalent to or even higher than the difference in Tl between in the two plots. The gp decreased with panicle age after heading, while gs increased asymptotically with the increase of photosynthetically active radiation. But, under both CO2 conditions, gp was not significantly different for the same days after heading. By modelling heat balance on a panicle surface and by simulating Tp, influences of elevated CO2 on Tp were quantified. First, lower g p due to older age after flowering. Second, higher air temperature (Ta) followed by higher Tl. Third, higher long wave radiation emitted from leaves (Ll). The effects of Ta and gp on Tp were significant but the effect of Ll on Tp was not significant. On the same number of days after heading, the net effect of gp on Tp would be almost zero. Therefore, raised Ta would be a critical factor for the increase in Tp.","Free-air CO2 enrichment; Heading and flowering stage of rice; Heat balance on a panicle; Panicle temperature; Panicle transpiration conductance",,,,,,,"Ishihara, K., Kiyota, E., Imaizumi, N., Transpiration and photosynthesis characteristics of the panicle in comparison with the flag leaf in the rice plant (1990) Jpn.
