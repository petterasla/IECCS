Simulations of cool, warm, and intermediate years were rerun with meteorology from four general circulation models with a doubling of CO2. In all simulations with doubled CO2 there is an earlier onset of stratification, increased summer epilimnetic temperature (1-7°C), and an increased intensity and longer duration of stratification. Maximum surface temperatures at times may exceed upper lethal limits of warm and cool water fish in some scenarios. Suitable thermal habitat for cold water, cool water, and warm water fish generally increases in all scenarios after climate change. Changes in the vertical migration of Daphnia, however, are expected to vary depending on the interaction of thermal stratification and fish habitat use. In northern Wisconsin lakes with cold water planktivores, habitat overlap between fish and zooplankton is expected to decrease, while in southern Wisconsin lakes habitat overlap is expected to increase. Although most physical responses of lakes to climate change are consistent among all climate scenarios, biological responses will likely be more variable owing to the complex nature of factors determining ecological interactions in lakes.",,,,,,,,"Boer, G.J., Mcfarlane, N.A., Lazare, M., Greenhouse gas-induced climate change simulated with the CCC second generation general circulation model (1992) J.
