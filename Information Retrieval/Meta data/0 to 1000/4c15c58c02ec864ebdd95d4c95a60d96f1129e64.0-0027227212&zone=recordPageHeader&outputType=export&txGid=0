Emission factors (g of C/MJ) need to include greenhouse gas emissions and energy losses throughout the fuel cycle in order to compare the fuels. Nevertheless, CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas from coal. Emission factors have decreased due to improved efficiency of coal use. The scope for further improvements in efficiency of conventional and advanced power generation is assessed. Control of CO2 emissions is viewed as a less promising option owing to the high cost and energy penalty of most methods. It is concluded that there is no firm basis for evaluating the effect of reducing emissions on their global warming potential. However, it is desirable that available technologies be implemented to reduce emissions by improved efficiency.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Energy dissipation; Gas emissions; Power generation; Coal utilization; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse effect",,,,,,,"Smith, I.M.; IEA Coal Research, London, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,08870624,,ENFUE,,"English","Energy Fuels",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027227212
