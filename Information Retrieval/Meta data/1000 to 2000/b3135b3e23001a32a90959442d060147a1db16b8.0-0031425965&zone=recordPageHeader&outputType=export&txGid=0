Ambient and elevated (+ 4°C) temperature regimes were attained consistently and reliably throughout the growing season, with high reproducibility between chambers. From May through December the average of nearly 300,000 temperature measurements was 18.5°C in ambient air, 18.9 ± 0.6°C in six ambient chambers, and 22.4 ± 0.9°C in six elevated temperature chambers. The difference in soil temperature between ambient and elevated chambers was 1.2°C. Absolute humidity (vapour pressure) in the chambers was higher than that of ambient air, but it was generally similar between temperature treatments. Vapour pressure deficit therefore was higher in elevated temperature chambers than in ambient chambers, and this difference is considered an inseparable part of the temperature treatment. The addition of a temperature control system to open-top chambers removes what has been an important flaw in this important tool for global change research. © 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd.","Acer sp; Air temperature; Elevated CO2; Exposure methods; Field experiments; Global warming","carbon dioxide enrichment; ecophysiology; temperature",,,,,,"Ashenden, T.W., Baxter, R., Rafarel, C.R., An inexpensive system for exposing plants in the field to elevated concentrations of CO2 (1992) Plant, Cell, and Environment, 15, pp. 365-372; Bassow, S.L., McConnaughay, K.D.M., Bazzaz, F.A., The response of temperate tree seedlings grown in elevated CO2 to extreme temperature events (1994) Ecological Applications, 4, pp. 593-603; Dickinson, R.E., Meleshko, V., Randall, D., Sarachik, E., Silva-Dias, P., Slingo, A., Climate processes (1996) Climate Change 1995: the Science of Climate Change, pp. 193-227. , Contribution of Working Group I to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (eds Houghton JT, Meira Filho LG, Callander BA, Harris N, Kattenberg A, Maskell K), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Drake, B.G., Peresta, G.J., Open top chambers for studies of the long-term effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on wetland and forest ecosystem processes (1993) Design and Execution of Experiments on CO2 Enrichment, pp. 273-289. , (eds Schulze E-D, Mooney HA), Rep. no. 6, Environmental Research Programme, Commission of the European Communities.
