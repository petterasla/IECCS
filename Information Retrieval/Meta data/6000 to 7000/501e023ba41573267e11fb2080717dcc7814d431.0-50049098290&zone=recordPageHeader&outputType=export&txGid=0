Estimates of megafauna biomass (including humans as a megafauna species) for before, during, and after the extinction episode suggest that growth of human biomass largely matched the loss of non-human megafauna biomass until ≈12,000 years ago. Then, total megafauna biomass crashed, because many non-human megafauna species suddenly disappeared, whereas human biomass continued to rise. After the crash, the global ecosystem gradually recovered into a new state where megafauna biomass was concentrated around one species, humans, instead of being distributed across many species. Precrash biomass levels were finally reached just before the Industrial Revolution began, then skyrocketed above the precrash baseline as humans augmented the energy available to the global ecosystem by mining fossil fuels. Implications include (i) an increase in human biomass (with attendant hunting and other impacts) intersected with climate change to cause the Quaternary Megafauna Extinction and an ecological threshold event, after which humans became dominant in the global ecosystem; (ii) with continued growth of human biomass and today's unprecedented global warming, only extraordinary and stepped-up conservation efforts will prevent a new round of extinctions in most body-size and taxonomic spectra; and (iii) a near-future biomass crash that will unfavorably impact humans and their domesticates and other species is unavoidable unless alternative energy sources are developed to replace dwindling supplies of fossil fuels. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Ecological threshold; Mammal; Paleoecology; Pleistocene","animal hunting; biomass distribution; biomass production; conference paper; controlled study; fossil; mammal; nonhuman; priority journal; species extinction; animal; article; biomass; ecology; human; species difference; Mammalia; Animals; Biomass; Ecology; Extinction, Biological; Humans; Species Specificity",,,,,,"Alroy, J., A multispecies overkill simulation of the end-Pleistocene megafaunal mass extinction (2001) Science, 292, pp. 1893-1896; Barnosky, A.D., Koch, P.L., Feranec, R.S., Wing, S.L., Shabel, A.B., Assessing the causes of Late Pleistocene extinctions on the continents (2004) Science, 306, pp. 70-75; Grayson, D.K., Meltzer, D.J., A requiem for North American overkill (2003) J Archaeol Sci, 30, pp. 585-593; Koch, P.L., Barnosky, A.D., Late Quaternary extinctions: State of the debate (2006) Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst, 37, pp. 215-250; (1999) Extinctions in Near Time: Causes, Contexts, and Consequences, , MacPhee RDE, ed , Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York; Martin, P.S., Pleistocene overkill (1967) Nat Hist, 76, pp. 32-38; (1984) Quaternary Extinctions: A Prehistoric Revolution, , Martin PS, Klein RG, eds , University of Arizona Press, Tucson; Pleistocene Extinctions: The Search for a Cause (1967) Proceedings of the VII Congress of the International Association for Quaternary Research, 6. , Martin PS, Wright HE, Jr, eds , Yale Univ Press, New Haven, CT; Trueman, C.N.G., Field, J.H., Dortch, J., Charles, B., Wroe, S., Prolonged coexistence of humans and megafauna in Pleistocene Australia (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 8381-8385; Wroe, S., Field, J., A review of the evidence for a human role in the extinction of Australian megafauna and an alternative interpretation (2006) Q Sci Rev, 25, pp. 2692-2703; Roberts, R.G., New ages for the last Australian megafauna: Continent-wide extinction ≈46,000 years ago (2001) Science, 292, pp. 1888-1892; Firestone, R.B., Evidence for an extraterrestrial impact 12,900 years ago that contributed to the megafaunal extinctions and the Younger Dryas cooling (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 16016-16021; Maurer, B.A., Relating human population growth to the loss of biodiversity (1996) Biodivers Lett, 3, pp. 1-5; Vitousek, P.M., Ehrlich, P.R., Ehrlich, A.H., Matson, P.A., Human appropriation of the products of photosynthesis (1986) Bioscience, 36, pp. 368-373; Vitousek, P.M., Mooney, H.A., Lubchenco, J., Melillo, J.M., Human domination of earth's ecosystems (1997) Science, 277, pp. 494-499; McDaniel, C.N., Borton, D.N., Increased human energy use causes biological diversity loss and undermines prospects for sustainability (2002) Bioscience, 52, pp. 929-936; Lyons, S.K., Smith, F.A., Brown, J.H., Of mice, mastodons, and men: Human mediated extinctions on four continents (2004) Evol Ecol Res, 6, pp. 339-358; Guthrie, R.D., Radiocarbon evidence of mid-Holocene mammoths stranded on an Alaskan Bering Sea island (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 746-749; Stuart, A.J., Kosintsev, P.A., Higham, T.F.G., Lister, A.M., Pleistocene to Holocene extinction dynamics in giant deer and woolly mammoth (2004) Nature, 431, pp. 684-690; Waters, M.R., Stafford, T.W., Redefining the age of clovis: Implications for the peopling of the Americas (2007) Science, 315, pp. 1122-1126; Hubbe, A., Hubbe, M., Neves, W., Early Holocene survival of megafauna in South America (2007) J Biogeogr, 34, pp. 1642-1646; Hern, W.M., How many times has the human population doubled?
