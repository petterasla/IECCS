Regions where the majority of runoff consists of snowmelt are very sensitive to climate change. It is significant to express the relationship between climate change and snow hydrology and it is imperative to performclimate change impact studies on snow hydrology at global and regional scales. Climate change impacts on the mountainous Upper Euphrates Basin were investigated in this paper. First, historical data trend analysis of significant hydrometeorological data is presented. Available future climate data are then explained, and, finally, future climate data are used in hydrological models, which are calibrated and validated using historical hydro-meteorological data, and future streamflow is projected for the period 2070-2100. The hydrological model outcomes indicate substantial runoff decreases in summer and spring season runoff, which will have significant consequences on water sectors in the Euphrates Basin. © 2011 IAHS Press.","Climate change; Hydrological modelling; Snowmelt runoff","Climate change impact; Euphrates; Future climate; Historical data; Hydrological cycles; Hydrological modelling; Hydrological models; Hydrometeorological data; Impact study; Regional scale; Snow hydrology; Snowmelt; Snowmelt runoff; Spring season; Water sector; Global warming; Hydrology; Meteorology; Runoff; Snow; Snow melting systems; Water resources; Water supply; Climate models; climate change; climate effect; hydrological modeling; hydrometeorology; runoff; snowmelt; streamflow; trend analysis; Euphrates Basin",,,,,,"Abdo, K.S., Assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrology of Gilgel Abay catchment in Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia (2009) Hydrological Processes, 23 (26), pp. 3661-3669; Adam, J.C., Hamlet, A.F., Lettenmaier, D.P., Implications of global climate change for snowmelt hydrology in the twentyfirst century (2009) Hydrological Processes, 23 (7), pp. 962-972; Barnet, T.P., Adam, J.C., Lettenmaier, D.P., Potential impacts of a warming climate on water availability in snowdominated regions (2005) Nature, 438, pp. 303-309; Bates, B.C., Kundzewicz, Z.W., Wu, S., Palutikof, J.P., (2008) Climate change and water, , eds., Geneva: IPCC Secretariat, Technical Paper of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Beldring, S., Engen-Skaugen, T., Forland, E.J., Roald, L.A., Climate change impacts on hydrological processes in Norway based on two methods for transferring regional climate model results to meteorological station sites (2008) Tellus, 60 (3), pp. 439-450; Bergström, S., Climate change impacts on runoff in Sweden-assessments by global climate models, dynamical downscaling and hydrological modelling (2001) Climate Research, 16, pp. 101-112; Cayan, D.R., Overview of the California climate change scenarios project (2007) Climate Change, 72 (1), pp. 1-6; Croft, B., Aerosol size-dependent below-cloud scavenging by rain and snow in the ECHAM5-HAM (2009) Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 9, pp. 4653-4675; Croley, T.E., Quinn, F.H., Kunkel, K.E., Changnon, S.J., Great Lakes hydrology under transposed climates (1998) Climatic Change, 38, pp. 405-433; Croley, T.E., He, C., Distributed-parameter large basin runoff model I: Model development (2005) Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, 10 (3), pp. 173-181; Dai, A., Precipitation characteristics in eighteen coupled climate models (2006) Journal of Climate, 19, pp. 4605-4630; Demir, I., Kilic, G., Coskun, M., Sumer, U.M., (2008) Türkiye'de Maksimum, Minimum ve Ortalama Hava Si{dotless}cakli{dotless}klari{dotless} ile Yagi{dotless}s Dizilerinde Gözlenen Degisiklikler ve Egilimler (Changes and trends in maximum, minimum, average temperatures and precipitation in Turkey, in Turkish), , TMMOB Iklim Degisimi Symposium, 13-14 March 2008, Ankara; Fowler, H.J., Ekstrom, M., Kilsby, C.G., Jones, P.D., New estimates of future changes in extreme rainfall across the UK using regional climate model integrations. 1.
