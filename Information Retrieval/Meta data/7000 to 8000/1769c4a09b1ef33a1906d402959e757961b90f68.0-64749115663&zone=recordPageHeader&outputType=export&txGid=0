It is difficult to decompose these gases due to their tetrahedral structure arising from strong C-F bonds. This paper discussed C2F6 (one of PFCs gases) thermal decomposition characteristic under 950-1100 °C in a laboratory scale reactor. The effects of C2F6 initial concentration, reaction temperature, residence time on C2F6 decomposition ratio were also investigated. The experimental results indicate that the lower initial C2F6 concentration, higher reaction temperature, longer residence time can promote C2F6 decomposition ratio. On the basis of the results, it can be drawn that the reaction order of C2F6 thermal decomposition is between 0 and 1. Above 90% C2F6 decomposition ratio can be achieved under a temperature of 1100 °C, 223.21 μmol/L initial C2F6 concentration and 2 s residence time. Basis on the calculation, the activation energy(Ea) and the frequency factor(A) of C2F6 thermal decomposition in the temperature range of 950-1100 °C were 313.2 kJ/mol and 8.8×1011 s-1, respectively.","C2F6; Characteristic; Thermal decomposition",,,,,,,"Laurie, S.B., (2005) Reduction of Perfluorocompound(PFC) Emissions, , International Sematech Manufacturing Initiative; Urashima, K., Kostov, K.G., Okayasu, Y., (2001) IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 37 (5), pp. 1456-1463; Xu, S.-C., (1993) Organic Chemistry, Second Ed., pp. 7-9. , Beijing: Higher Education Press; Takayuki, W., Taira, T., (2008) Thin Solid Films, 516, pp. 4391-4396; Zeng, N.-F., Steam plasma torch equipment in treating the waste gases of semiconductor etching processes (2005), Taiwan: National Central UniversityTakaki, K., Urashima, K., Chang, J.S., (2006) Thin Solid Films, 506-507, pp. 414-417; Urashima, K., Kostov, K.G., Chang, J.S., (1999) IEEE-IAS Annual Meeting, 2, pp. 1136-1143; Zhang, L., Xu, Z.-M., Yuan, X.-Q., (2007) Chemical Reaction Engineering, Second Edition, pp. 66-69. , Shanghai: East China University of Science and Technology Press; Zhao, X.-L., Ji, Y.-M., Li, J.-Y., (2008) Chem.
