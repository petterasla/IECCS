The decadal change of tropical cyclones activities are closely related to the decadal changes of atmospheric general circulation in the troposphere, which provide favorable or unfavorable conditions for the formation of tropical cyclone. Furthermore, based on the simulation of corresponding atmospheric general circulation from a coupled climate model under the schemes of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on emission scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 emissions scenarios an outlook on the tropical cyclone frequency generated over the western North Pacific in the coming half century is presented. It is indicated that in response to the global climate change the general circulation of atmosphere would become unfavorable for the formation of tropical cyclone as a whole and the frequency of tropical cyclones formation would likely decrease by 5% within the next half century, although more tropical cyclones would appear during a short period in it.","Frequency of tropical cyclone; General circulation anomaly; IPCC SRES A2 and B2","atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; decadal variation; global climate; temperature anomaly; tropical cyclone; twentieth century; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",,,,,,"Bengtsson, L., Botzet, M., Esch, M., Will greenhouse gas induced warming over the 50 years lead to higher hurricane and greater intensity of hurricanes?
