A suite of gasification was achieved to decrease tar, sulfur and dust during gasification process. The developing system provides a feasible strategy for improving and developing gasifier equipment. The improved gasifier equipment includes gas generator, high temperature pyrolysis apparatus, the first dust filter, the second dust filter, heat-cold exchange apparatus, washing apparatus, motive power apparatus, tar removal apparatus, and sulfur removal apparatus. The harmless combustible gases enter the gas container, and go through a dedicated pipeline, and then the gas was delivered to the house for coking, heating or generating electricity. Up to now, the improved gasifier equipment has been successfully applied to some communities in Qinghai and inner Mongolia of China. Implications of the improved gasifier equipment is improving human health, reducing fuel consumption, deforestation and global climate change. It was found cost-effective and renewable in nature and suitable for both urban and rural areas, especially in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau because of the anoxia. The study has applied the patent of the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China (Patent number: 201020192115.2). The product has produced by Lanzhou MinSheng straw liquefied gas stove Co., LTD, Gansu, China. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Biomass gasification; Gasifier equipment; Improved design; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Renewable energy",,,,,,,"Berndes, G., Hoogwijk, M., van den Broek, R., The contribution of biomass in the future global energy supply: A review of17 studies (2003) Biomass Bioenergy, 25, pp. 1-28; Bhargava, A., Khanna, R.N., Bhargava, S.K., Kumar, S., Exposure risk to carcinogenic PAHs in indoor-air during biomass combustion whilst cooking in rural India (2004) Atmos Environ, 38 (28), pp. 4761-4767. , doi:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2004.05.012; Bhattacharya, S.C., Salam, P.A., Low greenhouse gas biomass options for cooking in the developing countries (2002) Biomass Bioenergy, 22 (4), pp. 305-317; Dai, L., The development and prospective of bioenergy technology in China (1998) Biomass and Bioenergy, 5, pp. 181-186; Díaz, E., Smith-Sivertsen, T., Pope, D., Lie, R.T., Diaz, A., McCracken, J., Eye discomfort, headache and back pain among Mayan Guatemalan women taking part in a randomised stove intervention trial (2007) J Epidemiol Community Health, 61 (1), pp. 74-79. , doi:10.1136/jech.2006.043133; Ekici, A., Ekici, M., Kurtipek, E., Akin, A., Arslan, M., Kara, T., Obstructive airway diseases in women exposed to biomass smoke (2005) Environ.
