Moreover, understanding and characterizing patterns of Antarctic biodiversity has taken on a degree of urgency because of potential impacts of global warming. To expand an understanding of the evolutionary history of Antarctic marine invertebrates, the genetic diversity of the crinoid Promachocrinus kerguelensis Carpenter, 1888 was investigated, which is documented to have a circumpolar distribution extending to subantarctic islands. Specimens of P. kerguelensis were collected from the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula, and the subantarctic islands South Georgia, South Sandwich and Bouvetøya Island from 2001 to 2004. P. kerguelensis was previously subject to morphological review that confirmed the taxonomic recognition of only one species. The wide distribution and reported high dispersal capability for P. kerguelensis predicts one large panmictic population. In contrast, nucleotide sequence data from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b genes, collected herein, reveal distinct genetic structure and cryptic speciation within P. kerguelensis. In the Antarctic Atlantic sector alone, there were at least five ""species- level"" clades. Some of these clades are geographically limited, and most exist in sympatry. The largest and most widespread of these clades was examined to help elucidate connectivity along the subantarctic islands of the Scotia Arc and the Antarctic Peninsula. Within this clade, most genetic diversity was contained within populations, but significant differences were present between regions (Antarctic Peninsula, South Sandwich Is., South Georgia, Bouvetøya Is.), suggesting a corresponding lack of gene flow. Given that P. ""kerguelensis"" is a well-studied taxon, the finding of considerable genetic diversity within the Atlantic sector alone suggests that the recognized diversity of Antarctica's benthic marine life may be underestimated, and will rise dramatically with phylogeographic analyses of putative widespread species. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",,"biodiversity; cladistics; cytochrome; echinoderm; gene; genetic structure; global warming; marine environment; mitochondrion; morphology; phylogeography; sympatry; taxonomy; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Atlantic Sector; Southern Ocean; West Antarctica; Crinoidea; Invertebrata",,,,,,"Allcock, A.L., Brierley, A.S., Thorpe, J.P., Rodhouse, P.G., Restricted gene flow and evolutionary divergence between geographically separated populations of the Antarctic octopus Pareledone turqueti (1997) Mar Biol, 129, pp. 97-102; Arntz, W.E., Rios, C., Magellan-Antarctic: Ecosystems that drifted apart (1999) Sci Mar, 63, pp. 1-518. , Suppl 1; Arntz, W.E., Gutt, J., Klages, M., Battaglia, B., Valencia, J., Walton, D.W.H., Antarctic marine biodiversity: An overview (1997) Antarctic Communities: Species, Structure and Survival, pp. 3-14. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Arntz, W.E., Thatje, S., Linse, K., Avila, C., Ballesteros, M., Barnes, D.K.A., Cope, T., Teixidó, N., Missing link in the Southern Ocean: Sampling the marine benthic fauna of remote Bouvet Island (2006) Polar Biol, 29, pp. 83-96; Avise, J.C., Neigel, J.E., Arnold, J., Demographic influences on mitochondrial DNA lineage survivorship in animal populations (1984) J Mol Evol, 20, pp. 99-105; Barnes, D.K.A., A most isolated benthos: Coastal bryozoans of Bouvet Island (2006) Polar Biol, 29, pp. 114-119; Barnes, D.K.A., Hodgson, D.A., Convey, P., Allen, C.S., Clark, A., Incursion and excursion of Antarctic biota: Past, present and future (2006) Glob Ecol Biogeogr, 15, pp. 121-142; Beaumont, A.R., Wei, J.H.C., Morphological and genetic variation in the Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna (Strebel, 1908) (1991) J Mollus Stud, 57, pp. 443-450; Brandt, A., Evolution of Antarctic biodiversity in the context of the past: The importance of the Southern Ocean deep sea (2005) Antarct Sci, 17, pp. 509-521; Canals, M., Urgeles, R., Calafat, A.M., Deep sea-floor evidence of past ice streams off the Antarctic Peninsula (2000) Geology, 28, pp. 31-34; Chen, L., Devries, A.L., C-Hc, C., Evolution of antifreeze glycoprotein gene from a trypsinogen gene in Antarctic notothenioid fish (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 94, pp. 3811-3816; Clark, A., Kerry, K.R., Hempel, G., Temperature and evolution.
