We show that carbon sinks should be utilized as early as possible, and carbon flow into sinks should last until the atmospheric carbon concentration is stabilized. We rule out any cyclical patterns of carbon sequestration and release. We propose and assess three mechanisms to efficiently introduce sequestration into a carbon permit trading market: a pay-as-you-go system, a variable-length-contract system and a carbon annuity account system. Although the three mechanisms may not be equally feasible to implement, they are all efficient.","Carbon sequestration; Global warming","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; emissions trading",,,,,,"Antle, J.M., Mooney, S., Economics and policy design for carbon sequestration in agriculture (1999) Research Discussion Paper No. 36, , October; Antle, J.M., Capalbo, S.M., Mooney, S., Elliot, E., Paustian, K., Economics of agricultural soil carbon sequestration in the Northern plains (2000) Research Discussion Paper No. 38, , October 1999, Revised March; Boscolo, M., Buongiorno, J., Panayotou, T., Simulation options for carbon sequestration through improved management of a lowland tropical rainforest (1997) Environ.
