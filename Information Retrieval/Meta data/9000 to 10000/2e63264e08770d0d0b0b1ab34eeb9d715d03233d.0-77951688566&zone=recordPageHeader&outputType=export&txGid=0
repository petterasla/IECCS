Using datasets from the literature and field measurements, we investigated loss of SOC and emissions of CH4 and N2O due to marshland conversion in northeast China. Analysis of the documented crop cultivation area indicated that 2.91Mha of marshland were converted to cropland over the period 1950-2000. Marshland conversion resulted in SOC loss of ~240 Tg and introduced ~1.4TgCH4 and ~ 138GgN2O emissions in the cropland, while CH4 emissions reduced greatly in the marshland, cumulatively ~28Tg over the 50 years. Taking into account the loss of SOC and emissions of CH4 and N2O, the global warming potential (GWP) at a 20-year time horizon was estimated to be ~180TgCO2_eq. yr-1 in the 1950s and ~120 TgCO2_eq. yr-1 in the 1990s, with a ~33% reduction. When calculated at 100-year time horizon, the GWP was ~73 TgCO2 _eq. yr-1 in the 1950s and ~58TgCO2_eq. yr-1 in the 1990s, with a ~21% reduction. It was concluded that marshland conversion to cropland in northeast China reduced the greenhouse effect as far as GWP is concerned. This reduction was attributed to a substantial decrease in CH4 emissions from the marshland. An extended inference is that the declining growth rate of atmospheric CH4 since the 1980s might be related to global loss of wetlands, but this connection needs to be confirmed. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cropland; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas; Northeast china; Soil organic carbon; Wetland conversion","agricultural land; emission inventory; global warming; greenhouse effect; growth rate; land use change; marsh; methane; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil emission; China",,,,,,"Batjes, N.H., Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world (1996) European Journal of Soil Science, 47, pp. 151-163; Bergkamp, G., Orlando, B., (1999) Wetlands and Climate Change: Exploring Collaboration Between the Convention on Wetlands and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, , October 1999, The World Conservation Union, Gland, Switzerland; Bousquet, P., Ciais, P., Miller, J.B., Contribution of anthropogenic and natural sources to atmospheric methane variability (2006) Nature, 443, pp. 439-443; Bridgham, A.D., Megonigal, J.P., Keller, J.K., Bliss, N.B., Trettin, C., The carbon balance of North American wetlands (2006) Wetlands, 26, pp. 889-916; Cao, M.K., Marshall, S., Gregson, K., Global carbon exchange and methane emissions from natural wetlands: application of a process-based model (1996) Journal of Geophysical Research, 101 (D9), pp. 14399-14414; Chen, G.Q., (1996) Study on Wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain, pp. 52-59. , Science Press, Beijing, China (in Chinese); Chi, G.Y., Wang, J., Chen, X., Shi, Y., Dynamic changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) of different land use types in Sanjiang Plain (2006) Soils, 38, pp. 755-761. , (in Chinese with English abstract); Cui, B.S., CH4 emission from wetland in Sanjiang Plain (1997) Scientia Geographica Sinica, 17, pp. 93-95. , (in Chinese); Dahl, T.E., (2000) Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Conterminous United States 1986 to 1997, , U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC; Dahl, T.E., (2006) Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Conterminous United States 1998 to 2004, , US Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC; Dahl, T.E., Johnson, C.E., (1991) Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Conterminous United States, mid-1970s to mid-1980s, , US Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC; Ding, W.X., Cai, Z.C., Tsurutab, H., Li, X.P., Effect of standing water depth on methane emissions from freshwater marshes in northeast China (2002) Atmospheric Environment, 36, pp. 5149-5157; Ding, W.X., Cai, Z.C., Wang, D.X., Preliminary budget of methane emissions from natural wetlands in China (2004) Atmospheric Environment, 38, pp. 751-759; (2007) China's National Assessment Report on Climate Change (in Chinese), , Editorial Committee of China's National Assessment Report on Climate Change.
