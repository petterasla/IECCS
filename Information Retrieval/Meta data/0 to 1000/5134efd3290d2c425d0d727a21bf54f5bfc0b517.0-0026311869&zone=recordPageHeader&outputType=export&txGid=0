It is shown that despite the large values of linear cross-correlation between the data records, the long-term trends are significantly different according to the bootstrapping procedure. The confidence of relying on any particular data set for assessing global climate change statistics is thus questioned. -Authors",,"bootstrapping procedure; climate dataset; long term trend; temperature record",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026311869
