Further, intraspecifc variation in Hsps, which will influence species-level response to global warming, has rarely been examined in naturally occurring plants. To understand intraspecific variation in plant Hsps and its relevance to global warming, we examined Hsp content and thermotolerance in five naturally occurring populations of Chenopodium album L. from contrasting thermal environments grown at low and high temperatures. As expected, Hsp accumulation varied between populations, but this was related more to habitat variability than to mean temperature. Unexpectedly, Hsp accumulation decreased with increasing variability of habitat temperatures. Hsp accumulation also decreased with increased experimental growth temperatures. Physiological thermotolerance was partitioned into basal and induced components. As with Hsps, induced thermotolerance decreased with increasing temperature variability. Thus, populations native to the more stressful habitats, or grown at higher temperatures, had lower Hsp levels and induced thermotolerance, suggesting a greater reliance on basal mechanisms for thermotolerance. These results suggest that future global climate change will differentially impact ecotypes within species, possibly by selecting for increased basal versus inducible thermotolerance. © 2008 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Acclimation; Photosynthesis; Stress proteins; Temperature","heat shock protein; acclimation; basal temperature; climate change; climate effect; enzyme activity; photosynthesis; plant; protein; stress; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; article; Chenopodium album; gene expression regulation; greenhouse effect; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; temperature; Chenopodium album; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Greenhouse Effect; Heat-Shock Proteins; Photosynthesis; Temperature; Chenopodium album",,"Heat-Shock Proteins",,,,"Al Mouemar, A., Gasquez, J., Environmental conditions and isozyme polymorphism in Chenopodium album L (1983) Weed Res., 23, pp. 141-149; Arai, A., Mitani, H., Naruse, K., Shima, A., Relationship between the induction of proteins in the hsp70 family and thermosensitivity in two species of Oryzias (Pices) (1994) Comp.
