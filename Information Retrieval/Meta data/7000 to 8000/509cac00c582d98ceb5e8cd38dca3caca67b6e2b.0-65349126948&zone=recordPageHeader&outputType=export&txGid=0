It successfully reproduces various dune patterns and the whole development process of a dune field of several square kilometers during several decades. Based on our simulations, we investigate the influence of sand supply, wind velocity, and wind direction to the dune patterns and dune speed in the dune field in quantity. Compared with the existing dune field model, we solve the correspondence problem in length-scale and time-scale between the simulated and the actual formation and evolution of a dune field. Our results on the variations of the dune speed with the dune height and the relation between the thickness of sand supply and the average dune height both agree with the results measured in field in quality and in quantity. Besides, we present the influence of wind velocity and sand diameter to the maximum dune height in a dune field and replay the 'solitary wave'-like behavior of two barchan dunes in a dune field. These results are not only beneficial to understand the dynamical characteristic of a dune field more comprehensively and more clearly, but also meaningful for further prediction of the migration trend of deserts under global climate change and the investigation of the aeolian geomorphology on Mars.","'Solitary wave'-like behavior; Aeolian geomorphology; Aeolian sand dune field; Scale-coupled method",,,,,,,"Schubert, S., Desert dunes set to roam: Climate change will shift sands and destroy desert ecosystems (2005) Nature, pp. 050627-050629. , doi: 10.1038/news; Thomas David, S.G., Knight, M., Wiggs, G.F.S., Remobilization of southern African desert dune systems by twenty-first century global warming (2005) Nature, 435, pp. 1218-1221; Lorenz, R.D., Wall, S., Radebaugh, J., Boubin, G., The sand seas of Titan: Cassini RADAR observations of longitudinal Dunes (2006) Science, 312, pp. 724-727; Andreotti, B., Claudin, P., Douady, S., Selection of dune shapes and velocities Part 1 : Dynamics of sand, wind and barchans (2002) Eur Phys J B, 28, pp. 321-339; Elbelrhiti, H., Claudin, P., Andreotti, B., Field evidence for surface-wave induced instability of sand dunes (2005) Nature, 437, p. 04058; Kroy, K., Sauermann, G., Herrmann, H.J., A minimal model for sand dunes (2002) Phys Rev Lett, 88, p. 054301; Hersen, P., Douady, S., Andreotti, B., Relevant length scales for barchan dunes (2002) Phys Rev Lett, 89, p. 264301; Jackson, P.S., Hunt, J.C.R., Turbulent wind flow over a low hill (1975) Q J Roy Meteor Soc, 101, pp. 929-955; Sauermann, G., Kroy, K., Herrmann, H.J., A continuum saltation model for sand dunes (2001) Phys Rev E, 64, p. 31305; Schwammle, V., Herrmann, H.J., Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 619-620; Nishimori, H., Ouchi, H., Formation of ripple patterns and dunes by wind-blown sand (1993) Phys Rev Lett, 71 (1), pp. 197-200; Werner, B.T., Eolian dunes: Computer simulations and attractor interpretation (1995) Geology, 23, pp. 1107-1110; Momiji, H., Carretero-González, R., Bishop, S.R., Warren, A., Simulation of the effect of wind speed-up in the formation of transverse dune fields (2000) Earth Surf Proc Land, 25, pp. 905-918; Lancaster, N., Variation in wind velocity and sand transport on the windward flanks of desert sand dunes (1985) Sedimentology, 32, pp. 581-593; Nalpanis, P., Hunt, J.C.R., Barrett, C.F., Saltating particles over flat beds (1993) J Fluid Mech, 251, pp. 661-685; Parteli, E.J.R., Schwämmle, V., Herrmann, H.J., Monteiro, L.H.U., Maia, L.P., Profile measurement and simulation of a transverse dune field in the lencois maranhenses (2006) Geomorphology, 81, pp. 29-42; Wasson, R.J., Hyde, R., Factors determining desert dune type (1983) Nature, 304, pp. 337-339; Livingstone, I., Wiggs, G.F.S., Baddock, M., Barchan dunes: Why they cannot be treated as solitons or solitary waves (2005) Earth Surf Proc and Land, 30, pp. 255-257","Zheng, X.-J.; Key Laboratory of Mechanics on Western Disaster and Environment, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China; email: xjzheng@lzu.edu.cn",,,"Freund Publishing House Ltd",,,,,15651339,,,,"English","Int.
