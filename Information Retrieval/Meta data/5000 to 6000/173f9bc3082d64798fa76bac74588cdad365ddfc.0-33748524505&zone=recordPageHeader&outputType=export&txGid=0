[No author name available],"Potential of reducing the environmental impact of aviation by using hydrogen Part III: Optimum cruising altitude and airport implications",2006,"Aeronautical Journal","110","1110",,"553","565",,,,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33748524505&partnerID=40&md5=3f528f0a221182b9a4c8c98e41acee61",,"","The main objective of the paper is to evaluate the potential of reducing the environmental impact of civil subsonic aviation by using hydrogen fuel. The paper is divided into three parts of which this is Part III. In Part I the background, prospects and challenges of introducing an alternative fuel in aviation were outlined. The aero engine design when using hydrogen was covered in Part II. In this paper, Part III, the subjects of optimum cruising altitude and airport implications of introducing liquid hydrogen-fuelled aircraft are raised. For minimum global warming, the results of a preliminary analysis associated with large uncertainties suggest that cryoplanes should cruise at an altitude of about 2-3km below where conventional aircraft cruise today. Ignoring the cost implications, from an airport infrastructure point of view, it seems feasible to change to hydrogen use. With respect to the availability of energy, it would be reasonable to change from kerosene to liquid hydrogen as fuel for all civil aviation refuelling in Sweden.",,"Aircraft; Aircraft fueling; Aircraft models; Airports; Environmental impact; Global warming; Hydrogen fuels; Structural design; Aero engine design; Cryoplanes; Hydrogen-fuelled aircraft; Liquid hydrogen; Civil aviation",,,,,,"Rogers, H.L., Lee, D.S., Raper, D.W., Foster, P.M.D.F., Wilson, C.W., Newton, P.J., The impacts of aviation on the atmospherc (2002) Aeronaut J, 106 (1064), pp. 521-546; Schniedur, H., McKay, D., Global energy resources and hydrogen supply costs (2001) Task Final Report 8.4-1, , CRYOPLANE Project; Grkwe, V., Dameris, M., Fichter, C., Lee, D.S., Impact of aircraft NOx emissions.
