Although there have been repeated assertions that climate change will alter the distribution of arboviruses and their vectors, specific examples are lacking in which the role of global warming alone has been unambiguously defined in the spread of such infections. This article summarizes recent events in Europe and the current status of BTV in the Americas and elsewhere in the context of potential global emergence of the BTV infection and disease of ruminants. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
