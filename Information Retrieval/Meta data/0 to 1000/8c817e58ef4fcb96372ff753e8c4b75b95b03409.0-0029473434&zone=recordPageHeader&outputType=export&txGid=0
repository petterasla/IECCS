Illinois has adopted an even broader program by 1) establishing a Global Climate Change Office to foster research and provide information and 2) forming a task force to address a wide array of issues including state input to federal policies such as the Clinton administration's 1993 Climate Change Action Plan and to the research dimensions of the US Global Climate Change Research Program. The Illinois program calls for increased attention to studies of regional impacts, including integrated assessments, and to research addressing means to adapt to future climate change. -from Author",,"climate change; energy conservation; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; regional programme; USA, Illinois",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029473434
