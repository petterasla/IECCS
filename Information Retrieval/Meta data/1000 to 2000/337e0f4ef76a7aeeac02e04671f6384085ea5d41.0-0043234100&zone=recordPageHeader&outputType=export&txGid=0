In particular, in the last 20 years, the maximum yearly temperature is persistently exceeding its mean value for the whole recorded period. In an effort to explain this phenomenon, a study was made on the surface air temperature records for the past three decades measured at Kuwait International Airport and at a nearby coastal station at Ras Al-Khafja. The analyses have demonstrated that the airport weather station is more influenced by urbanization than Ras Al-Khafja. The linear trend of the air temperature data for both stations consistently showed a cooling period until 1972, followed by a warming period with temperature increases in the range of 0.03-0.08°C yr-1. This warming trend is believed to be partly due to global climate change and the rest is due to man-induced local change in climate caused by urbanization. The urban warming appears to be both a daytime and nighttime phenomenon, with maximum, mean and minimum temperatures showing a considerable increase. It is estimated that urban warming accounts for 25% of the maximum temperature increase. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Vinnikov, K.Ya., Current climate changes in the northern hemisphere (1980) Meteor.
