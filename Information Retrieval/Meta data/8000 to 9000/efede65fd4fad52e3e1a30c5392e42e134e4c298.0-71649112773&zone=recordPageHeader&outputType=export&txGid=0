Based on the simulation of methanol synthesis via biomass gasification in interconnected fluidized beds using Aspen Plus software, the method of LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) is applied to evaluate the impact of pollutant emissions in the full life cycles of biomethanol. The integrated performance of biomethanol system is analyzed combining with energy utilization, economic cost, and environmental impact. The results show that the methanol yield can reach 0.308 kg/(kg rice straw), i.e., the energy efficiency of rice straw conversion to biomethanol is approximately 42.7%. For a biomethanol plant with an annual production of 50,000 tons, the real cost of biomethanol is evaluated at 2685 RMB/t, in which the economic cost is 2347 RMB/t, and the environmental cost is 337.6 RMB/t. Because of its high investment cost, presently the economic cost of biomethanol is higher than that of coal-based methanol in China. Nevertheless biomethanol will be becoming more competitive with the shortage of fossil fuel in the future. In the whole life cycle, the main pollutant emissions come from the biomethanol production process and biomethanol end-use by automobiles, whereas the net environmental effect is negative during the rice cultivation. Global warming is the most influential factor of the different impact categories. However, 1910 kg of CO 2 can be fixed for one ton of methanol by photosynthesis in the growth of rice, thus the effect of global warming is significantly reduced by biomass utilization compared with coal-based methanol. The integrated performance indicates that producing methanol from rice straw is beneficial to both the utilization of agriculture waste and in the improvement of environment. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Annual production; Aspen Plus software; Biomass Gasification; Biomass utilization; Economic costs; End-uses; Environmental costs; Environmental effects; Environmental performance; Influential factors; Integrated analysis; Interconnected fluidized bed; Investment costs; Life-cycle assessments; Methanol synthesis; Pollutant emission; Production process; Real costs; Rice cultivation; Rice straws; Biomass; Computer software; Costs; Cultivation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fluidization; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuels; Gasification; Global warming; Investments; Methanol; Photosynthesis; Synthesis gas manufacture; Environmental impact",,,,,,"Goyal, H.B., Seal, D., Saxena, R.C., Bio-fuels from thermochemical conversion of renewable resources: A review (2008) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Rev., 12, pp. 504-517; Zhou, F., Wang, Q., Fifty years of China's energy (2002) China Electricity Press, 434, p. 441. , Beijing, (in Chinese); Sun, X., Status & prospect of biomass gasfication Methanol/ dimethyl ether synthesis system (2007) Sino Global Energy, 12 (4), pp. 29-36; Zabaniotou, A., Ioannidou, O., Skoulou, V., Rapeseed residues utilization for energy and 2nd generation biofuels (2008) Fuel, 87, pp. 1492-1502; Panigrahi, S., Dalai, A.K., Chaudhari, S.T., Bakhshi, N.N., Synthesis gas production from steam gasification of biomass-derived oil (2003) Energy Fuels, 17, pp. 637-642; Lindfeld, E.G., Westermark, M.O., System study of carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture in bio-based motor fuel production (2008) Energy, 33, pp. 352-361; Sunggyu, L., Abhay, S., Liquid phase methanol and dimethyl ether synthesis from syngas (2005) Top.
