The long-term population-level impact of this stress would be lessened in populations able to genetically adapt to higher temperatures. Adaptation requires the presence of genetically-based variation. At-risk populations may undergo strong declines in population size that lower the amount of genetic variation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the heritability of heat tolerance in populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa, and to determine if heritabilities were reduced following a population bottleneck. Heritabilities of heat tolerance were determined for two lines of each of two source populations; two bottlenecked lines (established with one pair of fish) and two regular lines. Heat tolerance was quantified as temperature-at-death (TAD), when fish acclimated at 28°C were subjected to an increase in water temperature of 2°C/day. Mid-parent/mean offspring regressions and full-sib analyses were used to estimate the heritability of TAD. Heritability estimates from parent/offspring regressions ranged from 0.185 to 0.462, while those from sib analyses ranged from 0 to 0.324, with an overall estimate of 0.203 (0.230 for the regular lines, 0.168 for bottlenecked ones). Fish from the bottlenecked line from one source population (but not the other) had a lower heritability than did those from the regular line. These results show that the populations tested had some potential for adaptation to elevated water temperatures, and that this potential may be reduced following a population bottleneck. This should not be construed as evidence that natural populations will not suffer negative consequences from global warming; this study only showed that these specific populations have some potential to adapt under a very specific set of conditions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Climate change; Evolutionary processes; Genetic adaptation; Heat tolerance; Heritability; Population bottleneck","climate change; fish; genetic variation; global warming; heritability; population bottleneck; population size; water temperature; animal experiment; article; climate change; controlled study; Cyprinodontiformes; evolutionary adaptation; genetic variability; greenhouse effect; habitat fragmentation; heat acclimatization; heat stress; heat tolerance; heritability; Heterandria formosa; nonhuman; population size; priority journal; progeny; water temperature; Acclimatization; Animals; Biological Evolution; Cyprinodontiformes; Female; Genetic Variation; Hot Temperature; Male; Selection, Genetic; Stress, Physiological; Heterandria; Heterandria formosa",,,,,,"Baer, C.F., Travis, J., Direct and correlated responses to artificial selection on acute thermal stress tolerance in a livebearing fish (2000) Evolution, 54 (1), pp. 238-244; Beitinger, T.L., Bennett, W.A., McCauley, R.W., Temperature tolerances of North American freshwater fishes exposed to dynamic changes in temperature (2000) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 58 (3), pp. 237-275. , DOI 10.1023/A:1007676325825; Benfey, T.J., McCabe, L.E., Pepin, P., Critical thermal maxima of diploid and triploid brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis (1997) Environ Biol Fish, 49, pp. 259-264; Bryant, E.H., McCommas, S.A., Combs, L.M., The effect of an experimental bottleneck upon quantitative genetic variation in the housefly (1986) Genetics, 114, pp. 1191-1211; Charmantier, A., Garant, D., Environmental quality and evolutionary potential: Lessons from wild populations (2005) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 272 (1571), pp. 1415-1425. , DOI 10.1098/rspb.2005.3117; Charo-Karisa, H., Rezk, M.A., Bovenhuis, H., Komen, H., Heritability of cold tolerance in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, juveniles (2005) Aquaculture, 249 (1-4), pp. 115-123. , DOI 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.04.029, PII S0044848605002449; Chown, S.L., Jumbam, K.R., Sørensen, J.G., Terblanche, J.S., Phenotypic variance, plasticity and heritability estimates of critical thermal limits depend on methodological context (2009) Funct Ecol, 23, pp. 133-140; Crnokrak, P., Roff, D.A., Dominance variance: Associations with selection and fitness (1995) Heredity, 75 (5), pp. 530-540; Elderkin, C.L., Stoeckel, J.A., Klerks, P.L., Berg, D.J., Heritability of heat tolerance in zebra mussel veligers (2004) J Great Lakes Res, 30, pp. 360-366; Elliott, J.M., Some aspects of thermal stress on freshwater teleosts (1981) Stress and Fish, pp. 209-245. , Pickering AD (ed) Academic Press, New York; Emerson, K., Russo, R.C., Lund, R.E., Thurston, R.V., Aqueous ammonia equilibrium calculations: Effect of pH and temperature (1975) J Fish Res Board Can, 32, pp. 2379-2383; Falconer, D.S., Mackay, T.F.C., (1996) Introduction to Quantitative Genetics, , 4th edn.
