Nitrogen isotope fractionation associated with nitrification can be a proxy of nitrifiers' sensitivity to changing temperature. We hypothesized that the temperature-induced balance between the transport of substrate NH4 + into the microbial cell (supply) and the intracellular NH4 + oxidation (consumption) governs the intracellular NH4 + concentration and then affects nitrification rates and associated isotope fractionations. This study was conducted to understand the microbial response of NH4 + oxidation to changing temperatures by examining the effect of changing temperature on nitrification rate and apparent isotope fractionation. Materials and methods: A batch aerobic incubation was conducted with a sandy loam soil over 150 days at three different soil temperatures: 10, 20, and 30°C. After applying ammonium sulfate, we analyzed the temporal variations in the concentrations and the isotopic compositions of soil inorganic N and calculated nitrification rates and isotope fractionation factors. Results and discussion: Net nitrification rate increased with increasing soil temperature, while apparent isotope fractionation factors decreased. The increased net nitrification rate was attributable to both an increase in NH4 + transport across cell membranes and an increase in intracellular enzymatic activity. Meanwhile, the decreased apparent isotope fractionation suggested that NH4 + oxidation rate became faster than NH4 + transport rate, resulting in a decrease in intracellular NH4 + concentrations. Conclusions: Although intracellular NH4 + transport and oxidation were not directly measured in this study, it is concluded that NH4 + oxidation is more sensitive to increasing temperature than NH4 + transport judging from the apparent N isotopic fractionation associated with NH4 + concentration changes (mainly by nitrification) under different temperature regimes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Ammonium transport; Apparent isotope fractionation; Intracellular ammonium concentration; Intracellular enzyme activity; Net nitrification rate; Soil temperature","ammonia; ammonium; enzyme activity; global warming; isotopic composition; isotopic fractionation; nitrification; nitrogen isotope; sandy loam; soil chemistry; soil nitrogen; soil temperature; substrate",,,,,,"Bárcenas-Moreno, G., Gómes-Brandón, M., Rousk, J., Bååth, E., Adaptation of soil microbial communities to temperature: comparison of fungi and bacteria in a laboratory experiment (2009) Glob Change Biol, 15, pp. 2950-2957; Breuer, L., Kiese, R., Butterbach-Bahl, K., Temperature and moisture effects on nitrification rates in tropical rain-forest soils (2002) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 66, pp. 834-844; Buresh, R.J., Patrick, W.H., Nitrate reduction to ammonium in anaerobic soils (1978) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 42, pp. 913-918; Casciotti, K.L., Sigman, D.M., Ward, B.B., Linking diversity and stable isotope fractionation in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (2003) Geomicrobiol J, 20, pp. 335-353; Choi, W.J., Ro, H.M., Differences in isotopic fractionation of nitrogen in water-saturated and unsaturated soils (2003) Soil Biol Biochem, 35, pp. 483-486; Choi, W.J., Ro, H.M., Lee, S.M., Natural 15N abundances of inorganic nitrogen in soil treated with fertilizer and compost under changing soil moisture regimes (2003) Soil Biol Biochem, 35, pp. 1289-1298; Dijkstra, P., Laviolette, C.M., Coyle, J.S., Doucett, R.R., Schwartz, E., Hart, S.C., Hungate, B.A., 15N enrichment as an integrator of the effects of C and N on microbial metabolism and ecosystem function (2008) Ecol Lett, 11, pp. 389-397; Farquhar, G.D., Ehleringer, J.R., Hubick, K.T., Carbon isotope discrimination and photosynthesis (1989) Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol, 40, pp. 503-537; Fiencke, C., Spieck, E., Bock, E., Nitrifying bacteria (2005) Nitrogen Fixation in Agriculture, Forestry, Ecology, and the Environment, pp. 255-276. , D.
