The model used in the study was the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' CGCM3. Two realizations of the present-day (1981- 2000) climate and two realizations of a global warming (2081-2100) simulation were run using scenario A2 from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The algorithm was applied to the four twenty-year periods in order to determine the change in the number and distribution of freezing rain events. The model results indicate that the present-day freezing rain maximum over eastern North America will shift poleward and weaken with the result that freezing rain events will decrease significantly in the eastern United States and the Atlantic Provinces. To the north of the maximum and over central Canada there will be modest increases in freezing rain. When averaged over North America, there will be an overall decrease in freezing rain events with global warming.","Climate change; Freezing rain; Global warming; Natural hazards","algorithm; climate change; climate modeling; climatology; freezing; global warming; natural hazard; precipitation assessment; rainfall; Canada; United States",,,,,,"Baldwin, M., Treadon, R., Contorno, S., Precipitation type pre-diction using a decision tree approach with NMC's mesoscale eta model (1994) Preprints 10 th Conference on Numerical Weather Prediction, pp. 30-31. , Portland, OR: American Meteorological Society; Bourgouin, P., A method to determine precipitation types (2000) Weather and Forecasting, 15 (5), pp. 583-592; Carrière, J.-M., Lainard, C., Bot, C.L.E., Robart, F., A climatolo-gical study of surface freezing precipitation in Europe (2000) Meteorol.
