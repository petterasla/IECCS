These scenarios examined the utilization of nutrients and CO2 from synthetic sources and waste streams as well as the materials used to construct a photobioreactor (PBR). A 0.2-m3 closed PBR of Chlorella vulgaris at 30%-oil content by weight with the productivity of 25g/m2×day was used as a case study. Results of the study show that the utilization of resources from waste streams mainly avoided global warming potential (GWP) and eutrophication impacts. Impacts from the production of material used to construct the PBR dominate total impacts in acidification and ozone depletion categories, even over longer PBR lifetimes; thus, the choice of PBR construction materials is important. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment; Microalgae cultivation; Photobioreactor","Chlorella vulgaris; Comparative life cycle assessment; Construction materials; Global warming potential; Industrial ecology; Industrial symbiosis; Life cycle assessment; Microalgae cultivation; Oil contents; Ozone depletion; Photobiore-actor; Synthetic sources; Waste stream; Algae; Carbon dioxide; Eutrophication; Global warming; Microorganisms; Ozone; Ozone layer; Life cycle; acidification; algal culture; bioreactor; biotechnology; carbon dioxide; comparative study; construction material; eutrophication; global warming; green alga; industrial ecology; life cycle; life cycle analysis; microalga; nutrient use; ozone; productivity; resource use; acidification; article; Chlorella vulgaris; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; ozone depletion; photobioreactor; priority journal; species cultivation; symbiosis; waste; Acids; Chlorella vulgaris; Environment; Eutrophication; Global Warming; Industry; Microalgae; Ozone; Photobioreactors; Smog; Symbiosis; Waste Products; algae; Chlorella vulgaris",,"Acids; Ozone, 10028-15-6; Smog; Waste Products",,,,"(2009), 2010. , ABO Technical Standards Committee.
