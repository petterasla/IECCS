The sedimentary record contains a wealth of information on past global climatic change. From this, we can get a good idea of what past climatic extremes were, and some idea of their underlying causes. If we attempt to simulate the climate of a past time period, we can evaluate the ability of a climate model to represent a climatic state substantially different from the present day. One geologic factor is varied (eg geography or CO2 level) while all others are held constant. In this way, the effect on the climate of changing that one factor can be tested, and insights into the mechanisms of global change are gained. -from Authors",,"climatic change; computer model; palaeoclimate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03150941,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026274158
