To quantify the effects of temperature, season and locality on the vulnerability of P. ochraceus to wasting disease, we conducted surveys and experiments in early and late summer. To test the prediction that a small increase in temperature would result in heightened infection intensities, we housed sea stars at different temperatures in the laboratory and caged sea stars subtidally at 2 depths. Prevalence and infection intensity were always higher in warm temperature treatments and did not differ between the sexes or with increasing size. Disease effects also varied with season and locality. Specimens held in aquaria displayed significantly higher disease prevalence and infection intensity in June versus August. Furthermore, sea stars from a sheltered inlet showed markedly higher prevalence of the disease in late summer, while wave-exposed sites had consistently low disease prevalence. Seasonal changes in reproductive potential, host condition and/or physiological acclimation, as well as differences in environmental regime among localities, may impact the dynamics of wasting disease. These results demonstrate that small increases in temperature could drive mass mortalities of Pisaster due to wasting disease, with vulnerability possibly reaching a peak in spring and in populations from sheltered localities. This is the most northern report of wasting disease in the class Asteroidea on the west coast of North America. © 2009 Inter-Research.","Echinoderm; Global warming; Pisaster ochraceus; Temperature; Wasting disease","acclimation; disease incidence; disease prevalence; disease severity; echinoderm; global warming; keystone species; mass mortality; physiological response; predator; reproductive potential; temperature effect; vulnerability; animal; animal disease; article; body size; female; male; Pacific Ocean; pathology; season; sexual development; starfish; temperature; Animal Diseases; Animals; Body Size; Female; Male; Pacific Ocean; Seasons; Sex Characteristics; Starfish; Temperature; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Vancouver Island; Asterias; Asteroidea; Echinodermata; Pisaster; Pisaster ochraceus",,,,,,"Bruno, J.F., Petes, L.E., Harvell, C.D., Hettinger, A., Nutrient enrichment can increase the severity of coral diseases (2003) Ecol Lett, 6, pp. 1056-1061; Dungan, M.L., Miller, T.E., Thomson, D.A., Catastrophic decline of a top carnivore in the Gulf of California rocky intertidal zone (1982) Science, 216, pp. 989-991; Eckert, G.L., Engle, J.M., Kushner, D.J., Sea star disease and population declines at the Channel Islands (1999) Proc 5th California Island Symp, 5, pp. 390-393; Farmanfarmaian, A., Giese, A.C., Boolootian, R.A., Bennett, J., Annual reproductive cycles in four species of west coast starfishes (1958) J Exp Zool, 138, pp. 355-367; Harley, C.D.G., Tidal dynamics, topographic orientation, and temperature-mediated mass mortalities on rocky shores (2008) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 371, pp. 37-46; Harley, C.D.G., Helmuth, B.S.T., Local- and regional-scale effects of wave exposure, thermal stress, and absolute vs. effective shore level on patterns of intertidal zonation (2003) Limnol Oceanogr, 48, pp. 1498-1508; Harvell, C.D., Kim, K., Burkholder, J.M., Colwell, R.R., Emerging marine diseases - climate links and anthropogenic factors (1999) Science, 285, pp. 1505-1510. , and others; Harvell, C.D., Mitchell, C.E., Ward, J.R., Altizer, S., Dobson, A.P., Ostfeld, R.S., Samuel, M.D., Climate warming and disease risks for terrestrial and marine biota (2002) Science, 296, pp. 2158-2162; Helmuth, B., Harley, C.D.G., Halpin, P.M., O'Donnell, M., Hofman, G.E., Blanchette, C.A., Climate change and latitudinal patterns of intertidal thermal stress (2002) Science, 298, pp. 1015-1017; Helmuth, B.S.T., Hoffman, G., Microhabitats, thermal heterogeneity, and patterns of physiological stress in the rocky intertidal zone (2001) Biol Bull, 201, pp. 374-384; Hughes, T.P., Catastrophes, phase shifts, and large-scale degradation of a Caribbean coral reef (1994) Science, 265, pp. 1547-1551; Kim, K., Harvell, C.D., Kim, P.D., Smith, G.W., Merkel, S.M., Fungal disease resistance of Caribbean sea fan corals (Gorgonia spp) (2000) Mar Biol, 136, pp. 259-267; Kushmaro, A., Rosenberg, E., Fine, M., Haim, Y.B., Loya, Y., Effect of temperature on bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica by Vibrio AK-1 (1998) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 171, pp. 131-137; Leighton, B.J., Boom, J.D.G., Bouland, C., Hartwick, E.B., Smith, M.J., Castration and mortality in Pisaster ochraceus parasitized by Orchitophrya stellarum (Ciliophora) (1991) Dis Aquat Org, 10, pp. 71-73; Lessios, H.A., Mass mortality of Diadema antillarum in the Caribbean: What have we learned?
