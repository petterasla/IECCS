Carbon dioxide, produced from burning of fossil fuels, is the principle greenhouse gas and efforts are being made at international level to reduce its emission through adoption of energy-efficient technologies. The UN Conference on Environment and Development, 1992 made a significant development in this field by initiating the discussion on sustainable development under the Agenda 21. Cost-effective construction technologies can bring down the embodied energy level associated with production of building materials by lowering use of energy-consuming materials. This embodied energy is a crucial factor for sustainable construction practices and effective reduction of the same would contribute in mitigating global warming. The cost-effective construction technologies would emerge as the most acceptable case of sustainable technologies in India both in terms of cost and environment.","Cost-effective construction technologies; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Production of building materials",,,,,,,"(2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis - Summary for Policymakers, p. 5. , IPCC; http://web.worldbank.orgBuildings and Climate Change - Status, Challenges and Opportunities, United Nations Environment Programme, Chapter 2.1, p. 7Corporate Sustainability Report 2003-04, TATA Steel; www.tatasteel.com/ sustainability_05/environmental/ev_09.htmhttp://www.bee-india.nic.in/sidelinks/EC%20Award/eca05/03Cement(2006) Improving kiln efficiency in the brick making industry, p. 50. , UNDP Project Document, Government of Bangladesh; www.chaarana.org/ecofriendlyhouses.html","Sengupta, N.; 15N Nelli Sengupta Sarani, New CMC Building, Kolkata 700 087, India; email: nsg1962@rediffmail.com",,,,,,,,00113891,,CUSCA,,"English","Curr.
