An outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment was used to determine how warming of~4°C would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and ecosystems. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biomass; Body size; Food webs; Global warming; Mass-abundance relationships; Phytoplankton; Size spectra; Zooplankton","abundance; aquatic community; body size; community composition; community structure; freshwater ecosystem; global change; global warming; mesocosm; phytoplankton; taxonomy; zooplankton",,,,,,"Allen, A.P., Brown, J.H., Gillooly, J.F., Global biodiversity, biochemical kinetics, and the energetic-equivalence rule (2002) Science, 297, pp. 1545-1548; Allen, A.P., Gillooly, J.F., Towards an integration of ecological stoichiometry and the metabolic theory of ecology to better understand nutrient cycling (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 369-384; Atkinson, D., Ciotti, B.J., Montagnes, D.J.S., Protists decrease in size linearly with temperature (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B - Biological Sciences, 270, pp. 2605-2611. , ca. 2.5% degrees C-1; Benton, T.G., Solan, M., Travis, J.M.J., Sait, S.M., Microcosm experiments can inform global ecological problems (2007) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 22, pp. 516-521; Berlow, E.L., Dunne, J.A., Martinez, N.D., Stark, P.B., Williams, R.J., Brose, U., Simple prediction of interaction strengths in complex food webs (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 106, pp. 187-191; Blanchard, J.L., Jennings, S., Law, R., Castle, M.D., McCloghrie, P., Rochet, M.J., Benoit, E., How does abundance scale with body size in coupled size-structured food webs?
