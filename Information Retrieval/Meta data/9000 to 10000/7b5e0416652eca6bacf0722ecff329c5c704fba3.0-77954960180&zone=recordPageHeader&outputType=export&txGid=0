Several global surface temperature records since 1850 and records deduced from the orbits of the planets present very similar power spectra. Eleven frequencies with period between 5 and 100 years closely correspond in the two records. Among them, large climate oscillations with peak-to-trough amplitude of about 0.1 and 0.25°C, and periods of about 20 and 60 years, respectively, are synchronized to the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn. Schwabe and Hale solar cycles are also visible in the temperature records. A 9.1-year cycle is synchronized to the Moon's orbital cycles. A phenomenological model based on these astronomical cycles can be used to well reconstruct the temperature oscillations since 1850 and to make partial forecasts for the 21st century. It is found that at least 60% of the global warming observed since 1970 has been induced by the combined effect of the above natural climate oscillations. The partial forecast indicates that climate may stabilize or cool until 2030-2040. Possible physical mechanisms are qualitatively discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenon of collective synchronization of coupled oscillators. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Modeling; Planetary motion; Solar variability","Astronomical origin; Climate change modeling; Climate oscillation; Collective synchronization; Combined effect; Coupled oscillators; Empirical evidence; Global surface temperature; Jupiters; Orbital periods; Phenomenological models; Physical mechanism; Planetary motion; Power-spectra; Solar cycle; Solar variability; Temperature oscillations; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Interplanetary flight; Oscillators (electronic); Synchronization; Electric load forecasting",,,,,,"Agnihotri, R., Dutta, K., Bhushan, R., Somayajulu, B.L.K., Evidence for solar forcing on the Indian monsoon during the last millennium (2002) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 198, pp. 521-527; Aslaksen, H., (1999), http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/chinese.shtml, The mathematics of the Chinese calendar.
