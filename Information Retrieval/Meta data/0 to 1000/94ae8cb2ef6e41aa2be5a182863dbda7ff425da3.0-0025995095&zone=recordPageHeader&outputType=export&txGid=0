Fry school of fish physiology developed the concepts of temperature as a lethal, controlling and directive factor: this knowledge is being combined with G.E. Hutchinson's concept of an n-dimentional niche to analyze potential influences of global climate warming on fishes. 2) Behavioral ecology: A.D. Hasler and students formulated and tested the hypothesis of olfactory imprinting as the mechanism by which Pacific salmon ""home' to their natal spawning streams. 3) Population ecology: The realization that reproductive success of fishes depends more on larval mortality than on egg production emerged from the ideas of J. Hjort; inconsistencies between recruitment and reproductive stock size impart uncertainty into fishery management. 4) Community ecology: Species interactions are the grist of community ecology; predation and fishing are a natural for comparative study and application . Also, consumption by fish can control the dynamics of planktonic and benthic animal/plant communities; thus, apparent water quality of lakes depends on the consumer community as well as on nutrient inputs. 5) Ecosystem ecology: D.A. Rawson grouped external, abiotic influences on lakes into climatic, edaphic, and morphometric fators. The morphoedaphic index (Ryder 1965) predicts fish yields from this base, providing fish managers with a useful approximation and ecologists with a conceptual base for synthesis of production processes. 6) Landscape ecology: Regional ecology often incorporates land-water boundaries into the way ecological systems work. Application of island biogeography to lakes, as islands, has allowed predictions of fish assemblages for use by managers. Also, the extent and connectedness of lake and ocean ""landscapes' offer insight into contrasts between marine and freshwater fishery research and management. -from Author",,"fish; fishery",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025995095
