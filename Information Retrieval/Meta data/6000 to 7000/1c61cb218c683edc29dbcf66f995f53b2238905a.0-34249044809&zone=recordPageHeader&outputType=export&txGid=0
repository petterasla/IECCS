We examined changes in macroinvertebrate communities caused by increased temperature (3°C above ambient during summer only and continuous 3°C above ambient all year round), influences of fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) and addition of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in 48 large-scale (3000 l) tanks over a 2 year period. While numbers of Isopoda, Chaoborus, Corixidae, Ephemeroptera, Notonectidae and Odonata were reduced by the presence of fish, nutrient addition caused isopods, corixids, mayflies and odonates to increase in abundance. Impacts of temperature increase were surprisingly low, with only gastropods increasing in heated tanks, suggesting that, overall abundances of most macroinvertebrate taxa will not be severely affected by the predicted temperature rise. To determine if taxa were sampled representatively during the experiment, net sweep samples taken towards the end of the experiment were compared with final macroinvertebrate abundances when the complete contents of each tank were harvested. We found that net sweeping is an appropriate semi-quantitative method for most taxa in mesocosm tanks. However, mites, coleopteran adults and larvae, dipterans and Chaoborus were not adequately sampled. This might explain why we could not detect any treatment effects of temperature, fish or nutrients on mites, coleopterans and dipterans and calls for different sampling techniques for these taxa, especially in ponds with vegetation stands. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Gasterosteus aculeatus; Global climate change; Sampling technique; Sweep net; Temperature","Fish; Global warming; Nutrients; Thermal effects; Water tanks; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Global climate change; Sampling techniques; Warming; Marine biology; abundance; behavioral response; climate change; climate effect; fish; macroinvertebrate; mesocosm; nutrient; predation; sampling; temperature effect; warming; Acari; Chaoborus; Coleoptera; Corixidae; Diptera; Ephemeroptera; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Gastropoda; Isopoda; Notonectidae; Odonata",,,,,,"Atkinson, D., Johnson, I.A., Bennett, A.F., Ectotherm life-history responses to developmental temperature (1996) Animals and Temperature: Phenotypic and Evolutionary Adaptation, pp. 183-204. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Baulch, H.M., Schindler, D.W., Turner, M.A., Findlay, D.L., Paterson, M.J., Effects of warming on benthic communities in a boreal lake: Implications of climate change (2005) Limnology and Oceanography, 50, pp. 1377-1392; Connor, A.O., Bradish, S., Reed, T., Moran, J., Regan, E., Visser, M., Gormally, M., Skeffington, M.S., A comparison of the efficacy of pond-net and box sampling methods in turloughs - Irish ephemeral aquatic systems (2004) Hydrobiologia, 524, pp. 133-144; Costil, K., Daguzan, J., Effect of temperature on reproduction in Planorbarius corneus (L) and Planorbis planorbis (L) throughout the life-span (1995) Malacologia, 36, pp. 79-89; Gurevitch, J., Chester, S.T., Analysis of Repeated Measures Experiments (1986) Ecology, 67, pp. 251-255; Hogg, I.D., Williams, D.D., Response of stream invertebrates to a global-warming thermal regime: An ecosystem-level manipulation (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 395-407; Houghton, J.E.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M., Van Der Linden, P.J., Dai, X., Maskell, K., Johnson, C.A., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge, UK; Humphries, P., Growns, J.E., Serafini, L.G., Hawking, J.H., Chick, A.J., Lake, P.S., Macroinvertebrate sampling methods for lowland Australian rivers (1998) Hydrobiologia, 364, pp. 209-218; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis - Summary for Policymakers, , http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/, IPCC which is available on; Kiffney, P.M., Richardson, J.S., Interactions among nutrients, periphyton, and invertebrate and vertebrate (Ascaphus truei) grazers in experimental channels (2001) Copeia, 2, pp. 422-429; Kozminsky, E.V., Seasonal dynamics of reproduction and reproductive parameters of Bithynia tentaculata (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia) (2003) Zoologichesky Zhurnal, 82, pp. 325-331; Lewis, D.B., Magnuson, J.J., Intraspecific gastropod shell strength variation among north temperate lakes (1999) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 56, pp. 1687-1695; McKee, D., Atkinson, A., Collings, S., Eaton, J., Harvey, I., Hatton, K., Heyes, T., Moss, B., Heated aquatic microcosms for climate change experiments (2000) Freshwater Forum, 14, pp. 51-58; McKee, D., Atkinson, D., The influence of climate change scenarios on populations of the mayfly Cloeon dipterum (2000) Hydrobiologia, 441, pp. 55-62; McKee, D., Atkinson, D., Collings, S., Eaton, J., Harvey, I., Heyes, T., Hatton, K., Moss, B., Macro-zooplankter responses to simulated climate warming in experimental freshwater microcosms (2002) Freshwater Biology, 47, pp. 1557-1570; McKee, D., Hatton, K., Eaton, J.W., Atkinson, D., Atherton, A., Harvey, I., Moss, B., Effects of simulated climate warming on macrophytes in freshwater microcosm communities (2002) Aquatic Botany, 74, pp. 71-83; McKee, D., Atkinson, D., Collings, S.E., Eaton, J.W., Gill, A.B., Harvey, I., Hatton, K., Moss, B., Response of freshwater microcosm communities to nutrients, fish, and elevated temperature during winter and summer (2003) Limnology and Oceanography, 48, pp. 707-722; Merritt, R.W., Cummins, K.W., Resh, V.H., Merritt, R.W., Cummins, K.W., Design of aquatic insect studies: Collecting, sampling and rearing procedures (1996) An Introduction to the Aquatic Insects of North America 3, pp. 12-28. , Kendall/ Hull Publishing Company Iowa; Moss, B., Phillips, G., Madgwick, J., (1996) A Guide to the Restoration of Nutrient-enriched Shallow Lakes, , Broads Authority WW Hawes, UK; Moss, B., McKee, D., Atkinson, D., Collings, S.E., Eaton, J.W., Gill, A.B., Harvey, I., Wilson, D., How important is climate?
