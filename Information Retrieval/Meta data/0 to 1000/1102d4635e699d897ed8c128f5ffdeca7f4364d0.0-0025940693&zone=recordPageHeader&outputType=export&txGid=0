In the light of the 60% cut in emissions recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, transport must find ways of using less fossil fuel. Car fuel economy has considerable short-term potential for saving energy, but requires incentives and regulations. Alternative fuels, if selected carefully, can also reduce greenhouse emissions. But CO2 savings may be outstripped by projected increases in traffic, and restrictions are needed to curb this growth. CO2 abatement measures will be ineffective in isolation, and a succesful strategy will contain a variety of approaches, encompassing both short-and long-term policies. © 1991.","Cars; Global warming; Transport","automobile ownership; carbon dioxide emission; emission control; fuel economy; global warming; passenger transport; transport sector",,,,,,"BBC Television, (1990) Newsnight, , London, UK; Department of Transport, (1989) Roads for Prosperity, , HMSO, London, UK; Warren, How Germany is rising to the carbon challenge (1990) The Guardian; Department of Transport, (1989) National Road Traffic Forecasts (Great Britain), , HMSO, London, UK; Hughes, Potter, (1989) Routes to Stable Prosperity, , Energy and Environment Research Unit, Milton Keynes, UK; Fergusson, Holman, (1990) Atmospheric Emissions from the Use of Transport in the United Kingdom Volume Two: The Effect of Alternative Transport Policies, , World Wildlife Fund, London, UK; Howard, (1990) Energy, Transport and the Environment, , Transnet, London, UK; (1990) Local Transport Today, p. 3. , London; Kemp, Britain's 200 mpg mighty midget (1990) Daily Mail, , London; In many cases these vehicles are fitted with diesel engines, whose efficiency is greater than that of petrol engines. In tests carried out in the UK, a diesel-engined Vauxhall Cavalier has been shown to be up to 22% more economical than an equivalent petrol-engined model: see M. Redsell, G. Lucas and N.

As natural gas consists largely of methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than CO2, this has disturbing implications for overall emissions. Without strict controls on gas leakage, it is plausible that a widespread use of natural gas could contribute more to global warming than a continued use of petroleum fuelsBleviss, Energy for motor vehicles (1990) Scientific American, 263 (3), pp. 102-109; Noise and air pollution from electric vehicles are also very much less than those from internal combustion enginesThe figures are intended to represent the energy consumption of the entire process, including the production and distribution of energyNational Travel Surveys carried out in the UK reveal that in the 10 years to 1985, both personal mileage and time spent travelling increased, whilst the number of journeys remained unchanged at 18/person/week. It appears that trips are becoming longer whilst access to destinations is unchanged, suggesting that much of the growth in traffic volume is unnecessaryDepartment of Transport, op cit, Ref 27London Cycling Campaign, personal communication, November 1990Department of Transport, op cit, Ref 27Sherlock, (1990) Cities Are Good For Us, , Transport 2000, London, UK; Tomkins, Wade, Transport energy in Britain: future trends and carbon dioxide emissions (1990) International Journal of Ambient Energy, 10 (4), pp. 171-193","Hughes, P.; Peter Hughes is at the Energy, Environment Research Unit, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025940693
