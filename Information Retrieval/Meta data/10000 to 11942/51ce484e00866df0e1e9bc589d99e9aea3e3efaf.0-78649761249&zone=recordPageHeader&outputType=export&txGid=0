We explain our observations by interannual fluctuation patterns of air temperature and suggest that lake and river ecosystems in such geographical regions are particularly vulnerable to global warming, as high interannual variability is known to have important ramifications for ecosystem structure and functioning. We estimate that the standard deviation of the duration of ice cover, viewed as a measure of interannual variability, exceeds 25 days for lakes and rivers located on 7% of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere. Such high variability might be an early warning signal for a critical transition from strictly dimictic, ice-covered systems to monomictic, open-water systems. Using the Global Lake and Wetland Database, we suggest that 3.7% of the world's lakes larger than 0.1 km2 are at high risk of becoming open-water systems in the near future, which will have immediate consequences for global biogeochemical cycles. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aquatic ecosystems; Climate change; Lake and river ice; Northern Hemisphere; Variability","air temperature; annual variation; aquatic ecosystem; climate change; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; geographical variation; global warming; ice-dammed lake; Northern Hemisphere; river ice; sensitivity analysis; temperature gradient; vulnerability",,,,,,"Adrian, R., O'Reilly, C.M., Zagarese, H., Lakes as sentinels of climate change (2009) Limnology and Oceanography, 54, pp. 2283-2297; Adrian, R., Walz, N., Hintze, T., Hoeg, S., Rusche, R., Effects of ice duration on plankton succession during spring in a shallow polymictic lake (1999) Freshwater Biology, 41, pp. 621-632; Carpenter, S.R., Brock, W.A., Rising variance (2006) Ecology Letters, 9, pp. 308-315. , a leading indicator of ecological transition; Downing, J.A., Prairie, Y.T., Cole, J.J., The global abundance and size distribution of lakes, ponds, and impoundments (2006) Limnology and Oceanography, 51, pp. 2388-2397; Gerten, D., Adrian, R., Climate-driven changes in spring plankton dynamics and the sensitivity of shallow polymictic lakes to the north Atlantic oscillation (2000) Limnology and Oceanography, 45, pp. 1058-1066; Guttal, V., Jayaprakash, C., Changing skewness (2008) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 450-460. , an early warning signal of regime shifts in ecosystems; Lehner, B., Doll, P., Development and validation of a global database of lakes, reservoirs and wetlands (2004) Journal of Hydrology, 296, pp. 1-22; Leppäranta, M., The Impact of Climate Change on European lakes (2010) Modelling the formation and decay of lake ice, pp. 63-83. , In: (ed.
