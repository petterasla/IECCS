Past usage of SE has been confined to metals. In this paper, this method is extended to account for carbon - a key substance of interest. Accounting for carbon is complicated by the fact that reactions involving this substance are complex and their products are numerous. Through experiments on carbon-containing emissions from styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), natural rubber (polyisoprene, IR), and waste tires we demonstrate that a knowledge of carbon-containing species accounting for 90% (by mass) of gaseous emissions is sufficient. Next, we develop an extended SE calculation methodology and apply it to compare carbon flows through two different systems for municipal solid waste (MSW) management (landfills) and waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities. Our results indicate that while landfills perform better on a cursory analysis, they are roughly equal to WTE when carbon flows related to energy generation are accounted for, and underperform by a factor of 3 when considering global warming potential. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Butadiene; Carbon; Energy conversion; Global warming; Land fill; Life cycle; Management; Refuse disposal; Rubber; Solid wastes; Spontaneous emission; Styrene; Waste disposal; Entropy; Municipal solid waste; Butadiene rubbers; Carbon flows; Energy generations; Global warming potentials; Life cycle analysis; Municipal solid wastes; Natural rubbers; Statistical entropies; Waste management systems; Waste tires; Waste management; Factor analysis; 1,3 butadiene; carbon; isoprene; styrene; benchmarking; carbon; entropy; environmental fate; experimental study; global warming; landfill; life cycle analysis; rubber; waste facility; waste management; article; atmospheric deposition; calculation; chemical reaction; entropy; greenhouse effect; landfill; life cycle; municipal solid waste; pollution transport; thermodynamics; waste management; Carbon; Entropy; Models, Statistical; Waste Management; Carbon containing; Carbon flow; Carbon-containing species; Energy generations; Global warming potential; Life cycle analysis; Statistical entropy; Styrene butadiene rubber; Waste management systems",,"1,3 butadiene, 106-99-0, 25339-57-5; carbon, 7440-44-0; isoprene, 78-79-5; styrene, 100-42-5; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Shannon, C.E., (1948) A Mathematical Theory of Communication; Bell System Technical, 27, pp. 379-423; Rechberger, H., Brunner, P.H., A New, Entropy Based Method To Support Waste and Resource Management Decisions (2002) Environ.
