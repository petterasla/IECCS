Potential changes in the strength of this moisture transport are investigated for two different climate-change scenarios: North Atlantic cooling representative of Heinrich events, and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. The effect of North Atlantic cooling is studied using a coupled regional model with comparatively high resolution that successfully simulates Central American gap winds and other important aspects of the region. Cooler North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) in this model leads to a regional decrease of atmospheric moisture but also to an increase in wind speed across Central America via an anomalous pressure gradient. The latter effect dominates, resulting in a 0.13 Sv (1 Sv = 106m3s-1) increase in overall moisture transport to the Pacific basin. In fresh water forcing simulations with four different general circulation models, the wind speed effect is also present but not strong enough to completely offset the effect of moisture decrease except in one model. The influence of GHG forcing is studied using simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change archive. In these simulations atmospheric moisture increases globally, resulting in an increase of moisture transport by 0.25 Sv from the Atlantic to Pacific. Thus, in both scenarios, moisture transport changes act to stabilize the thermohaline circulation. The notion that the Andes effectively block moisture transport from the Atlantic to the Pacific basin is not supported by the simulations and atmospheric reanalyses examined here. This indicates that such a blocking effect does not exist or else that higher resolution is needed to adequately represent the steep orography of the Andes. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Central America; Central American isthmus; Global warming; Heinrich events; Meridional overturning circulation; Moisture export; Moisture transport; North Atlantic; North Atlantic freshwater flux; Paleoclimate; Thermohaline; Tropical Americas","atmospheric moisture; climate change; cooling; general circulation model; global warming; greenhouse gas; Heinrich event; meridional circulation; moisture transfer; orographic effect; overturn; paleoclimate; pressure gradient; salinity; sea surface temperature; thermohaline circulation; wind velocity; Andes; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Central America; Pacific Ocean",,,,,,"Broecker, W.S., Thermohaline circulation, the Achilles heel of our climate system: Will man-made CO2 upset the current balance?
