Let us analyze some considerations that the authors consider important. The modern evolutionary history of the inland seas was closely related to the global changes in the natural environment: climate, sea level, oceanological characteristics of coastal waters, etc. The greatest changes occurred at the end of the Late Pleistocene and throughout the Holocene periods during the Arctic glacial degradation, the melting of the latest continental glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere, and the formation of modern natural conditions on the earth.",,"climate change; global warming; inland sea; sea level change; Russian Federation",,,,,,"(1976) Geologiya Baltiiskogo Morya (Geology of the Baltic Sea), , Gudelis, V.K. and Emel'yanov, E.M., Eds., Vilnius: Mokslas; Izrael', Yu.A., Pavlov, A.P., Anokhin, Yu.A., Analysis of the present-day and expected in future changes in the climate and cryolithozone in the Northern Regions of Russia (1999) Meteorol.
