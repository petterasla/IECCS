Energy is one of the main sources of economical and social developments. Energy demand is increasing day by day both global and national scale of many countries. Current energy paradigm is based on fossil fuels but fossil energy sources decrease day by day and go through to death point. While this process, fossil sources constitute the main source of green house gas and fast climate change. Today, at this point usage and spread of renewable energy sources is taking place on the agenda of many countries. Wind energy systems have high learning curve value (92%) and when making comparison between wind energy and other renewable energy systems according to cost and efficiency parameter in that reason wind energy systems are more preferable. At the end of the 2008, global installed wind power was reached to 121000 MW and 158 million tones carbon dioxide emission was prevented with this installed power. According to Turkish Met office studies, mean temperature of Turkey has growing trend. Mean temperature of Turkey could be increase between 5 ° C and 6 ° C when comparing between 1961-1990 and 2071-2100 period. Energy production paradigm of Turkey is based on thermal conventional technology. In that reason CO 2 emission level was increased 74.4% between 1990 and 2004 in Turkey. This emission growth is a part of mean temperature increasing problem. Turkey wind energy potential is 47849 MW and nearly 62 million tones carbon dioxide emission could be prevented with this potential. © Sila Science.","Climate change; Global warming; Wind energy; Wind energy regulation in Germany","Carbon dioxide emissions; Conventional technology; Current energy; Efficiency parameters; Emission growth; Emission level; Energy demands; Energy investments; Energy markets; Energy productions; Energy regulation; Fossil energy sources; Fossil sources; Germany; Global trends; Installed power; Learning curves; Mean temperature; Rapid climate change; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy systems; Social development; Turkishs; Wind energy systems; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Commerce; Energy management; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Wind power",,,,,,"Demirbas, A., Future energy sources: Part I (2009) Future Energy Sources, 1, pp. 1-95; Kirtay, E., World's population and energy demand (2009) Soc Politic Econ Cul Res, 1, pp. 145-169; Demirbas, A., Future energy sources: Part II (2009) Future Energy Sources, 1, pp. 151-189; Demirbas, A., Energy concept and energy education (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part B, 1, pp. 85-101; (2007) World Energy Council Turkish National Committee, , Energy and Environment Report, Ankara; Demirbas, A., Economic and environmental impacts of the liquid biofuels (2008) Energy Edu Sci Technol, 22, pp. 37-58; Ucar, A., The environmental impact of optimum insulation thickness for external walls and flat roofs of building in Turkey's different degree-day regions (2009) Energy Edu Sci Technol Part A, 24, pp. 49-69; Demirbas, A., Social, economic, environmental and policy aspects of biofuels (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part B, 1, pp. 75-109; (2008) World Energy Council Turkish National Committee, , Climate Change and Energy Market Report, Ankara; Demirbas, C., The global climate challenge: Recent trends in CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part A, 22, pp. 179-186; Dikmenli, M., Biology students' conceptual structures regarding global warming (2010) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part B, 1, pp. 21-38; Hazar, H., Oner, C., Nursoy, M., Effects of CrN coating of cylinders on engine performance (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part A, 23, pp. 71-85; Kurnaz, M.A., Calik, M., A thematic review of 'energy' teaching studies: Focuses, needs, methods, general knowledge claims and implications (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part B, 1, pp. 1-26; Demirbas, A., Concept of energy conversion in engineering education (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part B, 1, pp. 183-197; Tatli, Z.H., Computer based education: Online learning and teaching facilities (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part B, 1, pp. 172-181; Demirbas, B., Biofuels for internal combustion engines (2009) Energy Edu Sci Technol Part A, 22, pp. 117-132; Kecebas, A., Alkan, M.A., Educational and consciousness-raising movements for renewable energy in Turkey (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part B, 1, pp. 157-170; Yasar, D., Yildiz, D., Küresel Isitilan Dunya ve Su (2009) Truva Yayinlari, Istanbul, pp. 63-70. , (in Turkish); Renewable Energy Sources Lesson Notes (2005) Ege University Solar Energy Institute, , Izmir; (2006) International Energy Agency, , Key world Energy Statistics, Paris; Demir, I., Kilic, G., Coskun, M., Precis Bolgesel Iklim Modeli ile Turkiye Icin Iklim Ongoruleri: HaDaMP3 SRES A2 Senaryosu, IV.
