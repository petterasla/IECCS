Eng., Glasgow University, Glasgow G12 8QQ, United Kingdom","This paper focuses on the status of policy studies on Global Climate Change and how renewable and high-efficiency generation technology can be part of the solution. It considers critical technologies and solutions toward realizing the targets set in the Kyoto treaty. Discussed is energy efficiency in power generation, environmental benefits of high-efficiency gas turbines in competitive energy markets which display less NOx and CO2 emissions per unit of power produced while, providing power generators with the most competitive electricity, and experience in India in mitigating climate change with renewable energy as seen by the UN and an advisor to the Indian government in nonconventional energy sources. Also discussed is stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere that will present dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system as called for under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.","Atmospheric CO2 stabilization; Electric energy efficiency programs; Global climate change; Low NOX gas turbine-based electric power plants; Renewahles and high-efficiency electric power generation",,,,,,,"McConnach, J., Rouse, S., Supply side energy efficiency success at ontario hydro (1998) VI Sepope Conference, , Brazil; Colaco, D., (1998) Report on the Audit of the Losses in the Distribution System in Land of Lakes Utility; Rouse, S., (1998) Supply Side Energy Efficiency: An Effective Way to Reduce Cost and Improve Productivity of Generating Assets, , EPRI Energy Conversion Division, Baltimore; Gururaja, J., Gupta, A., Development of wind energy in India Proceedings of the 1993 Convention of Indian Solar Energy Society; Fischer, H., Wahlen, M., Smith, J., Mastroianni, D., Deck, B., Ice core records of atmospheric CO2 around the last three glacial terminations (1999) Science, 283, pp. 1712-1714; Sarmiento, J.L., Orr, J.C., Siegenthaler, U., A perturbation simulation of CO2 uptake in an ocean general circulation model (1992) J.
