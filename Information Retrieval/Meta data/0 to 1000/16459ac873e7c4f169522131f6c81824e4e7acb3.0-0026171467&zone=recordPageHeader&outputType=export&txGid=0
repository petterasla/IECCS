Exact analytical solutions as they are expected under conditions of global warming trends are given, with the most general case reduced to the solution of an integral equation. The solution of this equation permits to obtain the past trend in the surface temperature by a spatial measurement of the temperature below the earth surface at a fixed time. Analysis of the results may be the best indicator to resolve the controversy whether global warming is real.",,"Heat Transfer--Conduction; Mathematical Techniques--Integral Equations; Nuclear Energy; Global Warming Profiles; Greenland Ice Cap; Thermal Diffusivity; Greenhouse Effect",,,,,,,"Winterberg, F.; Univ of Nevada, Reno, United States",,,,,,,,09323902,,KERNE,,"English","Kerntechnik",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026171467
