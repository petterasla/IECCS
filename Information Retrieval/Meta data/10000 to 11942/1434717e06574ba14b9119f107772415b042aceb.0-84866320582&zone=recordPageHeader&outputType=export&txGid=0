The study focuses on research with Viliui Sakha-native horse and cattle breeders of northeastern Siberia, Russia, who are increasingly challenged by one of global climate change's most prevalent effects: altered water regimes. By applying the theoretical framework of political ecology, the article shows how researchers can better understand how affected peoples have, in this case, ''water in mind'' via their histories, cosmologies, and management practices of water. Such awareness can inform research activities and findings, facilitate effective adaptation, and, ultimately, affect policy. Given the widespread emphasis on adaptation, including the urgent need for, increasing interest in, and funding support for transdisciplinary research projects on adaptation, and the facilitative role researchers and policymakers can play in adaptation, this move to understanding and integrating a population's shifting perceptions-in this case, of water in mind-into research is fundamental. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.",,,,,,,,"Alekseev, N.A., Traditzionnie Religioznie Verovanie Yakutov v XIX-Nachalye XX v (Traditional Religious Belief of the Yakut from the 19th to Beginning of the 20th Century) (1975) Science Publishers, p. 197; Anderson, J., Coauthors, Climate change-induced water stress and its impacts on natural and managed ecosystems (2008) Europäisches Parlament Rep.
