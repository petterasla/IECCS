Our demand for travel, in terms of time, money and mobility, is steadily increasing. This growth has led to a number of undesirable effects, including a substantial contribution to global warming through the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2). To address this issue, a number of solutions are available. Already the technology is established for highly economical cars, but experience shows that incentives or regulations are required in order to stimulate widespread interest in saving fuel. Similarly, alternative fuels can offer considerable reductions in greenhouse emissions, depending on the source of the energy. In the longer run, it is essential that technological measures are complemented by policies to reduce the need to travel, whilst still maintaining accessibility. This paper presents a list of policies that are being investigated as part of a strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from personal travel in Britain.",,"Air Pollution - Control; Automotive Fuels - Research; Carbon Dioxide - Environmental Impact; Greenhouse Effect - Reduction; Motor Transportation - Legislation; Carbon Dioxide Emissions; Global Warming; Personal Travel; Motor Transportation",,,,,,,"Hughes, P.; Open Univ, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,01433369,,IJVDD,,"English","Int J Veh Des",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026438691
