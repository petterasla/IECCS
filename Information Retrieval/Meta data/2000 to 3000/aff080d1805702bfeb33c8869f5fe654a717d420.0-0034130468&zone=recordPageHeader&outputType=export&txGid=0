Intertidal species generally have higher thermal tolerance limits than do subtidal species, and tropical species have higher thermal tolerance limits than do temperate species. The adaptive significance of upper thermal tolerance limits of intertidal organisms, however, has not been examined within a comparative context. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the adaptive significance of upper thermal tolerance limits in 20 congeneric species of porcelain crabs, genus Petrolisthes, from intertidal and subtidal habitats throughout the eastern Pacific. Upper thermal tolerance limits are positively correlated with surface water temperatures and with maximal microhabitat temperatures. Analysis of phylogenetically independent contrasts (from a phylogenetic tree on the basis of the 16s rDNA gene sequence) suggests that upper thermal tolerance limits have evolved in response to maximal microhabitat temperatures. Upper thermal tolerance limits increased during thermal acclimation at elevated temperatures, the amount of increase being greater for subtidal than for intertidal species. This result suggests that the upper thermal tolerance limits of some intertidal species may be near current habitat temperature maxima, and global warming thus may affect the distribution limits of intertidal species to a greater extent than for subtidal species.",,"acclimatization; heat tolerance; marine environment; microhabitat; Pacific Ocean; phylogeny; ribosomal DNA; temperature; acclimation; crab; intertidal environment; latitude; phylogeny; temperature tolerance; Acclimatization; Altitude; Animals; Brachyura; California; Chile; Heat; Linear Models; Mexico; Mortality; Oregon; Pacific Ocean; Panama; Phylogeny; Regression Analysis; Seawater; Temperature; Decapoda (Crustacea); Petrolisthes",,,,,,"Carvacho, A., Los porcelánidos del pacífico americano: Un análisis biogeográfico (Crustacea: Decapoda) (1980) An Cent Cienc Mar Limnol Univ Nac Auton Mex, 7, pp. 249-258; Cavicchi, S., Guerra, D., La Torre, V., Huey, R.B., Chromosomal analysis of heat-shock tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster evolving at different temperatures in the laboratory (1995) Evolution, 49, pp. 676-684; Cornell, J.H., The influence of interspecific competition and other factors on the distribution of the barnacle Chthamalus stellatus (1961) Ecology, 42, pp. 710-723; Crill, W.D., Huey, R.B., Gilchrist, G.W., Within-and between-generation effects of temperature on the morphology and physiology of Drosophila melanogaster (1996) Evolution, 50, pp. 1205-1218; Edney, E.B., The water and heat relationships of fiddler crab (Uca spp.) (1961) Trans R Soc S Afr, 34, pp. 71-91; Felsenstein, J., Phylogenies and the comparative method (1985) Am Nat, 125, pp. 1-15; PHYLIP: Phylogeny Inference Package, Version 3.2 (1989) Cladistics, 5, pp. 164-166; Garland, T.J., Adolph, S.C., Why not to do two-species comparative studies: Limitations on inferring adaptation (1994) Physiol Zool, 67, pp. 797-828; Graves, J.E., Somero, G.N., Electrophoretic and functional enzymic evolution in four species of eastern Pacific barracudas from different thermal habitats (1982) Evolution, 36, pp. 97-106; Haig, J., The Porcellanidae (Crustacea: Anomura) of the eastern Pacific (1960) Allan Hancock Pac Exped, 24, pp. 1-440; Harvey, P.H., Pagel, M.D., (1991) The Comparative Method in Evolutionary Biology, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Hochachka, P.W., Somero, G.N., (1984) Biochemical Adaptation, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J; Jensen, G.C., Armstrong, D.A., Intertidal zonation among congeners: Factors regulating distribution of porcelain crabs Petrolisthes spp. (Anomura: Porcellanidae) (1991) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 73, pp. 47-60; Miller, D., McLennan, A.G., The heat shock response of the brine shrimp Artemia.
