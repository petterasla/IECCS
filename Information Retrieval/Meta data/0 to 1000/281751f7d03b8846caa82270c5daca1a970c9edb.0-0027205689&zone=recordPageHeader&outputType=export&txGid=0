Although CO2 is still released when fuels derived from algal biomass are burned, integration of microalgal farms for flue gas capture approximately doubles the amount of energy produced per unit of CO2 released. Materials derived from microalgal biomass also can be used for other long-term uses, serving to sequester CO2. Flue gas has the potential to provide sufficient quantities of CO2 for such large-scale microalgae farms. Viewing microalgae farms as a means to reduce the effects of a greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, CO2) changes the view of the economics of the process. Instead of requiring that microalgae-derived fuel be cost competitive with fossil fuels, the process economics must be compared with those of other technologies proposed to deal with the problem of CO2 pollution. However, development of alternative, environmentally safer energy production technologies will benefit society whether or not global climate change actually occurs. Microalgal biomass production has great potential to contribute to world energy supplies, and to control CO2 emissions as the demand for energy increases. This technology makes productive use of arid and semi-arid lands and highly saline water, resources that are not suitable for agriculture and other biomass technologies. © 1993.","biomass; Global climate change; greenhouse gas; microalgae","Algae; Carbon dioxide; Flue gases; Renewable energy resources; Algal biomass; Aquatic biomass; Microalgae farms; Microalgal biomass; Biomass; algae",,,,,,"Schneider, The greenhouse effect: science and policy (1989) Science, 243, pp. 771-781; United States Environmental Protection Agency, Great plains (1988) The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change on the United States: Draft Report to Congress, Vol. 1: Regional Studies, pp. 7.1-7.30. , J.B Smith, D.A Tirpak, 5th edn., EPA, Office of Research and Development, Washington, D.C, PB89-161053; United States En vironmental Protection Agency, Sea-level rise (1988) The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change on the United States: Draft Report to Congress Vol. 2: National Studies, pp. 9.1-9.47. , J.B Smith, D.A Tirpak, 5th edn., EPA, Office of Research and Development, Washington, D.C, PB89-161061; Edmonds, Ashton, Cheng, Steinberg, A Preliminary Analysis of U.S. CO2 Emissions Reduction Potential from Energy Conservation and the Substitution of Natural Gas for Coal in the Period to 2010 (1989) DOE/NBB-0085, p. 61. , 5th edn., U.S. Department of Energy, Washington D.C; Production by the U.S. Chemical Industry (1990) Ch.
