In this study, the possible effects of climate warming on the national northern limits of cropping systems, the northern limits of winter wheat and double rice, and the stable-yield northern limits of rainfed winter wheat-summer maize rotation in China from 1981 to 2007 were analyzed. Also, the possible change of crop yield caused by planting limits displacement during the periods 1950s-1981 and 1981-2007 was compared and discussed. The recognized calculation methods of agricultural climatic indices were employed. According to the indices of climatic regionalization for cropping systems, the national northern limits of cropping systems, winter wheat and double rice, and the stable-yield northern limits of rainfed winter wheat-summer maize rotation during two periods, including the 1950s-1980 and 1981-2007, were drawn with ArcGIS software. Compared with the situation during the 1950s-1980, the northern limits of double cropping system during 1981-2007 showed significant spatial displacement in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and Liaoning provinces and Beijing municipality, China. The northern limits of triple cropping system showed the maximum spatial displacement in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, China. Without considering variety change and social economic factors, the per unit area grain yield of main planting patterns would increase about 54-106% if single cropping system was replaced by double cropping system, which turned out to be 27-58% if double cropping system was replaced by triple cropping system. In Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia autonomous regions, China, the northern limits of winter wheat during 1981-2007 moved northward and expanded westward in different degrees, compared with those during the 1950s-1980. Taking Hebei Province as an example, the northern limits of winter wheat moved northward, and the per unit area grain yield would averagely increase about 25% in the change region if the spring wheat was replaced by winter wheat. In Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, China, the planting northern limits of double rice moved northward, and the per unit area grain yield would increase in different degrees only from the perspective of heat resource. The stable-yield northern limits of rainfed winter wheat-summer maize rotation moved southeastward in most regions, which was caused by the decrease of local precipitation in recent years. During the past 50 yr, climate warming made the national northern limits of cropping systems move northward in different degrees, the northern limits of winter wheat and double rice both moved northward, and the cropping system change would cause the increase of per unit area grain yield in the change region. However, the stable-yield northern limits of rainfed winter wheat-summer maize rotation moved southeastward due to the decrease of precipitation. © 2011 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.","Climate warming; Crop yield; The northern limits of cropping system; The planting northern limits of double rice; The planting northern limits of winter wheat","Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",,,,,,"Axel, T., Agricultural irrigation demand under present and future climate scenarios in China (2008) Global and Planetary Change, 60, pp. 306-326; Cui, D.C., Cao, G.C., Zhang, W., Zhang, C.Q., (1991) Climatical Ecological Divisions of Wheat in China, , Science and Technology Press, Guizhou, China, (in Chinese); Ding, Y.H., Dai, X.S., Temperature variation in China during the last 100 years (1994) Meteorology Monthly, 20, pp. 19-26. , (in Chinese); Ding, Y.H., Ren, G.Y., Shi, G.Y., Guan, P., Zheng, X.H., Zhai, P.M., Zhang, D.E., Wang, H.J., National assessment report of climate change (I): Climate change in China and its future trend (2006) Advances in Climate Change Research, 2, pp. 3-8. , (in Chinese); Francesco, N.T., Marcello, D., Rosenzweig, C., Claudio, O.S., Effects of climate change and elevated CO2 on cropping systems: Model predictions at two Italian locations (2000) European Journal of Agronomy, 13, pp. 179-189; Hao, Z.X., Zheng, J.Y., Tao, X.X., A study on northern boundary of winter wheat during climate warming: A case study in Liaoning Province (2001) Progress in Geography, 20, pp. 254-261. , (in Chinese); Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y.H., Griggs, D.G., Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis (2001) Contribution of Working Group 1 to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.
