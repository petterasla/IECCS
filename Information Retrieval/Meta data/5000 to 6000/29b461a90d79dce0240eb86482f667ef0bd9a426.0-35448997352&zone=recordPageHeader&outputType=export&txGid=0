A group of juvenile Atlantic cod (initial mass 9.5 g) were reared for 3 months under simulated natural photoperiod or continuous light, and a range of temperatures (7, 10, 13 and 16°C, and a group called T-step, i.e. with temperature reduced successively from 16 to 13 and 10°C). After termination of the laboratory trial, the fish were moved to sea pens and reared at ambient conditions for 30 months before harvesting in June 2006. Observed growth gain from the 3 month laboratory trial was still persistent following the 30 months of sea-pen ongrowing. The T-step group displayed 15, 13, 1 and 10% superior mass gain respectively than the groups initially at 7, 10, 13 and 16°C at harvest in June 2006. Similarly, rearing under continuous light during the initial 3 month period during the early juvenile stage resulted in 1-9% larger size at harvesting compared to fish reared at simulated natural photoperiod. Gonado-somatic and hepato-somatic indices were similar in all groups. Contribution to the understanding of the mechanism behind size variation in adult fish can have wide range applications for Atlantic cod fisheries and aquaculture. © 2007 The Authors.","Atlantic cod; Environmental manipulation; Global warming; Growth; Long-term effects; Maturation","Gadus morhua; Pennatulacea",,,,,,"Baumann, H., Hinrichsen, H.H., Moellmann, C., Koester, F.W., Malzahn, A.M., Temming, A., Recruitment variability in Baltic Sea sprat (Sprattus sprattus) is tightly coupled to temperature and transport patterns affecting the larval and early juvenile stages (2006) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 63, pp. 2191-2201; Billerbeck, J.M., Schultz, E.T., Conover, D.O., Adaptive variation in energy acquisition and allocation among latitudinal populations of the Atlantic silverside (2000) Oecologia, 122, pp. 210-219; Brander, K.M., The effect of temperature on growth of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.)
