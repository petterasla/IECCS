The effect of a 50-yr period of climate change on peak biomass (overwintering biomass plus seasonal production) in E. vaginatum was explored. The authors use climate change to refer to linear increases over a 50-yr period in temperature (from 8-13°C), season length (from 100-120d), and atmospheric CO2 (from 340-680 μL/L). A wide range of nitrogen availabilities (from 9-18 g/m-2.yr-1) was also examined because of its importance in productivity. The model predicts that a simultaneous increase in the direct effects of temperature, season length, and CO2 with no change in N availability, will result in a slight decrease in peak biomass. A simulated long-term doubling of nitrogen availability results in an c70% increase in peak biomass, whereas with concurrent changes in climate and N availability, the model predicts a slight decline in peak biomass compared to increases in N alone. The model predicts that climate change will have substantial effects on E. vaginatum only indirectly through changes in N availability. At low-to moderate increases in N availability, the predicted response of E. vaginatum to climate change is linearly (and almost exclusively) dependent on our ability to predict the effects of climate change on nitrogen cycling. At nitrogen availabilities &gt;2 × current availabilities, the relationship flattens out very rapidly because the plant becomes limited by carbon uptake. Thus, if nitrogen availabilities more than double in the future, E. vaginatum may shift from being a nutrient-limited to a carbon-limited system and, consequently, increased season length and elevated CO2 concentrations may play an important role in controlling E. vaginatum productivity. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; climatic change; sedge; Arctic; Eriophorum vaginatum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10510761,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027078914
