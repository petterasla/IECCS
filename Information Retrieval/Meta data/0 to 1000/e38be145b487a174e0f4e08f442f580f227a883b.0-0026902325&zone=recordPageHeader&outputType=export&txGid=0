Methane outputs ranged from 3.1 to 8.3% (mean 5.5) of gross energy intake for 134 dry cow balance trials and from 1.7 to 14.9% (mean 5.2) of gross energy intake for 358 lactating cow energy balance trials. This is equivalent to 176 and 300 g/d or 245 and 419 L/d of CH4 for dry and lactating Holstein cows, respectively. Digestibilites of hemicellulose and neutral detergent solubles were positive predictors, and cellulose digestibility was a negative predictor of CH4 output in dry cows fed all forage diets, but hemicellulose digestibility was not a significant variable for predicting CH4 production by lactating cows fed diets with concentrate and forages. Fiber digestibility generally remained in models to predict CH4 output. Except for one data set, regression equations accounted for 50 to 72% of the variation in percentage of gross energy partitioned to CH4 by Holstein cows. Results confirm that increased concentrate feeding reduces CH4 production. Supplementation of lactation diets with fat generally increases fat digestibility, and this trait was associated with reduced CH4 output. Results enable 1) estimation of CH4 output for calculation of metabolizable energy and 2) computation of the contribution from dairy cows to global warming.",,"methane; animal; animal food; article; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; cattle; energy metabolism; female; lactation; metabolism; physiology; Animal; Animal Feed; Cattle; Dietary Carbohydrates; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Lactation; Methane",,"methane, 74-82-8; Dietary Carbohydrates; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,,"Holter, J.B.",,,,,,,,00220302,,,1401368,"English","J Dairy Sci",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026902325
