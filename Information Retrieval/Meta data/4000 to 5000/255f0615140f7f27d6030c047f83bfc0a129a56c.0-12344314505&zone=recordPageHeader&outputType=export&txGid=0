Zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) alternatives, such as hydrofluorocarbons (MFCs) and hydrocarbons (normal pentane, isopentane, and cyclopentane), have been introduced to replace HCFC-141b, However, none of these alternatives can match the performance of HCFC-141b in terms of handling, economics, and overall final product performance. In particular, the fire performance of hydrocarbons-based foams cannot reach the performance previously achieved with HCFC-141b. trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene is a liquid at room temperature (b.p. 48°C). It does not deplete the ozone layer1, and it has very low global warming potential (GWP) because it has very short atmospheric lifetime. We have recently reported that when trans-1,2-dichloroethylene is used in urethane foams with hydrocarbons, it could improve the fire performance of the foams, based on a small-scale fire test (Mobil 45). In this paper, we report physical properties of hydrocarbons/trans-1,2-dichloroethylene foams, such as dimensional stability and compressive strength. We have also extended our studies of the use of trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, and report on the fire performance of HFC-blown urethane foams incorporating trans-1,2-dichloroethylene2.","Foam blowing agent; Foam fire performance; Foam fire resistance; Urethane foam; Urethane foam additives","Chlorine compounds; Fire resistance; Flammability; Fluorocarbons; Foam control; Foams; Global warming; Mixtures; Ozone; Paraffins; Smoke; Solubility; Thermal insulation; Cyclopentane; Foam blowing agent; Foam fire performance; Foam fire resistance; Ozone depletion potential (ODP); trans-1,2-dichloroethylene; Urethane foam; Urethane foam additives; Ethylene",,,,,,"Johnson, B., Haworth, J., McInerney, E., Swatkowski, L., HFCs as blowing agents for domestic refrigerator insulating foam (1999) The Earth Technologies Forum, p. 273; Deeg, W., Johnson, R., Hayslett, M., Hortin, K., Influence of blowing agent selection and foam aging on energy consumption and TEWI of refrigerators (1998) The Earth Technologies Forum, p. 270; Pignagnoli, F., Bertucelli, L., Mercati, A., Huspek, M.R., (2001) Environmental and Thermal Insulation Requirements for Polyurethane Rigid Foams for the Professional Cold Chain Industry, , (August), In: PU Latin America, Sao Paulo; Berrier, R.E., Singh, S.N., Costa, J.S., Bonapersona, V., Hydrocarbon blown rigid polyurethane foam for The boardstock industry - A novel approach (1998) Polyurethanes Expo '98, pp. 5-14; Dournel, P., Zipfel, L., Analysis of the evolution of PIR foams in the context of the phaseout of HCFCs (2001) Polyurethanes Expo '2001, pp. 325-332; Wu, J., Dillon, D., Crooker, R., Hydrochlorocarbons/pentanes coblown PIR foams for improved fire performance (2003) Polyurethanes Conference Proceeding, p. 144; Standard Test Method for Heat and Visible Smoke Release Rates for Materials and Products Using An Oxygen Consumption Calorimeter, , ASTM E 1354","Wu, J.; Arkema Inc., 900 First Avenue, King of Prussia, PA 19406, United States; email: jinhuang.wu@arkemagroup.com",,,,,,,,0021955X,,JCUPA,,"English","J Cell Plast",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-12344314505
