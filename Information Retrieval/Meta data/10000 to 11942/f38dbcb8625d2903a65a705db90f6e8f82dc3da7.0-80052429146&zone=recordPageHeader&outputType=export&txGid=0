Hence, an increase in the intensity of coastal upwelling was expected in the main upwelling ecosystems around the world. However, recently published analyses of the evolution of coastal upwelling processes have shown contradictory evidence. For this reason, time series of sea-surface temperature (SST) and the upwelling index I w extracted from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project database and covering the last 6 decades were studied. The time series analyses focused on the northern part of the Canary Current System and included comparisons with upwelling systems off NW Africa, California, Benguela and Peru. Climatic indices, including the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation, Eastern Atlantic Pattern, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation Index and North Atlantic Oscillation, were investigated to explain the variability found in the NCEP/NCAR time series. A general sea-surface warming and weakening of the upwelling intensity in the Iberian/ Canary and NW African regions were found and these have intensified in the last 4 decades. These trends were clearly observed in winter and autumn for both regions, and a weakening in the upwelling intensity was also detected in summer in the NW African region. The North Atlantic Oscillation and the Eastern Atlantic Pattern indices correlated with both SST and I w, particularly in winter and spring, and also with both the Iberian/ Canary and NW African regions. No clear trend was found for the California region, while, conforming to the hypothesis, the Benguela region exhibited enhancement of upwelling, but only slight sea-surface warming. In contrast, the Peru region indicated a weakening of upwelling accompanied by marginal sea-surface warming. © Inter-Research 2011.","Coastal upwelling; Global warming; Interannual variability; Ocean- atmosphere coupling; Temperature trends","Benguela; California; Climatic index; Coastal upwelling; Current system; Ekman transport; Inter-decadal pacific oscillations; Interannual variability; Long-term variability; NCEP/NCAR; North Atlantic oscillations; Ocean- atmosphere coupling; Pattern index; Reanalysis project; Sea surface temperatures; Temperature trends; Upwelling indices; Upwelling intensity; Upwelling systems; Warming process; Wind patterns; Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Coastal engineering; Global warming; Surface properties; Surface waters; Time series; Time series analysis; Atmospheric temperature; annual variation; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate oscillation; database; Ekman transport; global warming; long-term change; sea surface temperature; time series; upwelling; Africa; Angola; Benguela; California; Canary Islands; Iberian Peninsula; Peru; Spain; United States",,,,,,"Aristegui, J., Sangra, P., Hernandez-Leon, S., Canton, M., Hernandez-Guerra, A., Kerling, J.L., Island-induced eddies in the Canary Islands (1994) Deep-Sea Research, Part I, 41 (10), pp. 1509-1525; Arístegui, J., Álvarez-Salgado, X.A., Barton, E.D., Figueiras, F.G., Hernández-León, S., Roy, C., Santos, A.M.P., Oceanography and fisheries of the Canary Current/Iberian region of the eastern North Atlantic (18a, E) (2004) The Sea, 14. , Robinson AR, Kenneth HB (eds), President and Fellows of Harvard College, Cambridge, MA; Arístegui, J., Barton, E.D., Álvarez-Salgado, X.A., Santos, A.M.P., Sub-regional ecosystem variability in the Canary Current upwelling (2009) Prog Oceanogr, 83, pp. 33-48; Bakun, A., Coastal upwelling indices, west coast of North America 1946-1971 (1973) NOAA Tech Rep NMFS SSRF-671; Bakun, A., Global climate change and intensification of coastal upwelling (1990) Science, 247, pp. 198-201; Bakun, A., Field, D.B., Redondo-Rodríguez, A., Weeks, S.J., Greenhouse gas, upwelling-favourable winds, and the future of coastal ocean upwelling ecosystems (2009) Glob Change Biol, 16, pp. 1213-1228; Barth, J.A., Menge, B.A., Lubchenco, J., Chan, F., Bane, J.M., Kirincich, A.R., McManus, M.A., Washburn, L., Delayed upwelling alters nearshore coastal ocean ecosystems in the northern California current (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104 (10), pp. 3719-3724. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.0700462104; Barton, E.D., Eastern boundary of the North Atlantic: Northwest Africa and Iberia.
