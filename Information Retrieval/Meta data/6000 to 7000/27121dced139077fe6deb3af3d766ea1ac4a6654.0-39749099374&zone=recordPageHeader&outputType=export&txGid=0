Box 71, H-8361 Keszthely, Hungary","Higher atmospheric CO2 concentration may influence positively plant production once the substrate for photosynthesis and gradient increase between the ambient air and mesophyll cells. Plants respond not only to change in surrounding CO2 concentration, but to modifications of their microenvironment. Modelling approach was applied to investigate the relation of plants and some elements of microclimate to increased CO2 levels. Other influences of global warming included in the study indirectly by running warmer and dryer sample days than the average measured locally during the past decades. Depending on growth in CO2 concentration increases in inside canopy air temperatures were between 0.12 and 0.37°C. The warmer plants could have less effective transpiration cooling resulted from higher stomatal resistances. It decreased the water vapour pressure of the air inside the plant stand. In spite of partly stomatal closure, abundant carbon-dioxide concentration raised the intensity of photosynthesis. However if elevated CO2 concentration takes place, the other additional influencing factors as warming, change in precipitation amount and its distribution, plant adaptation processes etc. may offset the production benefits of increasing level of CO2. More detailed investigations are needed to complete our imaginations about future consequences of possible climate variations, mainly in local level. © 2008, Penkala Bt.","Global warming; Microclimate; Physiology of maize; Simulation","Zea mays",,,,,,"Anda, A., (2001) Microclimatological evaluation of some methods to influence the plant microclimate, , DSc.
