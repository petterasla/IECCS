Many studies predict that impacts will consist largely of shifts in latitudinal and altitudinal distributions. However, we demonstrate that the impacts of global climate change in the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia have the potential to result in many extinctions. We develop bioclimatic models of spatial distribution for the regionally endemic rainforest vertebrates and use these models to predict the effects of climate warming on species distributions. Increasing temperature is predicted to result in significant reduction or complete loss of the core environment of all regionally endemic vertebrates. Extinction rates caused by the complete loss of core environments are likely to be severe, nonlinear, with losses increasing rapidly beyond an increase of 2°C, and compounded by other climate-related impacts. Mountain ecosystems around the world, such as the Australian Wet Tropics bioregion, are very diverse, often with high levels of restricted endemism, and are therefore important areas of biodiversity. The results presented here suggest that these systems are severely threatened by climate change.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Extinction; Montane; Rainforest; Range size","biodiversity; climate change; extinction; geographical distribution; global change; rainforest; article; Australia; biodiversity; biogeographic region; climate change; disaster; ecosystem; environmental impact; global climate; greenhouse effect; model; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; species endemicity; species extinction; tropic climate; tropical rain forest; vertebrate; Animals; Australia; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Temperature; Trees; Tropical Climate; Vertebrates; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Easterling, D.R., Meehl, G.A., Parmesan, C., Changnon, S.A., Karl, T.R., Mearns, L.O., Climate extremes: Observations, modelling, and impacts (2000) Science, 289, pp. 2068-2074; Frith, C.B., Frith, D.W., Seasonality of insect abundance in an Australian upland tropical rainforest (1985) Aust.
