The lapse rate in a convectively unstable layer is used for the present analysis. The mean precipitation intensity during the simulated period generally increases with the increase in lapse rate, while the maximum precipitation intensity increases with the decrease in lapse rate. The precipitation mean is dependent on the intensity of cold pool resulting from organized convective clouds. In contrast, the precipitation maxima is regulated by relative humidity within the tropospheric lower layer. In an environment with higher lapse rate, a larger amount of CAPE is distributed in a deeper layer of the lower troposphere, which is beneficial for the development and intensification of convection and precipitation. Lapse rate in the troposphere is useful in comparing the characteristics of precipitation produced by mesoscale convective systems that occur in various climate regions of the world and also produced in a future climate under global warming. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud dynamics; Cumulus convection; Precipitating cloud systems; Static stability","Climate regions; Cloud dynamics; Cold pool; Convective clouds; Cumulus convection; Environmental temperature; Future climate; Lapse rate; Lower troposphere; Mean precipitation; Mesoscale Convective System; Model configuration; Numerical experiments; Precipitating clouds; Precipitation intensity; Relative humidities; Squall lines; Static stability; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Atmospherics; Clouds; Global warming; Storms; Troposphere; System stability; air temperature; atmospheric lapse rate; atmospheric modeling; cloud cover; cold pool; computer simulation; convection; convective cloud; convective system; cumulus; mesoscale meteorology; numerical model; precipitation intensity; relative humidity; squall line; troposphere",,,,,,"Barnes, G.M., Sieckman, K., The environment of fast- and slow-moving tropical mesoscale convective cloud lines (1984) Mon.
