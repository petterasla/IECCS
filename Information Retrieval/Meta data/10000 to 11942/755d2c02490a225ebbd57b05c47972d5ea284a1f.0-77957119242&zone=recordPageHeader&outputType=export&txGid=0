The work spread during the 1960s, and by the 1970s a few modelers had produced somewhat realistic looking models of the planet's regional climate pattern. The work took on wider interest when modelers tried increasing the level of greenhouse gases, and invariably found serious global warming. Skeptics pointed to dubious technical features, but by the late 1990s these problems were largely resolved-thanks to enormous increases in computer power, the number and size of the closely interacting teams that now comprised the international modeling community, and the crucial availability of field experiments and satellite data to set against the models' assumptions and outputs. By 2007 nearly all climate experts accepted that the climate simulations represented reality well enough to impel strong action to restrict gas emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmosphere; Circulation; Climate; Computer; Model; Simulation",,,,,,,"Annan, J.D., Hargreaves, J.C., Using multiple observationally-based constraints to estimate climate sensitivity (2006) Geophysical Research Letters, 33, pp. L06704; Arakawa, A., (1970), 2, pp. 24-40. , Numerical simulation of large-scale atmospheric motions.
