Collins CO 80523, United States","The Great Plains landscape is less topographically complex than most other regions within North America, but diverse aquatic ecosystems, such as playas, pothole lakes, ox-bow lakes, springs, groundwater aquifers, intermittent and ephemeral streams, as well as large rivers and wetlands, are highly dynamic and responsive to extremes in north-south differences in summer temperatures and east-west differences in aridity across four large subregions. These physical driving forces alter density stratification, deoxygenation, decomposition and salinity. Biotic community composition and associated ecosystem processes of productivity and nutrient cycling respond rapidly to these climatically driven dynamics. Ecosystem processes also respond to cultural effects such as dams and diversions of water for irrigation, waste dilution and urban demands for drinking water and industrial uses. Distinguishing climatic from cultural effects in future models of aquatic ecosystem functioning will require more refinement in both climatic and economic forecasting. There is a need, for example, to predict how long-term climatic forecasts (based on both ENSO and global warming simulations) relate to the permanence and productivity of shallow water ecosystems.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Density stratification; Aquifers; Dams; Drought; Environmental impact; Floods; Global warming; Groundwater; Lakes; Potable water; Rivers; Ecosystems; anthropogenic effect; aquatic ecosystem; climate change; hydrological response; North America, Great Plains",,,,,,,"Covich, A.P.; Dept Fishery + Wildlife Biol, Colorado State Univ, Ft.
