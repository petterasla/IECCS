The maximum Atlantic overturning is confirmed to be quadratic in D but is also shown to be linear in a meridional density difference. Our simulations strongly suggest that the theory needs to be complemented by a dynamical equation for since changes in both D and δp are significant and mutually independent. While, under global warming D varies strongly and δp is practically constant, the situation is reversed for altered surface freshwater fluxes. Similarly, variations in the meridional length scale of Southern Ocean outcropping require a dynamical equation in order to capture the fundamental behavior of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"Climate models; Global warming; Atlantic meridional overturning circulations; Basic equations; Coupled climate model; Density difference; Dynamical equation; Freshwater fluxes; Length scale; Southern Ocean; Vertical mixing; Oceanography; climate modeling; eddy; freshwater input; global warming; meridional circulation; overturn; pycnocline; surface water; upwelling; vertical mixing; wind stress; Atlantic Ocean; Southern Ocean",,,,,,"Bryan, F., On the parameter sensitivity of primitive equation ocean general circulation models (1987) J.
