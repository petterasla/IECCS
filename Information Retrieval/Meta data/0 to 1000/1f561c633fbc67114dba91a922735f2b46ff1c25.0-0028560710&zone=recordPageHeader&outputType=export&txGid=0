CO 2 fertilization and temperature effects are included in the terrestrial biosphere compartment, and the ocean compartment includes inorganic chemistry which, with ocean water circulation, enables the calculation of time-variable oceanic carbon uptake. Model-derived Q 10 values (the increasing rate for every 10°C increase of temperature) are 1.37 for land biota photosynthesis, 1.89 for land biota respiration, and 1.95 for soil respiration, and feedback temperature is set at 0.01°C/ppm of CO 2. These could be the important parameters controlling the carbon cycle in potential global warming scenarios. The ocean buffering capacity to take up excess CO 2 will decrease with the increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration. -from Authors",,"atmospheric carbon dioxide; biosphere-ocean interaction; global carbon model; global warming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08866236,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028560710
