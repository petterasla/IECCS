Climate changes affect us all both at a global and at a national level. Although scientific analyses show that climate changes cover a very long period of time (up to millions of years), yet, the history of the last decades shows that some climate changes are faster and faster because of objective, intrinsic processes of the planet as well as due to the human activity. In the last years, one could see an increase of extreme climate phenomena, such as drought, floods, tornados - even in Romania - as well as growing erosion of the Black Sea coast. Romania answered promptly to the measures taken at global and European level as far as climate changes are concerned. Romania adopted the main documents of the EU, set up institutions whose role was to support the fight, wrote and sent reports about the gas emissions at national level. Unfortunately, judicial actions were not supported by the society and did not receive funding.","Climate derangements; Copenhagen conference; Global climate changes; Global increase of temperatures; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; High level meeting in rio (1992); Kyoto protocol; United nations convention on climate changes (unccc)",,,,,,,"Barbu, S., (2005) Foreword, Romania's National Strategy about Climate Changes, , http://www.mmediu.ro/departament-mediu/schimbari-climatice/1-Documentatie/SNSC-ro.pdf; United Nations Convention on Climate Changes, , http://www.gradinamea.ro/Conventia-Cadru-a-Natiunilor-Unite-asupraschimbarilor-climatice-4656647-l.html; Kyoto Protocol, , http://www.mmediu.ro/departament-mediu/schimbari-climatice/1-Documentatie/Protocolul-Kyoto-ro.pdf; -http://schimbariclimatice.amr.ro/cadru-general.html, General considerations about climate changes in Romania, Ministry for the Environment and Durable DevelopmentRomania si Uniunea Europeana Finanţarea acţiunilor de combatere a schimbǎrilor climatice Informaţia.ro 15.09.2009http://www.amosnews.ro/module-Pagesetter-viewpub-tid-24-pid-16-Romania-si-Uniunea-Europeana-INFO.phtml(2008) Românii preocupaţi de schimbǎrile climatice dar incapabili sǎ facǎ ceva Ziare.com, 11 septembrie, , http://www.ziare.com/actual/social/09-11-2008/romaniipreocupati-de-schimbarile-climatice-dar-incapabili-sa-facaceva-409527; (2008) Romǎnia peste 50 ani: Deşerturi şi oraşe inundate Ziare.com, 15 Iulie, , http://www.ziare.com/actual/social/07-15-2008/romaniapeste-50-de-ani-deserturi-si-orase-inundate-358203","Brezoi, A.
