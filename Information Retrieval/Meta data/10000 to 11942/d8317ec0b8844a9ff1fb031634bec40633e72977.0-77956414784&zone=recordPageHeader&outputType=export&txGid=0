This paper uses simulation modeling and the principles of decision making under uncertainty to translate climate information into tools for vulnerability assessment and urban climate adaptation. A dynamic simulation model, WaterSim, is used to explore future water-shortage conditions in Phoenix. Results indicate that policy action will be needed to attain water sustainability in 2030, even without reductions in river flows caused by climate change. Challenging but feasible changes in lifestyle and slower rates of population growth would allow the region to avoid shortage conditions and achieve groundwater sustainability under all but the most dire climate scenarios. Changes in lifestyle involve more native desert landscaping and fewer pools in addition to slower growth and higher urban densities. There is not a single most likely or optimal future for Phoenix. Urban climate adaptation involves using science-based models to anticipate water shortage and manage climate risk.","Climate change; Decision making under uncertainty; Simulation modeling; Water sustainability","ground water; water; acclimatization; article; climate change; decision making; drought; lifestyle modification; population growth; priority journal; river; simulation; water supply; Arizona; Climate; Computer Simulation; Droughts; Global Warming; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Population Growth; Rivers; Water Supply",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Christensen, N.S., Wood, A.W., Voisin, N., Lettenmaier, D.P., Palmer, R.N., The effects of climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the Colorado River Basin (2004) Clim Change, 62, pp. 337-363; Seager, R., Model projections of an imminent transition to a more arid climate in southwestern North America (2007) Science, 316, pp. 1181-1184; Christensen, N.S., Lettenmaier, D.P., A multimodel ensemble approach to assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrology and water resources of the Colorado River basin (2007) Hydrol Earth Syst Sci, 11, pp. 1417-1434; (2007) Colorado River Basin Water Management: Evaluating and Adjusting to Hydroclimatic Variability, , National Research Council (National Academy Press, Washington, DC); Barnett, T.P., Pierce, D.W., When will Lake Mead go dry?
