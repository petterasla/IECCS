Scenario planning requires an understanding of the driving forces and trends facing an enterprise, that can result in a reasonably accurate prediction of the future. The plan includes global warming strategies, utilities to help manage human resource challenges, and creative partnering and regionalization for best management practices. It is believed that the technique provides better strategies for scenario planners and managers to better plan the future.",,"Regionalization; Scenario planning; Global warming; Personnel; Strategic planning; Uncertain systems; Water supply; Water treatment",,,,,,"Fahey, L., Randall, R.M., (1997) Learning from the Future: Competitive Foresight Scenarios, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; (2001) Grasping the Future: Comparing Scenario Planning to Other Forecasting Techniques, , www.manyworlds.com/1/conten/whitepapers/CO4120214515558.pdf, accessed July 20, 2005; Means, E., (2004) Update of Strategic Assessment of the Future of Water Utilities: Trend Paper, , AwwaRF, Denver, Colo. awwarf.org/research/topicsandprojects/resources/ specialreports/trends/index.aspx.
