In addition, it presents the simulated change in water availability that might be realized in a few centuries in response to a quadrupling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Averaging the results over extended periods, the radiatively forced changes, which are very similar between the two sets of experiments, were successfully extracted. The analysis indicates that the discharges from Arctic rivers such as the Mackenzie and Ob' increase by up to 20% (of the pre-Industrial Period level) by the middle of the 21st century and by up to 40% or more in a few centuries. In the tropics, the discharges from the Amazonas and Ganga-Brahmaputra rivers increase substantially. However, the percentage changes in runoff from other tropical and many mid-latitude rivers are smaller, with both positive and negative signs. For soil moisture, the results of this study indicate reductions during much of the year in many semiarid regions of the world, such as the southwestern region of North America, the northeastern region of China, the Mediterranean coast of Europe, and the grasslands of Australia and Africa. As a percentage, the reduction is particularly large during the dry season. From middle to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, soil moisture decreases in summer but increases in winter.","Coupled model; Global climate change; Global warming; Potential evaporation; Precipitation; River discharge; Soil moisture; Water availability","Arid regions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Moisture; Soils; River discharges; Soil moisture; Rivers; climate change; global warming; hydrological regime; precipitation (climatology); river discharge; soil moisture",,,,,,"Alcamo, J., Döll, P., Kasper, F., Siebert, S., (1997) Global Change and Global Scenario of Water Use and Availability: An Application of Water Gap 1.0, , University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany; Alcamo, J., Döll, P., Henrichs, T., Kaspar, F., Lehner, B., Rösch, T., Siebert, S., Development and testing of the WaterGAP2 global model of water use and variability (2003) Hydrol.
