Recent estimates of the total volume occupied by gas hydrates in marine sediments vary 20-fold, from 1.2 x 1014 to 2.4 x 1015 m3. Using a specific volume change on melting of -21%, dissociation of the current global inventory of hydrate would result in a decrease of submarine hydrate volume of 2.4 x 1013 to 5.0 x 1014 m3. Release of free gas bubbles present beneath hydrates would increase these volumes by 1.1-2.0 x 1013 m3. The combined effects of hydrate melting and subhydrate gas release would result conservatively in a global sea-level fall of 10-146 cm. Such a mechanism may offset some future sea-level rise associated with thermal expansion of the oceans. It could also explain anomalous sea-level drops during ice-free periods such as the early Eocene, the Cretaceous, and the Devonian.",,"clathrate; climate change; eustacy; sea level change",,,,,,"Barrera, E., Savin, S.M., Thomas, E., Jones, C.E., Evidence for thermohaline-circulation reversals controlled by sea-level change in the latest Cretaceous (1997) Geology, 25, pp. 715-718; Berry, W.B.N., Wilde, P., Progressive ventilation of the oceans; an explanation for the distribution of the lower Paleozoic black shales (1978) American Journal of Science, 278, pp. 257-275; Bice, K.L., Barron, E.J., Peterson, W.H., Continental runoff and early Cenozoic bottom-water sources (1997) Geology, 25, pp. 951-954; Bralower, T.J., Thomas, D.J., Zachos, J.C., Hirschmann, M.M., Roehl, U., Sigurdsson, H., Thomas, E., Whitney, D.L., High-resolution records of the late Paleocene thermal maximum and circum-Caribbean volcanism: Is there a causal link?
