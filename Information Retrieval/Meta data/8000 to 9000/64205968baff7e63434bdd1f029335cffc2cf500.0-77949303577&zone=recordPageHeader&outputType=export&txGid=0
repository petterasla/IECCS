In previous research, attention has mainly focused on the minimization of cost, due to the high expenditure associated with the construction and maintenance of such systems. However, the impacts of WDSs on the environment usually have not been considered adequately. The recent increasing awareness of sustainability and climate change, especially global warming, has led to research where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered. In the study described in this paper a multiobjective genetic algorithm for WDS optimization has been used as an explorative tool to investigate the trade-offs between the traditional economic objective of minimizing costs and an additional environmental objective of minimizing GHG emissions. The impacts of minimizing GHG emissions on the results of WDS optimization have been explored for a case study in this paper. The results indicate that the inclusion of GHG emission minimization as one of the objectives results in significant trade-offs between the economic and environmental objectives. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted by using different discount rates in a present value analysis for computing both ongoing costs and GHG emissions. The results obtained show that the Pareto-optimal front is very sensitive to the discount rates used. As a result, the selection of discount rates has a significant impact on final decision making. © 2010 ASCE.","Discounting; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gas emissions; Multi-objective optimization; Sustainability; Water distribution systems","Discount rates; Discounting; Environmental objectives; Final decision; GHG emission; Minimization of costs; Minimizing costs; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Pareto-optimal front; Present value; Significant impacts; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Forestry; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Research; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Water distribution systems; Water supply; Multiobjective optimization; discount rate; emission control; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; optimization; sensitivity analysis; sustainability; trade-off; water management; water planning; water resource; water supply",,,,,,"Ambrose, M.D., Salomonsson, G.D., Burn, S., Piping systems embodied energy analysis (2002), Rep.
