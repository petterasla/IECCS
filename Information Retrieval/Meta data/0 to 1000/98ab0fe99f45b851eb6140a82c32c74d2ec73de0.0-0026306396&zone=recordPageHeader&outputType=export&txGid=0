The increase in solar energy is determined at several time points in the seasonal cycles by brief integrations of the models with the surface albedo of sea ice changed to that of open ocean; temperature, cloudiness, and other climate parameters are unchanged during the short integrations. We find that the globally and annually averaged enhancement of absorbed solar flux due to removal of sea ice is 2-3W m-2; a simple calculation indicates that most of the difference between model versions is due to differences in the surface albedo of sea ice. -from Authors",,"albedo feedback; climate model; global warming; ice; sea ice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026306396
