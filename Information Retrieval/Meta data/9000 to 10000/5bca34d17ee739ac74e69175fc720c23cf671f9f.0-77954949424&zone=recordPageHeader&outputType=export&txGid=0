Two types of hydropower schemes, viz. canal-based and dam-toe schemes, have been analyzed. The energy pay-back time for canal-based scheme is found in the range of 1.18-1.31 years. The corresponding values for dam-toe are 0.44-1.12 years. Similarly, GHG emissions (gCO2eq/kWhe) from canal-based and dam-toe schemes are in the range of 32.23-35.35 and 11.91-31.2 respectively. Using the economic input-output based life cycle assessment approach, energy pay-back timeand GHG emission have been quantified.
