These metrics typically provide relative insights into the implicit concern associated with chemicals, emissions and resource consumption in the context of human health, ecological health and resource depletion. The approaches used to derive the metrics range in their site-specificity, complexity, comprehensiveness, sophistication and uncertainty. It is therefore often necessary to consider the use of more than one approach within the context of a given impact category to help support a decision. In this paper we outline some of the strengths and weaknesses of available approaches in the commonly considered categories of global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, tropospheric ozone (smog) creation, eutrophication/nutrification, acidification, toxicological impacts and resource depletion.",,"Ecology; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Global warming; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Ozone; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Troposphere; Upper atmosphere; Acidification; Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); Nutrification; Toxicology; Process engineering",,,,,,"Pennington, D.W., Norris, G., Hoagland, T., Bare, J.C., An Introduction to Metrics for the Environmental Comparison of Process and Product Alternatives in Process Design Tools for the Environment, , Sikdar S.K. and El-Halwagi M.M., editors, Taylor and Francis, UK (in press); Chemical ranking and scoring: Guidelines for relative assessments of chemicals (1997) Proceedings of the Pellston Workshop on Chemical Ranking and Scoring, 12-16 February 1995, , Swanson M.B. and Socha A.C., ed.s, SETAC Press, Florida; Gameson, T., (1998) Private Sector Methods for Weighting Environmental Indicators, , Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Joint Research Centre, European Commission; Goedkoop, M., Spriensma, R., (1999) The Eco-indicator 99: A Damage Orientated Method for Life Cycle Impact Assessment, , VROM, Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment, Netherlands; Pennington, D.W., Bare, J.C., Comparison of Human Health Screening and Ranking Approaches: The Waste Minimization Prioritization Tool (WMPT) and Toxic Equivalency Potentials (TEPs), , submitted to Risk Analysis; Heijungs, R., Guinee, J.B., Huppes, G., Lankreijer, R.M., Udo De Haes, H.A., Sleeswijk, A.W., Ansems, A.M.M., De Goede, H.P., (1992) Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Products, 1-2. , Center for Environmental Studies (CML), Leiden University, Leiden; Hauschild, M., Wenzel, H., (1997) Environmental Assessment of Products, 2. , Chapman and Hall, London; Udo De Haes, H.A., Jolliet, O., Finoveden, G., Hauschild, M., Krewitt, W., Mueller-Wenk, R., Best available practice regarding impact categories and category indicators in life cycle impact assessment -part 1 (1999) Int.
