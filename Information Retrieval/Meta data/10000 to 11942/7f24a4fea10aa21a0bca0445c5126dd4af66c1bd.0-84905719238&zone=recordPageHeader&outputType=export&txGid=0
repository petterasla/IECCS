The life cycle is considered to be made up of seven stages: (1) mining the clay, (2) atomising the clay, (3) production of frits and glazes, (4) production of ceramic tiles, (5) distribution, (6) installation and usage, and, on ending their useful life (7) treatment as construction and demolition waste. Materials and methods: A specific life cycle inventory was developed taking 1 m2 of ceramic tile over a period of 20 years as the functional unit and using annual data gathered directly from 35 Spanish enterprises involved in the different stages of the life cycle of ceramic tiles. This inventory was then used to obtain environmental indicators (global warming, ozone layer depletion, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidation and human toxicity) for each enterprise and each stage of the life cycle under study. Results and discussion: Environmental data were submitted to a statistical analysis. This analysis made it possible to model the distribution of environmental behaviour of the life cycle of ceramic tiles considering the different influences from the different companies that were consulted for each stage in the life cycle. The statistical study allowed also obtaining confidence intervals for the mean and standard deviation of the environmental results obtained for each impact category. Conclusions: The stage of the life cycle with the greatest environmental impact for all the impact categories is the manufacture of the tile, followed by the process of atomising the clay and the distribution of the product. There is a direct correlation between these findings and the high level of energy consumption (mainly natural gas and fuel) in these stages. Moreover, the statistical analysis provided 95% level of confidence intervals for the mean and the standard deviation very accurate which shows that using the mean inventory values from all the enterprises that were consulted within the same stage of the life cycle is a suitable method of working. Future users of the inventory may use the probability distributions obtained for calculating percentiles or other measures to assess their data. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Ceramic tile; Clay; Glaze; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventory (LCI); Statistical analysis",,,,,,,"Aguado, A., Josa, A., Cardim, A., Strengths and weaknesses of the inventory of cement for use in life cycle assessment (LCA) (2004) Bull of the Spanish Soc of Ceram and Glass, 43 (2), pp. 15-24; (2009) Development of Exports of Spanish Ceramic Tile Industry, Year 2008, , ASCER Press release March 18, 2009; Asif, M., Muneer, T., Kelley, R., Life cycle assessment: A case study of a dwelling home in Scotland (2007) Building and Environment, 42 (3), pp. 1391-1394. , DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.11.023, PII S0360132305004956; Blasco, A., Escardino, A., Busani, G., Montort, E., Amorós, J.L., Enrique, J., Beltrán, V., Negre, P., (1992) Treatment of Gaseous Emissions, Liquid Effluents and Solid Waste from the Ceramic Industry, , AICE-ITC e IMPIVA, Castellón; Bovea, M.D., Serrano, J., Bruscas, G.M., Gallardo, A., Application of life cycle assessment to improve the environmental performance of a ceramic tile (2005) Packag Syst, Packag Technol and Science, 19, pp. 83-95; Bovea, M.-D., Saura, U., Ferrero, J.L., Giner, J., Cradle-to-gate study of red clay for use in the ceramic industry (2007) International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 12 (6), pp. 439-447. , DOI 10.1065/lca2006.06.252; Bovea, M.D., Díaz-Albo, E., Gallardo, A., Colomer, F.J., Serrano, J., Environmental performance of ceramic tiles: Improvement proposals (2010) Mater Design, 31, pp. 35-41; (2007) Reference Document on Best Available Techniques (BAT) in the Ceramic Manufacturing Industry, , BREF European Commission, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Sevilla; Busani, G., Palmonari, C., Timellini, G., (1995) Piastrelle Ceramiche & Ambiente Edi.Cer, S.P.A., Sassuolo, Italia; Carani, G., Palmonari, C., Timellini, G., Flooring material costs (1997) Ceramica Acta, 6. , in Italian; (2008) Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Laying Down Harmonised Conditions for the Marketing of the Construction Products, , COM 311; Commission Decision 607/CE (2009) of 9 July, Concerning Establishing the Ecological Criteria for the Award of the EU Ecolabel to Hard Coverings (HC)s; Directive 1/EC (2008) of the European Parliament and the Council, of 15 January, Concerning Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control; Directive 61/EC (1996) of the European Parliament and the Council, of 24 September, Concerning Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control; The life cycle inventory data (2008) Ecoinvent V2, , version 2.
