The relative contribution to overall environmental performance of processing and distribution to final markets were also evaluated from a cradle-to-destination-port perspective. Environmental impact categories included global warming, acidification, eutrophication, cumulative energy use, and biotic resource use. Our results indicated that intensive farming had significantly higher environmental impacts per unit production than semi-intensive farming in all impact categories. The grow-out stage contributed between 96.4% and 99.6% of the cradle-to-farm-gate impacts. These impacts were mainly caused by feed production, electricity use, and farm-level effluents. By averaging over intensive (15%) and semi-intensive (85%) farming systems, 1 metric ton (t) live-weight of shrimp production in China required 38.3 ± 4.3 GJ of energy, as well as 40.4 ± 1.7 t of net primary productivity, and generated 23.1 ± 2.6 kg of SO 2 equiv, 36.9 ± 4.3 kg of PO 4 equiv, and 3.1 ± 0.4 t of CO 2 equiv. Processing made a higher contribution to cradle-to-destination-port impacts than distribution of processed shrimp from farm gate to final markets in both supply chains. In 2008, the estimated total electricity consumption, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions from Chinese white-leg shrimp production would be 1.1 billion kW•h, 49 million GJ, and 4 million metric tons, respectively. Improvements suggested for Chinese shrimp aquaculture include changes in feed composition, farm management, electricity-generating sources, and effluent treatment before discharge. Our results can be used to optimize market-oriented shrimp supply chains and promote more sustainable shrimp production and consumption. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Chicago; Cumulative energy; Data input; Domestic markets; Domestic sales; Electricity use; Electricity-consumption; Environmental performance; Export markets; Farm gates; Farm management; Farming system; Feed compositions; Hainan Province; Life-cycle assessments; Net primary productivity; Per unit; Relative contribution; Resource use; Shrimp aquaculture; Shrimp farming; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Effluent treatment; Electricity; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Farms; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Rating; Sulfur dioxide; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Zinc oxide; Shellfish; carbon dioxide; phosphoric acid; sulfur dioxide; acidification; domestication; electricity generation; environmental impact; eutrophication; export led development; farming system; global warming; greenhouse gas; hatchery; life cycle analysis; market development; net primary production; resource use; shrimp culture; sustainable development; acidification; aquaculture; article; carbon footprint; China; Chinese; chinese shrimp; commercial phenomena; commercial species; controlled study; domestic sale; effluent; electricity; energy consumption; environmental impact; eutrophication; export sale; farming system; feeding; food composition; food industry; food intake; food processing; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; hatchery; life cycle assessment; marketing; nonhuman; productivity; shrimp; sustainable agriculture; Animals; Aquaculture; Biomass; Chicago; China; Commerce; Crustacea; Environment; China; Hainan; Decapoda (Crustacea)",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; phosphoric acid, 7664-38-2; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5",,,,"(2010), http://www.fao.org, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), (.
