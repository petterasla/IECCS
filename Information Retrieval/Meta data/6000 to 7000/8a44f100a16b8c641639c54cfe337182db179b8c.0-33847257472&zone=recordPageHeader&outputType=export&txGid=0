However, little is known about the impact of spatial temperature gradients, their vulnerability to global warming, and their importance for interacting populations. Here, we studied the vertical distribution of two planktivorous fish species (Coregonus spp.) and their zooplankton prey in the deep, oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany). The night-time vertical centre of gravity both of the fish populations and of two of their prey groups, daphnids and copepods, were significantly correlated to the seasonally varying water temperature between March and December 2005. During the warmer months, fish and zooplankton occurred closer to the surface of the lake and experienced higher temperatures. The Coregonus populations differed significantly in their centre of gravity; hence, also, the temperature experienced by the populations was different. Likewise, daphnids and copepods occurred in different water depths and hence experienced different temperatures at least during the summer months. We conclude that any changes in the vertical temperature gradient of the lake as a result of potential future global warming may impact the two fish populations differently, and may shape interaction strength and timing between fish and their zooplankton prey. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Coregonus; Habitat overlap; Night-time population depth","fresh water; global warming; lacustrine environment; oligotrophic environment; phytoplankton; population size; prey availability; salmonid; seasonal variation; temperature effect; vertical distribution; water temperature; zooplankton; analysis of variance; animal; article; comparative study; copepod; Daphnia; demography; ecosystem; Germany; physiology; population density; salmonid; species difference; temperature; zooplankton; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Copepoda; Daphnia; Demography; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Germany; Population Density; Salmonidae; Species Specificity; Temperature; Zooplankton; Brandenburg; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Lake Stechlin; Copepoda; Coregonus; Daphniidae",,,,,,"Axenrot, T., Hansson, S., Predicting herring recruitment from young-of-the-year densities, spawning stock biomass, and climate (2003) Limnol Oceanogr, 48, pp. 1716-1720; Beaugrand G, Brander KM, Lindley JA, Souissi S, Reid PC (2003) Plankton effect on cod recruitment in the North Sea.
