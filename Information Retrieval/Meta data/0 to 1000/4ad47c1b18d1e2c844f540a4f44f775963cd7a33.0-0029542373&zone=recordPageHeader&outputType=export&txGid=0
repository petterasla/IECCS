Low latitude and/or developed coastal environments and communities are likely to experience the greatest changes. The role of benthic foraminifera in the trophic structure of shallow marine communities dictates that many other organisms will be affected by changes in the structure and diversity of shallow marine foraminiferal populations. -from Authors",,"benthos; climate change; climatic change; ecosystem disturbance; environmental degradation; food web; food webs; foraminifera; global warming; habitat destruction; population dynamics; shallow marine environment; Foraminifera",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00961191,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029542373
