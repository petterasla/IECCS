The author describes his early attempt to study the greenhouse effect using a one-dimensional model of radiative, convective equilibrium of the atmosphere. This is followed by the description of a recent study of global warming which employs a general circulation model of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface system developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). In particular, the study attempts to elucidate the role of oceanic and land surface processes in shaping the response of surface air temperature to a gradual increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).",,"climate modeling; general circulation model; global warming; greenhouse effect",,,,,,"Arrhenius, S., On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground (1896) Phil.
