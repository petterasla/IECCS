The authors report a case of dirofilaria conjunctivae in a 27 year old woman from Craiova; such infections are hardly to be found in our country. Our patient presented a mobile, bulbar, subconjunctival tumoral formation which was surgically removed; immature Dirofilaria repens was revealed into it. Case particularity was that the patient had not visited any of the endemic areas. Environmental changes with global warming can lead to some new unspecific diseases in our country.",,"adult; animal; article; case report; conjunctiva; conjunctiva disease; Dirofilaria; dirofilariasis; eye infection; female; human; isolation and purification; parasitology; treatment outcome; Adult; Animals; Conjunctiva; Conjunctival Diseases; Dirofilaria; Dirofilariasis; Eye Infections, Parasitic; Female; Humans; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,,"Mǎnescu, R.email: reprograf@rdslink.ro",,,,,,,,12219118,,,19388575,"Romanian","Chirurgia (Bucur)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-67449083657
