Our understanding of the attributes that make these few sites preferable is currently limited. We quantified habitat characteristics - substrate type and coloration, aspect, slope, curvature of shoreline, and availability of shade, water pools, and resting areas - at 26 sites (7 islands) occupied by sea lions and 33 unused sites (8 islands) distributed throughout the Gulf of California, Mexico. Logistic regression models were used to explore how habitat characteristics explained sea lion occupancy patterns. Models discriminated very well between occupied and unused sites, and showed that occupied locations were more often located in sites with larger-size rocks (odds ratio [OR] = 1.209), lighter-color substrates (OR = 0.219), and convex shorelines (OR = 1.067). All of these preferred characteristics are likely to play a role in the prevention of heat stress in sea lions, suggesting that increases in temperature, such as those expected from global warming, may pose an additional risk for this already declining sea lion population. To partially offset this risk, our results may be used to identify, and protect, unused but suitable (i.e., thermally favorable) habitat. In addition, we recommend effective protection and monitoring of the currently occupied areas and their populations. © 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.","Conditional logistic regression; Habitat selection; Pinniped; Sea of Cortes; Thermoregulation","breeding site; global warming; habitat conservation; habitat selection; habitat structure; pinniped; population decline; regression analysis; shoreline; species conservation; species occurrence; thermoregulation; Gulf of California; North America; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Ocean; Otariidae; Pinnipedia; Zalophus; Zalophus californianus",,,,,,"ANTONELIS, G.A., STEWART, B.S., PERRYMAN, W.F., Foraging characteristics of female northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and California sea lions (Zalophus Californianus) (1990) Canadian Journal of Zoology - Revue Canadienne De Zoologie, 68, pp. 150-158; AURIOLES-GAMBOA, D., (1988) Behavioral ecology of California sea lions in the Gulf of California, , Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, Santa Cruz; AURIOLES-GAMBOA, D., ZAVALA-GONZALEZ, A., Algunos factores ecologicos que determinan la distribucion y abundancia del lobo marino Zalophus californianus, en el Golfo de California.
