The results indicate that over the last 150 years, the EASM circulation and precipitation, indicated by the temperature contrast between the East Asian mainland and adjacent oceans, had a significant decadal perturbation and have been weaker during the period of rapid global warming over the past 50 years. On the centennial time scale, the EASM in the MWP was strongest over the past 1000 years. Over the past 1000 years, the EASM was weakest in 1450-1570. When the EASM circulation was weaker, the monsoon rain belt over eastern China was generally located more southward, with there being less precipitation in North China and more precipitation in the Yangtze River valley; therefore, there was an anomalous pattern of southern flood/northern drought. From the 1900s to 1920s, precipitation had a pattern opposite to that of the southern flood/northern drought, with there being less precipitation in the Yangtze River valley and more precipitation in North China. Compared with the case for the MWP, there was a longer-time-scale southern flood/northern drought phenomenon in 1400-1600. Moreover, the EASM circulation and precipitation did not synchronously vary with the trend of global temperature. During the last 150 years, although the annual mean surface temperature around the world and in China has increased, the EASM circulation and precipitation did not have strengthening or weakening trends. Over the past 1000 years, the weakest EASM occurred ahead of the lowest Northern Hemispheric temperature and corresponded to the weakest solar irradiance. © The Author(s) 2011.","decadal-centennial-scale variability; East Asian monsoon; Little Ice Age; Medieval Warm Period; present climate",,,,,,,"Zhu, K.Z., Preliminary research on climatic variation in China over the recent 5000 years (in Chinese) (1973) Sci China, 3, pp. 168-189; Zheng, J.Y., Zheng, S.Z., An analysis on cold/warm and dry/wet in Shandong Province during historical times (in Chinese) (1993) Acta Geogr Sin, 48, pp. 348-357; Yao, T.D., Climatic and environmental record in the past about 2000 years from the Guliya ice core (in Chinese) (1997) Quat Sci, 17, pp. 52-61; Yang, B., Shi, Y.F., Li, H.P., Some advances in climatic change over the past two millennia (in Chinese) (2002) Adv Earth Sci, 17, pp. 110-117; Yang, B., Braeuning, A., Temperature variations on the Tibetan Plateau during the last millennium (in Chinese) (2006) Adv Clim Change Res, 2, pp. 104-107; Ge, Q.S., Zheng, J.Y., Man, Z.M., Reconstruction and analysis on the series of winter-half-year temperature changes over the past 2000 years in eastern China (in Chinese) (2002) Earth Sci Front, 9, pp. 169-181; Ren, G.Y., Chun, Z.Y., Zhou, Y.Q., Recent progresses in studies of regional temperature changes in China (in Chinese) (2005) Clim Environ Res, 10, pp. 701-716; Li, M.Q., Jin, H.L., Zhang, H., Advances of climate research in the Little Ice Age (in Chinese) (2005) J Desert Res, 25, pp. 731-737; Wang, S.W., Ye, J.L., Gong, D.Y., Climate in China during ice age (1998) Quat Sci, 18, pp. 54-64; Wang, S.W., Chinese climate changes (2005) Evolution and Prediction of Climate and Environment in Evolution of Chinese Climate and Environment, pp. 63-103. , D.
