This paper reports results of a study of the relationship between SST and observed typhoon activity (which is used as a proxy for the intensity of TCs averaged over a season) over the western North Pacific (WNP) for the past 40 yr. The average typhoon activity over a season is found to have no significant relationship with SST in the WNP but increases when the SST over the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean is above normal. The mean annual typhoon activity is generally higher (lower) during an El Niño (La Niña) year. Such interannual variations of typhoon activity appear to be largely constrained by the large-scale atmospheric factors that are closely related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. These large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic factors include low-level relative vorticity, vertical wind shear, and moist static energy. Such results are shown to be physically consistent with one another and with those from previous studies on the interannual variations of TC activity. The results emphasize the danger of drawing conclusions about future TC intensity based on current climate model simulations that are not designed to make such predictions. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climatology; Computer simulation; Oceanography; Storms; Thermodynamics; Wind; Climate models; Sea surface temperature (SST); Tropical cyclones (TC); Vorticity; Global warming; climate change; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; sea surface temperature; typhoon; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); World",,,,,,"Alexander, M.A., Bladé, I., Newman, M., Lanzante, J.R., Lau, N.C., Scott, J.D., The atmospheric bridge: The influence of ENSO teleconnections on air-sea interaction over the global oceans (2002) J.
