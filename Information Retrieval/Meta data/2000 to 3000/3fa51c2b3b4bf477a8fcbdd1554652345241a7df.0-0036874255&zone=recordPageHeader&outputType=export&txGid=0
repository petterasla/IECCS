It was 0.43°C above the 1961-1990 global average, just behind the record of 1998 with its 0.59°C above the normal. In parallel, CO2 has increased from 280 to 370 ppmv since the Industrial Revolution, at a rate 100 times faster than over the last 20,000 years. In its Third Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states clearly that ""an increasing body of observations give a collective picture of a wanning world and other changes in the climate system"" and that ""there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities"". Comparison of model results with present-day climatic observations and past climate reconstructions allows to conclude that the models capture relatively well both the natural climatic variations and the impact of man?s activities on climate. This makes possible to draw conclusions from modeling results obtained for the next century. The globally averaged surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 to 5.8°C over the period 1990 to 2100 and sea level to rise by 9 to 88 cm for the full range of the IPCC scenarios.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Earth (planet); Meteorology; Temperature measurement; Natural climatic variations; Surface temperature; Global warming",,,,,,"Jones, P.D., New, M., Parker, D.E., Martin, S., Rigor, G., (1999) Reviews of Geophysics, 37 (2), pp. 173-199; Mann, M.E., Bradley, R.S., Hughes, M.K., (1999) Geophysical Research Letters, 26 (6), pp. 759-762; Pollack, H.N., Huang, S., Shen, P.Y., (1998) Science, 282, pp. 279-281; Henson, R., (1999) Weatherwise, pp. 34-37. , March/April; WMO statement on the status of the global climate in 2001 (2002) WMO, (940). , WMO; (World Meteorological Organization, Geneva); Keeling, C.D., Whorf, T.P., Atmospheric CO2 records from sites in the SIO air sampling network (2002) Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change, , (Oak Ridge, Tennessee: Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory); Petit, J.R., Basile, I., Leruyuet, A., Raynaud, D., Lorius, C., Jouzel, J., Stievenard, M., Kotlyakov, V., (1997) Nature, 387 (6631), pp. 359-360; Hansen, J., Mki, S., Lacis, A., Ruedy, R., Tegen, I., Matthews, E., (1998) Proc.
