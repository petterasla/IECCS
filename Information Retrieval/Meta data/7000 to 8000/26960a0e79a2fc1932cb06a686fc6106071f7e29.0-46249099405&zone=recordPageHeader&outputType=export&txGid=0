An optimized tire rolling resistance contributes to fuel efficiency. In this respect, steps of the developmental work leading to a new modified SSBR grade are discussed. The new SSBR enables a significant improvement of the tire rolling resistance, identified as 37 percent decrease of the tan δ @ 60°C. In addition, beneficial heat built up, abrasion and ice grip characteristics (measured as tan δ @ -10 °C) were found.","Chain-end functionalisation; Functionalised rubber; Polymer-filler interaction; Rolling resistance; Synthetic rubber Vulcanizates","Fuel pricing; polymer functionalization; tire treads; Global warming; Energy conservation",,,,,,"Quirk, R.P., Comprehensive Polymer Science (1992) First Supplement, p. 83. , Pergamon Press: Oxford, UK; Hsieh, H.L., Ouirk, R.P., (1996) Anionic Polymerization: Principles and Practical Applications, , Marcel Dekker: New York; E.J.Goethals, Ed.Telechelic Polymers: Synthesis and Applications; CRC Press: Boca Raton, Fl, 1989","Thiele, S.; Dow Olefinverbund GmbH, R and D Synthetic Rubber, PF 1163, 06201 Merseburg, Germany; email: ssthiele@dow.com",,,,,,,,09483276,,KGUKA,,"English","KGK Kautsch.
