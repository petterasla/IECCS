The number of WPG facilities domestically as of 2005 was 286. Power generation capacity attained 1,515 MW and power generation 7,050 GWh/year. This amount substitutes energy otherwise acquired from natural resources such as fossil fuels in thermal power plants. If the basic unit of carbon dioxide is 0.555 kg-CO 2/kWh, then the corresponding carbon dioxide emission reduction is calculated to be 3.9 million tons, equivalent to 26.7% of the 14.6 million tons emitted by municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI) in 2005. Using various existing technological options, the power generation efficiency could reach more than 20% in MSWI facilities with capacity of 300 tons/day, although present efficiency is only 12.0%. If about 85% of MSW were incinerated in MSWI with power generation efficiency of 20% as a feasible assumption, the total power generation and the corresponding carbon dioxide reduction would be 16,540 GWh/year and 9.18 million tons, respectively, equivalent to 62.7% of the carbon dioxide emitted by MSWI. Also, the ratio of the additional reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by WPG to the total additional reduction (20,000 ktons/year) in Japan during the first commitment period would be 26.3%, suggesting that promotion of WPG in MSWI is an effective option for prevention of global warming. © 2011 Springer.","Global warming prevention; Heat recovery; Indirect reduction of carbon dioxide emissions; Municipal solid waste incineration; Waste to power generation",,,,,,,"(2006) State of discharge and treatment of municipal solid waste in FY 2005, 2007, , Ministry of the Environment, Japan.
