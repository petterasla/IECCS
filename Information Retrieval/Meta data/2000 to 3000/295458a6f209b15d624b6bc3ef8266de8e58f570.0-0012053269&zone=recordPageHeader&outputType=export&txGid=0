Compared to the former, the surface forcing for some greenhouse gases is reduced by the interference of water vapour. Hence, we calculate alternative surface global warming potentials (SGWPs) that are derived from the surface forcing radiation of greenhouse gases for potential use in surface radiative energy balance models (SREBMs). For gases with a large water vapour overlap, the SGWPs are typically 30% smaller than current GWPs; for gases with relatively little overlap, the SGWPs are larger by more than 33%. These results may be used in conjunction with SREBMs as an additional means of calculating climate change, and may lead to an altered emissions budget compared to that outlined by the current Kyoto agreement. © 2001 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate forcing; Climate model; Greenhouse gas; GWP; Radiative forcing; Surface energy balance model",,,,,,,"Anderson, G.P., Clough, S.A., Kneizys, F.X., Chetwynd, J.H., Shettle, E.P., (1986) AFGL Atmospheric Constituent Profiles (0-120 Km); Clough, S.A., Kneizys, F.X., Anderson, G.P., Shettle, E.P., Chetwynd, J.H., Abreu, L.W., Hall, L.A., IRS '88: Current problems in atmospheric radiation (1988) A.
