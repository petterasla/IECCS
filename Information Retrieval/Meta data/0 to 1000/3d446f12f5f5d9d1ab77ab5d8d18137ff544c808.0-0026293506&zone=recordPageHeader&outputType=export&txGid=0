T6G 2E9, Canada","In the two years after treatments were applied to seasonally flooded vegetation zones in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Alberta,a drought treatment did not significantly change stem density and height of the dominant hygrophytes Calamagrostis canadensis and Carex atherodes. Dicotyledonous species' density and richness increased 3- to 36-fold on soil blocks moved upslope to the driest vegetation zone relative to unmoved soil blocks. The percent cover of native dicotyledonous species was unaffected but that of xerophytic Eurasian species, Sonchus arvensis and Cirsium arvense, increased 5- to 13-fold after drought treatment. Fire, particularly the deepest burn, reduced graminoid density and height up to 90%. Dicotyledon density, but not richness, was generally higher after fire. Plant cover was unaffected by fire but Eurasian species' cover was still 3- to 15-fold greater than that of native species. Seasonally flooded vegetation zones will likely be shifted from flood-driven dynamics with cool and moist environmental conditions towards drought- and fire-driven dynamics with warmer and drier conditions. -from Authors",,"climatic change; drought; fire; wetland; Canada, Alberta, Peace-Athabasca Delta; Calamagrostis canadensis; Carex atherodes; Cirsium; Cirsium arvense; eudicotyledons; Sonchus; Sonchus arvensis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026293506
