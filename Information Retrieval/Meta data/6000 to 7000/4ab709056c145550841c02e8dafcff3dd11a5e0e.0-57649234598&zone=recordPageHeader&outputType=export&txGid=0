Energy system in China has various stakeholders, and how to straighten out the responsibility, power and benefit of the stakeholders has been one of the key issues for the construction of sustainable energy system. According to Stakeholder Theory, the stakeholders of energy system in China and their interest requirements were systematically analyzed, and the driving force model for the construction of sustainable energy system in China was established, on basis of which the countermeasures were proposed that a new government-dominated energy management mode based on stakeholders' participation should be set up, in which the sync coordinate development of the stakeholders would be realized. © 2008 IEEE.","Countermeasure; Driving force model; Energy system; Interest requirement; Stakeholder","Energy management; Management science; Planning; Strategic planning; Countermeasure; Driving force model; Energy system; Interest requirement; Stakeholder; Energy conservation",,,,,,"Fang, Y.P., Zeng, Y., Balancing energy and environment: The effect and perspective of management instruments in China[J] (2007) Energy, 32 (12), pp. 2247-2261; Gan, L., Energy development and environmental constraints in China[J] (1998) Energy Policy, 26 (2), pp. 119-128; Wang, X.H., Feng, Z.M., Energy consumption with sustainable development in developing country: A case in Jiangsu, China[J] (2003) Energy Policy, 31 (15), pp. 1679-1684; Ni, W.D., Johansson, T.B., Energy for sustainable development in China[J] (2004) Energy Policy, 32 (10), pp. 1225-1229; Huang, L.M., Haque, E., Barg, S., Public policy discourse, planning and measures toward sustainable energy strategies in Canada[J] (2008) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 12 (1), pp. 91-115; Vera, I., Langlois, L., Energy indicators for sustainable development[J] (2007) Energy, 32 (6), pp. 875-882; Streimikiene, D., Klevas, V., Bubeliene, J., Use of EU structural funds for sustainable energy development in new EU member states [J] (2007) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 11 (6), pp. 1167-1187; Omer, A.M., Energy, environment and sustainable development[J].
