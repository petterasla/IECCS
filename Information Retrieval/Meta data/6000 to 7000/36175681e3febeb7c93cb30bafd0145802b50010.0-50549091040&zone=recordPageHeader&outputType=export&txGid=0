Even if a shape memory alloy is bent at normal temperature, when it is warmed, it has the character that it returns to the original straight form. Using this character of a shape memory alloy, unused thermal energy will be able to transform into rotation energy, and finally it can change into electric energy. We solved this energy conversion mechanism and the validity of this theory was indirectly verified by experiment. Furthermore, the power generation characteristic of the Shape Memory Alloy Engine was obtained by experiment. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Energy conversion; New power generation system; Shape memory alloy; SMA engine; Unused thermal energy","Computer networks; Energy conversion; Global warming; Shape memory effect; Thermography (temperature measurement); New power generation system; Shape memory alloy; SMA engine; Unused thermal energy; Alloys",,,,,,"Shimada, R., (2002) Illustrated power engineering: Power production, transmission, and storage, , Maruzen:, in Japanese; Honma, T., (1986) Application and development of shape memory alloys, pp. 293-301. , SDC;, in Japanese; Miyazaki, S., (2001) Features and application of shape memory alloys, pp. 220-225. , CMC;, in Japanese; Tanaka, K., (1993) Mechanical properties of shape memory alloys, , Yokendo;, in Japanese; Suzuki, Y., (1987) Shape memory alloys for practical application, , Kogyo Chosakai;, in Japanese; Ishikawa, S., (1987) Ideas for application of shape memory alloys, , Kogyo Chosakai;, in Japanese; Ginell, W.S., McNichols Jr, J.L., Cory, J.S., Nitinol heat engines for low-grade thermal energy conversion (1979) Mech Eng, 101, pp. 26-33; Tobushi, H., Cahoon, J.R., Mechanical analysis of a solar-powered solid state engine (1985) Trans Can Soc Mech Eng, 9, pp. 137-141; Iwanaga, H., Tobushi, H., Ito, H., Basic research (1987) output power characteristic of shape memory alloy heat engine (1st Report).
