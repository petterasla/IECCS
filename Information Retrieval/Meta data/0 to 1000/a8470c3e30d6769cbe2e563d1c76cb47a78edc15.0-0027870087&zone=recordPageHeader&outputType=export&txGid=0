The large-scale North Atlantic sea level pressure (SLP) is related to the regional, variable, winter (DJF) mean Iberian Peninsula rainfall. The skill of the resulting statistical model is shown by reproducing, to a good approximation, the winter mean Iberian rainfall from 1900 to present from the observed North Atlantic mean SLP distributions. It is shown that this observed relationship between these two variables is not well reproduced in the output of a general circulation model (GCM). The implications for Iberian rainfall changes as the response to increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations simulated by two GCM experiments are examined. -from Authors",,"climate change; general circulation model; rainfall; regional scale; wintertime; Europe, Iberian Peninsula",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08948755,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027870087
