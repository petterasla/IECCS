It has, for example, been suggested that the locations of ecotones, transitions between adjacent ecosystems or biomes, should be monitored. It is assumed that changes in climate, especially increases in atmospheric temperature, will result in shifts in the location (altitude or latitude) of ecotones as plants respond to the newly imposed climatic conditions. In this article, we address the use of two montane ecotones, the alpine tree-line ecotone and the deciduous/Boreal forest ecotone, in monitoring global climatic change. In so doing, we 1) outline the factors that create and maintain each ecotone's position at a given location; 2) assess the projected response of the ecotones to various aspects of global warming; and 3) discuss the usefulness of both ecotones as indicators of global climate change. While it is likely that extended periods of directional climate change would bring about an altitudinal shift in the ranges of montane species and the associated ecotones, we question whether the response at either ecotone will be at a timescale useful for detecting climate change (a few decades) owing to disequilibrium related to upslope edaphic limitations and competitive interactions with established canopy and subcanopy individuals. Further, limitations related to the prediction of the complex and interacting effects of projected changes in temperature, precipitation and site water balance on photosynthetic processes of plant species raise uncertainties about the expected responses of both ecotones.","Alpine tree-line; Boreal; Climate change; Deciduous; Disequilibrium; Ecotones; Lag time","alpine ecotone; boreal ecotone; climate change; ecotone",,,,,,"Airey, M., Hulme, M., Evaluating climate model simulations of precipitation: Methods, problems and performance (1995) Progress in Physical Geography, 19, pp. 427-448; Armand, A.D., Sharp and gradual mountain timberlines as a result of species interaction (1992) Landscape Boundaries: Consequences for Biotic Diversity and Ecological Flows, pp. 360-378. , Hansen, A.J. and di Castri, F., editors, New York: Springer-Verlag; Arris, L.L., Eagleson, P.S., Evidence of a physiological basis for the Boreal-deciduous forest ecotone in North America (1989) Vegetatio, 82, pp. 55-58; A water use model for locating the Boreal/deciduous forest ecotone in eastern North America (1994) Water Resources Research, 30, pp. 1-9; Barbour, M.G., Berg, N.H., Kittel, T.G.F., Kunz, M.E., Snowpack and the distribution of a major vegetation ecotone in the Sierra Nevada of California (1991) Journal of Biogeography, 18, pp. 141-144; Barbour, M.G., Burk, J.H., Pitts, W.D., (1987) Terrestrial Plant Ecology, , Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings; Barry, R.G., Fallot, J.-M., Armstrong, R.L., Twentieth-century variability in snowcover conditions and approaches to detecting and monitoring changes: Status and prospects (1995) Progress in Physical Geography, 19, pp. 520-532; Bormann, F.H., Siccama, T.G., Likens, G.E., Whittaker, R.H., The Hubbard Brook ecosystem study; composition and dynamics of the tree stratum (1970) Ecological Monographs, 40, pp. 373-388; Burke, M.J., Gusta, L.V., Quamme, H.A., Weiser, C.J., Li, P.H., Freezing and injury in plants (1976) Annual Review of Plant Physiology, 27, pp. 507-528; Busing, R.T., White, P.S., MacKenzie, M.D., Gradient analysis of old spruce-fir forests of the Great Smoky Mountains circa 1935 (1993) Canadian Journal of Botany, 71, pp. 951-958; Butler, D.R., Malanson, G.P., Cairns, D.M., Stability of alpine treeline in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA (1994) Phytocoenologia, 22, pp. 485-500; Cain, S.A., Ecological studies of the vegetation of the Great Smokey Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee. 1.
