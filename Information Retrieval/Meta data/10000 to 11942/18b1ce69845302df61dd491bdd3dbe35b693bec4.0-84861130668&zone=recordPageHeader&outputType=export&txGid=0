Energy is not only a measurement for economical and social improvement but also a fundamental human necessity. Every country in the planet are trying to find a way to solve energy problems such as depending on energy importation, all kind of environmental pollution, global warming, increasing cost of energy, and energy inefficiency. Industrial and technologic developments are continuing rapidly, the need of energy consuming is increasing accordingly, and also concerning the population increase; the governments are given vast amount of incentives for renewable energy for the solutions to these kinds of problems and for the aims to be realized, which are saving money, saving energy and therefore saving the world. In this study, recent renewable energy developments, the evaluation of renewable energy, the importance of renewable energy use, the incentives and subsidies, the renewable energy policies in Turkey are investigated. In this regard some barriers and recommendations are submitted. © Sila Science.","Renewable energy; Renewable energy incentives; Renewable energy policies; Turkey","Energy problem; Environmental pollutions; Human lives; Renewable energies; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy policy; Saving energy; Turkey; Energy policy; Global warming; Renewable energy resources",,,,,,"(2010) UCTEA, Union of Turkish Chambers of Mechanical Engineers and Architects report, , The energy outlook of Turkey, Issue No: MMO/2010/528, March, [in Turkish]; Kaya, D., Renewable energy policies in Turkey (2006) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 10, pp. 152-163; http://www.eca.gov.ukhttp://www.therenewableenergycente.co.uk/grants/Canka Kilic, F., Kaya, D., Energy production, consumption, policies, and recent developments in Turkey (2007) Renew Sustain Energy R, 11, pp. 1312-1320; Koyun, A., (2007) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, , Turkey-National study's summary.
