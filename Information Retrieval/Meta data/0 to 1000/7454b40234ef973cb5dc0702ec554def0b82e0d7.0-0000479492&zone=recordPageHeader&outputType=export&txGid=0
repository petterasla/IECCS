Data obtained with a grating spectrometer, which has wide spectral coverage and adequate spectral resolution (0.4 cm-1), are compared with the so-called NCAR cross-sections that have recently been introduced into the HITRAN Tape. We have also performed measurements, at various temperature-pressure combinations which are chosen to represent tangent heights (as in solar-occultation experiments) or layers in the atmosphere, of the kv of CFC-12 in the 921 and 923 cm-1 Q-branches and at 924.1, 927.6, 931.6 935.0 and 1106 cm-1 with the Doppler-limited spectral resolution (∼10-4cm-1) of a tunable-diode laser spectrometer. The latter are especially well suited for atmospheric remote sensing, while the grating spectra are useful in global warming studies. The effects of temperature and pressure on the spectral absorption coefficients are discussed. © 1992.",,,,,,,,"Herranz, de la Cierva, Morcillo, (1959) A. R. Soc. Esp. Fis. Quim.
