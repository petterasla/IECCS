However, it also brought with it an unforeseen impact on the environment. Aviation currently contributes to about 3·5% of the global wanning attributed from human activities. With the forecasted rate of growth, this is expected to rise to about 15% over the next 50 years. Although it is projected that the annual improvements in aircraft fuel efficiency are of the order of 1-2%, it is suggested that the current gas turbine design is fully exploited and further improvements are difficult to achieve. A new generation of aero engine core concepts that can operate at higher thermal efficiencies and lower emissions is required. One possibility of achieving higher core efficiencies is through the use of an intercooled (IC) core at high overall pressure ratios (OPR). The concept engine, expected to enter into service around 2020, will make use of a conventional heat exchanger (HEX) for the intercooler. This paper seeks to introduce a heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHEX) as an alternative design of the intercooler. The proposed HPHEX design takes advantage of the convenience of the geometry of miniature heat pipes to provide a reduction in pressure losses and weight when compared to conventional HEX. The HPHEX will be made of a number of stages, each stage being made of a large number of miniature heat pipes in radial configuration, that will extend from the inter-compressor duct to the bypass split, thus eliminating any ducting to and from the intercooler. This design offers up to 32% reduction in hot pressure losses, 34% reduction in cold pressure losses and over 41% reduction in weight.",,"Aero engine parts; Aero-engine; Alternative designs; Ducting; Fuel efficiency; Gas turbine design; Hot pressure; Human activities; Impact on the environment; Intercooled; Intercoolers; Miniature heat pipes; Novel concept; Overall pressure ratios; Pressure loss; Radial configuration; Thermal efficiency; Aircraft engines; Aviation; Bypass ratio; Centrifugal compressors; Efficiency; Heat pipes; Design",,,,,,"Birch, N.T., 2020 vision: The prospects for large civil aircraft propulsion (2000) Aeronautical Journal, 104 (1038), pp. 347-352; Boggia, S., Intercooled recuperated aero engine (2002) MTU GmbH Report; Caniere, H., Willockx, A., Dick, E., De Paepe, M., Raising cycle efficiency by intercooling in air-cooled gas turbines (2006) Applied Thermal Engineering, 26 (16), pp. 1780-1787. , DOI 10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2006.02.008, PII S1359431106000421; (1991) Winners: Hans von Ohain and Frank Whittle, , http://www.draperprize.org/1991.php, Charles Stark Draper prize; Da Cunha Alves, M., De Franca Mendes Carneiro, H., Barbosa, J., Travieso, L., Pilidis, P., Ramsden, K., An insight on intercooling and reheat gas turbine cycles (2001) Proc Inst Meeh Eng, 215 (2 PART A), pp. 163-171; Horlock, J.H., Watson, D.T., Jones, T.V., Limitations of gas turbine performance imposed by large turbine cooling flows (2001) Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, 123 (3), pp. 487-494. , DOI 10.1115/1.1373398; Kang, H., (1997) Heat Transfer Characteristics of Heat Pipe Heat Exchangers for Low and Medium Temperature Heat Recovery, , MPhil Thesis, Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK; Kays, W.M., London, A.L., (1998) Compact Heat Exchangers, , 3rd ed, Krieger Publishing Company, Malabar, Florida, USA; Kyprianidis, K.G., Groenstedt, T., Ogaji, S., Pilidis, P., Singh, R., Assessment of future aero-engine designs with intercooled and intercooled recuperated cores (2011) ASME J Eng Gas Turbines and Power, p. 133. , January; Kurzke, J., Achieving maximum thermal efficiency with the simple gas turbine cycle (2003) Joachim Kurzke 9th CEAS European Propulsion Forum: Virtual Engine - A Challenge for Integrated Computer Modelling, , 15-17 October, Roma, Italy; Kurzke, J., GasTurb, 2007, , http://www.gasturb.de; Lundbladh, A., Sjunnesson, A., Heat exchanger weight and efficiency Impact on jet engine transport applications (1122) 16th ISABE Conference, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Marx, M., (2007) Investigation and Optimisation of Intercooling in an IRA Engine, , MSc Thesis, Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK; Metz, B., Davidson, O.R., Bosch, P.R., Dave, R., Meyer, L.A., (2007) Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press; Papadopoulos, T., Pilidis, P., (2000) Introduction to Intercooling in A High Bypass Jet Engine, ASME Turbo Expo, , May 2000, Munich, Germany; Penner, J.E., Lister, D.H., Griggs, D.J., Dokken, D.J., McFarland, M., (1999) Aviation and the Global Atmosphere, IPCC, , http://www.ipcc.cn/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.htm, Eds; Peretz, R., Relation between evaporator and condenser lengths of a finless heat pipe to achieve a maximum heat flow per unit weight (1982) Int J Heat and Fluid Flow, 3 (3), p. 147. , 148; Rolt, A., Baker, N.J., (2009) Intercooled Turbofan Engine Design and Technology Research in the EU, , Rolls Royce Pic Report; Saidi, A., Eriksson, D., Sunden, B., Analysis of Some Heat Exchanger Concepts for Use as Gas Turbine Intercoolers (2002) International Journal of Heat Exchangers, 3 (2), pp. 241-260; Silverstein, C.C., (1992) Design and Technology of Heat Pipes for Cooling and Heat Exchange, , Hemisphere Pub.
