To accomplish this we independently surveyed the coauthors of this paper to produce a list of candidate ecosystems, and then refined this list during a 2-day workshop. The list includes (1) elevationally restricted mountain ecosystems, (2) tropical savannas, (3) coastal floodplains and wetlands, (4) coral reefs, (5) drier rainforests, (6) wetlands and floodplains in the Murray-Darling Basin, (7) the Mediterranean ecosystems of southwestern Australia, (8) offshore islands, (9) temperate eucalypt forests, and (10) salt marshes and mangroves. Some of these ecosystems are vulnerable to widespread phase-changes that could fundamentally alter ecosystem properties such as habitat structure, species composition, fire regimes, or carbon storage. Others appear susceptible to major changes across only part of their geographic range, whereas yet others are susceptible to a large-scale decline of key biotic components, such as small mammals or stream-dwelling amphibians. For each ecosystem we consider the intrinsic features and external drivers that render it susceptible to tipping points, and identify subtypes of the ecosystem that we deem to be especially vulnerable. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Catastrophes; Climatic change; Ecological resilience; Ecological thresholds; Exotic pests and pathogens; Feral animals; Fire regimes; Global warming; Habitat fragmentation; Invasive species; Salinization; Sea-level rise; Species extinctions","catastrophic event; climate change; community composition; coral reef; ecosystem health; ecosystem resilience; environmental degradation; environmental disturbance; extinction risk; feral organism; floodplain; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; habitat structure; invasive species; mangrove; Mediterranean environment; mountain environment; pathogen; pest species; population decline; rainforest; salinization; saltmarsh; savanna; sea level change; threshold; vulnerability; wetland; wildfire; Australia; Amphibia; Animalia; Anthozoa; Mammalia; Rhizophoraceae",,,,,,"Abbott, I., Le Maitre, D., Monitoring the impact of climate change on biodiversity: the challenge of megadiverse Mediterranean climate ecosystems (2010) Austral Ecology, 35, pp. 406-422; Adam, P., Wetlands and wetland boundaries: problems, expectations, perceptions and reality (1992) Wetlands, 10, pp. 60-67; Armitage, D., Plummer, R., Berkes, F., Arthur, R., Charles, A., Davidson-Hunt, I., Diduck, A., Wollenberg, E., Adaptive co-management for social-ecological complexity (2009) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 7, pp. 95-102; (2010), http://www.australianwildlife.org/images/file/Northern_Mammal_WM_Winter_2010_-lowres.pdf, AWC, Where Have All the Mammals Gone?
