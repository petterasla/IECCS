Vulnerability to climate change is determined by a community's ability to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from the impact of major weather events. Climate change will affect industrial and agricultural sectors, as well as transportation, health, and energy infrastructure. These shifts will have significant health and economic consequences for diverse communities throughout California. Without proactive policies to address these equity concerns, climate change will likely reinforce and amplify current as well as future socioeconomic disparities, leaving low-income, minority, and politically marginalized groups with fewer economic opportunities and more environmental and health burdens. This review explores the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups in California and investigates the costs and benefits of the climate change mitigation strategies specified for implementation in the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32). Lastly, knowledge gaps, future research priorities, and policy implications are identified. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Agricultural sector; California; Climate change mitigation; Costs and benefits; Diverse community; Economic consequences; Economic opportunities; Energy infrastructures; Environmental health; Human rights; Knowledge gaps; Mitigation policies; Policy implications; Public health; Research priorities; Weather events; Global warming; Public policy; Health; climate change; climate effect; cost-benefit analysis; environmental impact; environmental policy; equity; human rights; literature review; mitigation; public health; socioeconomic impact; vulnerability; California; United States",,,,,,"Ackerman, F., Stanton, E., (2008) The Cost of Climate Change: What We'll Pay If Global Warming Continues Unchecked, , New York: NRDC; 2007 American community survey 1-year estimates (2007) American Community Survey, , http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=05000US06037&-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_DP3&-context=adp&-ds_name=&-tree_id=307&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-format=, ACS; (2011) State of the Air: 2011, , ALA, American Lung Association, New York, NY; Bailey, D., Knowlton, K., Rotkin-Ellman, M., (2008) Boosting the Benefits: Improving Air Quality and Health by Reducing Global Warming Pollution in California, , NRDC, New York: Natural Recources Defense Council; Basu, R., Ostro, B.D., A multicounty analysis identifying the populations vulnerable to mortality associated with high ambient temperature in California (2008) Am J Epidemiol, 168 (6), pp. 632-637; Basu, R., Feng, W.Y., Ostro, B.D., Characterizing temperature and mortality in nine California counties (2008) Epidemiology, 19 (1), pp. 138-145; Blaikie, P., Cannon, T., Davis, I., Wisner, B., (1994) At Risk: Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability, and Disasters, , New York: Routledge; (2002) Consumer Expenditure Survey, , BLS, Washington: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Bolin, R., Bolton, P., (1986) Race, Religion, and Ethnicity in Disaster Recovery, Program on Environment and Behavior, , Boulder: University of Colorado, Institute of Behavioral Science, Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center; (2006), CARB, Assembly Bill No. 32: California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006(2006) Emission Reduction Plan For Ports and Goods Movement In California, , CARB, Sacramento; (2008) Methodology for Estimating Premature Deaths Associated with Long-Term Exposures to Fine Airborne Particulate Matter in California, , CARB, Sacramento: California Air Resources Board; (2008) Climate Change Draft Scoping Plan: A Framework for Change.
