The output of a dynamic system model is used in the LEAP model and overall energy balances are then compiled using a bottom-up approach. Biomass fuels constitute the major energy sources for rural people. A major share of the fuel is consumed for cooking using traditional stoves which have an efficiency less than 10%. Most of the biomass comes from crop wastes. Conservative estimates show tremendous pressure on rural forests for fuelwood. As the result, there is overcutting of rural forests resulting in environmental degradation. Bangladesh is responsible for a small fraction of the total anthropogenic contribution of CO2 but could be seriously affected by climatic change. Energy planning for sustainable development with LEAP is made more effective by using a complementary dynamic system model.",,"biomass energy; bottom-up approach; carbon dioxide emissions; carbon emissions; climatic impact; developing country; energy demand; energy planning; energy supply; fuelwood harvesting; modelling approach; rural energy supply; rural energy system; Bangladesh",,,,,,"(1987) Final Report, 1-4. , Ministry of Planning, Govt. of Bangladesh, Dhaka; Lazarus, M., Heaps, C., Raskin, P., (1995) LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System), , Stockholm Environmental Institute, Boston; Baughman, M.L., Hnyilicza, E., (1975) Proc.
