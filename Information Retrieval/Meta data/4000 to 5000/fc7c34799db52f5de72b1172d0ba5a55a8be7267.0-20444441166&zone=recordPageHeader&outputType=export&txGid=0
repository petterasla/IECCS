Upper/lower thermal limits for 10 species of sessile/sedentary invertebrates were established on a single rocky shore. Two species with different reproductive strategies (Littorina littorea, Nucella lapillus) from 3 Scottish and 3 Irish shores were investigated to test effects of small scale (<10 km) or larger scale (ca. 500 km) distances, and shore height on upper lethal temperature. At 3 sheltered and 3 exposed shores in Ireland, thermal responses of N. lapillus from the middle of their vertical distribution were compared. Amongst the 10 species from a single shore, thermal niche width rose asymptotically with maximum height of distribution on the shore and maximum emersion time. Median upper lethal temperature and median lower lethal temperature were closely correlated. For 8 species on the middle and upper shore, there were significant linear relationships between shore height and the variables upper lethal temperature, lower lethal temperature and thermal niche width. L. littorea upper lethal temperature was found not to vary with shore height, varied little over small geographical distances, but was significantly higher in Ireland than in Scotland. N. lapillus upper lethal temperature was higher in animals collected from the upper limit of distribution on the shore than in dogwhelks from the lower limit of distribution, was higher in animals taken from sheltered shores than from exposed shores and showed significant local differences. Upper lethal temperature was higher in Scottish than Irish dogwhelks. © Inter-Research 2005.","Intertidal invertebrates; Littorina; Nucella; Thermal niche","rocky shore; spatial distribution; temperature; vertical distribution; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Ireland; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World; Animalia; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Littorina; Littorina littorea; Nucella; Nucella lapillus",,,,,,"Clarke, A.P., Mill, P.J., Grahame, J., McMahon, R.F., Geographical variation in heat coma temperatures in Littorina species (Mollusca: Gastropoda) (2000) J Mar Biol Assoc UK, 80, pp. 855-863; Connell, J.H., Effects of competition, predation by Thais lapillus, and other factors on natural populations of the barnacle Balanus balanoides (1961) Ecol Monogr, 31, pp. 61-104; Connell, J.H., The influence of interspecific competition and other factors on the distribution of the barnacle Chthamalus stellatus (1961) Ecology, 42, pp. 710-723; Crisp, D.J., The effects of the severe winter of 1962-63 on marine life in Britain (1964) J Anim Ecol, 33, pp. 165-210; Davenport, J., Environmental simulation experiments on marine and estuarine organisms (1982) Adv Mar Biol, 19, pp. 133-256; Davenport, J., (1992) Animal Life at Low Temperature, , Chapman & Hall, London; Davenport, J., MacAlister, H., Environmental conditions and physiological tolerances of intertidal fauna in relation to shore zonation at Husvik, South Georgia (1996) J Mar Biol Assoc UK, 76, pp. 985-1002; Evans, R.G., The lethal temperatures of some common British littoral molluscs (1948) J Anim Ecol, 17, pp. 165-173; Finney, D.J., (1971) Probit Analysis, 3rd Edn., , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Gray, D.R., Hodgson, A.N., The importance of a crevice environment to the limpet Helcion pectunculus (Patellidae) (2004) J Molluscan Stud, 70, pp. 67-72; Harley, C.D.G., Helmuth, B.S.T., Local- and regional-scale effects of wave exposure, thermal stress, and absolute versus effective shore level on patterns of intertidal zonation (2003) Limnol Oceanogr, 48 (4), pp. 1498-1508; Helmuth, B.S.T., Intertidal mussel microclimates: Predicting the body temperature of a sessile invertebrate (1998) Ecol Monogr, 68 (1), pp. 51-74; Helmuth, B.S.T., Thermal biology of rocky intertidal mussels: Quantifying body temperatures using climatological data (1999) Ecology, 80 (1), pp. 15-34; Helmuth, B., Harley, C.D.G., Halpin, P.M., O'Donnell, M., Hofmann, G.E., Blanchette, C.A., Climate change and latitudinal patterns of intertidal thermal stress (2002) Science, 298, pp. 1015-1017; Hiscock, K., (1996) Marine Nature Conservation Review: Rationale and Methods, , Joint Nature Conservation Committee (Coasts and seas of the United Kingdom.
