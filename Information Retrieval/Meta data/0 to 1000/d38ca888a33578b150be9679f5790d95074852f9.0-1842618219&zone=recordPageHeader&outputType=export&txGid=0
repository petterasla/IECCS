It is estimated that the feedback strength is about 20% (10%-50%) of that which would be necessary to completely counteract a perturbation to the global climate, such as is anticipated due to accumulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. -from Author",,"climate change; cloud albedo; dimethylsulphide; feedback cycle; marine biogeochemical sulphur cycle; phytoplankton",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842618219
