While tunneling and aerial structures account for only 15% of the route's length, they are responsible for 60% of emissions. Based on estimates of avoided emissions from operation of the system of just over one million metric tons of CO2 per year, construction emissions would be recuperated in about two years and their global warming effect in about six after services begin. This range of recuperation times is relatively short given the long-life of the constructed infrastructure. Avoided emissions estimates are dependent on ridership and if low ridership lead to a 75% decrease in offset emissions, recuperation times may increase to more than 20years. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon footprint; Greenhouse gas emissions; High-speed rail; Life cycle assessment; Tunnel construction","After-service; Avoided emissions; California; Carbon footprint; Construction materials; Greenhouse gas inventory; High-speed rail; Infrastructure construction; Life cycle assessment; San Francisco; Tunnel construction; Carbon dioxide; Estimation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Materials handling; Railroad transportation; Gas emissions; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; high-speed train; infrastructural development; life cycle analysis; quantitative analysis; tunneling; California; San Francisco; United States",,,,,,"(2006), California Air Resources Board, OFFROAD2007, Sacramento, 2. , California Air Resources Board, 2008.
