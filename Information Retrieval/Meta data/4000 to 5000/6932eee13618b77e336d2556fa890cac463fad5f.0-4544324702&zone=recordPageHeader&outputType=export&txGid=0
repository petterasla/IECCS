How can a world of 10 billion people be provided with adequate supplies of energy, cleanly, safely and substantially? There is a growing consensus that renewable energy sources will be a very important part of the answer. The growing interest in renewables has been prompted, in part, by increasing concern over the pollution, resource depletion and possible climate change implications of our continuing use of conventional fossil and nuclear fuels. Recent technological developments have also improved the cost-effectiveness of many of the renewables, making their economic prospects look increasingly attractive. It describes the achievement and progress made in hydropower, biomass conversion, geothermal, solar thermal technology, wind energy conversion, and the increasing usage of photovoltaics. It is evident that global warming is setting in and is going to change the climate, as well as the terrain of many countries, unless drastic measures are taken. The Kyoto meeting emphasized the importance of limiting CO2 emissions and to abide by some form of agreement to reduce emissions. The present study concludes that renewable energy penetration into the energy market is much faster than was expected in recent years and by 2030, 15-20% of our prime energy will be met by renewable energy.","Clean energy; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy; Sustainable future","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gas emissions; Nuclear fuels; Renewable energy resources; Clean energy; Energy market; Energy penetration; Solar thermal technology; Sustainable development",,,,,,"Ackermann, T., Söder, L., Wind energy technology and current status: A review (2000) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 4, pp. 315-374; (2001) Global Wind Energy Market Report, , http://www.awea.org; Brown, C.A., Wind power in China (2001) Refocus, pp. 24-29. , April; (1997) Energy for the Future, Renewable Sources of Energy, , White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan, COM (97) 559, Final Report, Brussels; Hall, D.O., Biomass energy in industrialized countries - A view of the future (1997) Forest Ecology and Management, 91, pp. 17-45; Hutter, G.W., The status of world geothermal power generation 1995-2000 (2001) Geothermics, 30, pp. 1-27; (2002) World Energy Outlook 2002, , Paris: IEA/OECD; (2000) The Evolving Renewable Energy Market, , http://www.iea.org, International Energy Agency.
