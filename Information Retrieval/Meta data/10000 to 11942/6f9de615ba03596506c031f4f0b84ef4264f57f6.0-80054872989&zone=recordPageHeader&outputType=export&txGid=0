Based on it, we analyse combinations of the proposed emission reduction ranges for Annex I countries as a group (25-40% below 1990 levels) and non-Annex I as a group (15-30% below baseline) by 2020 to limit global warming to 2 °C. We use results of the FAIR model with costs estimates based on two energy system models. We conclude that the range of targets that comply with a set of criteria for economic, political and environmental considerations is smaller than that by environmental considerations alone. More specifically, we find that according to our criteria, a 30% Annex I reduction target below 1990 levels, combined with a 20% non-Annex I reduction target below baseline emission levels (i.e. 20 to 30% above 2005 levels), is the only combination of targets fulfilling all our criteria for both energy system models. Otherwise, reaching the 2 °C target becomes less likely, technically infeasible, or non-Annex I abatement costs are likely to exceed those of Annex I, a result, which we consider less plausible from a political viewpoint in our conceptual framework. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Abatement costs; Copenhagen accord; Two degree target","Abatement costs; Conceptual frameworks; Copenhagen; Emission level; Emission reduction; Energy system model; Environmental considerations; Reduction targets; Two degree target; Global warming; Cost benefit analysis; abatement cost; conceptual framework; environmental economics; environmental policy; global warming; numerical model",,,,,,"Anger, N., Sathaye, J.A., Reducing Deforestation and Trading Emissions: Economic Implications for the post-Kyoto Carbon Market (2008), ftp://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp08016.pdf, Discussion Paper No. 08-016, Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), Mannheim, GermanyAmann, M., Rafaj, P., Höhne, N., GHG Mitigation Potentials in Annex I Countries.
