We show that this mechanism requires essentially complete disappearance of network proceeding back in time to the beginning of the 20th century. This disappearance is ruled out by the many Ca K spectroheliograms taken since the discovery of the network in the early 1890's. Furthermore, network area measurements we have carried out on Ca K spectroheliograms digitized from the Mt Wilson and NSO/Sacramento Peak archives, for the nine solar activity minima between 1914 and 1996, show no evidence of network area variations large enough to produce a significant long-term component of total irradiance variation. A network brightness variation of sufficient magnitude is also unlikely, given the linear dependence of solar microwave flux on area of bright structures. More generally, recent analyses of cycle 21,22 pyrheliometry, and of broadband stellar photometry, provide little support for any long-term irradiance component. These results do not out a secular irradiance increase. But they suggest that high climate sensitivity to the relatively small changes in solar total and UV irradiance that have been observed, provides a more likely explanation of the global temperature-solar activity correlation.",,"Global warming; Heliographs; Irradiation; Microwaves; Photometry; Sun; Quiet network areas; Solar activities; Geophysics; climate change; global warming; irradiance; solar radiation",,,,,,"Baliunas, S., Jastrow, R., Evidence for long-term brightness changes of solar-like stars (1990) Nature, 348, pp. 520-523; Beer, J., Tobias, S., Weiss, N., An active sun throughout the maunder minimum (1998) Solar Physics, 181, pp. 237-249; Dere, K., Bartoe, J., Brueckner, G., High resolution observations of the quiet chromosphere and transition region (1994) Astrophys J, 281, pp. 870-883; Foukal, P., Stellar luminosity variations and global warming (1994) Science, 264, pp. 238-239; Foukal, P., The behavior of solar magnetic plages measured from Mt.
