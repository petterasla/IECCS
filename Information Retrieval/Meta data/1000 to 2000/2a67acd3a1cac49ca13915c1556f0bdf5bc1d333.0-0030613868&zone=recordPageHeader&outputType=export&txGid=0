Analyses were made between both the prewinter period and a period of declining abundance immediately after the winters and between this decline period and a later period of recovery in which abundance increased. The proportional declines in abundance showed no relationship to prewinter abundances. Proportional abundance change was greatest at sites closer to the range edge and, for two species, at sites with a more severe winter. Proportional abundance increases of these two species between the decline and recovery periods similarly were greatest at sites near the range edges and with previously more severe winters. Abundance increases were greater at sites with the lowest predecline abundance. Geographic range structures showed changes parallel to the abundance changes, including overall contraction and expansion. In addition, there was evidence of fine-scale range dynamics, including extinction and colonization events toward the range margins and a roughening of the range boundary with abundance decrease followed by a smoothing of the boundary with abundance increase. Periods of major environmental change, such as these severe winters, may provide insight into how populations of organisms will respond to global climate change. In particular, this study suggests that population declines will be accompanied by a contraction toward core areas of the range that formerly had the highest abundance. However, more investigation is clearly needed into the precise nature of broad-scale population dynamics following environmental perturbations that cause abundance change.","Abundance change; Climate change; Geographic range; Passerine birds; Range dynamics","abundance; environmental change; geographical range; population decline; North America",,,,,,"(1983) Check-list of North American Birds, , Allen Press, Lawrence, Kansas, USA; Arcese, P., Smith, J.N.M., Hochachka, W.M., Rogers, C.M., Ludwig, D., Stability, regulation, and the determination of abundance in an insular Song Sparrow population (1992) Ecology, 73, pp. 805-822; Bart, J., Schoultz, J.D., Reliability of singing bird surveys: Changes in observer efficiency with avian density (1984) Auk, 101, pp. 307-318; Bohning-Gaese, K., Taper, M.L., Brown, J.H., Avian community dynamics are discordant in space and time (1994) Oikos, 70, pp. 121-126; Boorman, S.A., Levin, P.R., Group selection on the boundary of a stable population (1973) Theoretical Population Biology, 4, pp. 85-128; Brown, J.H., On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species (1984) American Naturalist, 124, pp. 255-279; (1995) Macroecology, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, USA; Brown, J.H., Mehlman, D.W., Stevens, G.C., Spatial variation in abundance (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 2028-2043; Bystrak, D., The North American Breeding Bird Survey (1981) Studies in Avian Biology, 6, pp. 34-41; Caughley, G., Grice, D., Barker, R., Brown, B., The edge of the range (1988) Journal of Animal Ecology, 57, pp. 771-785; Cawthorne, R.A., Marchant, J.H., The effects of the 1978/79 winter on British bird populations (1980) Bird Study, 27, pp. 163-172; Droege, S., The North American Breeding Bird Survey (1990) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Biological Report, 90 (1), pp. 1-4. , J.
