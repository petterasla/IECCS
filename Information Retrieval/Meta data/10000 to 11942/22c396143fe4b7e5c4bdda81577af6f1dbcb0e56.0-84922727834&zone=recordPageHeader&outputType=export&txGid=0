We defend our assertion that vegetation change at the Erazo study site was predominantly driven by climate change due to concomitant changes recorded by multiple taxa in the fossil record.",,"alder; climate change; Ecuador; glacial period; interglacial; macrofossil; nonhuman; note; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; pollen; priority journal; vegetation; wood; Podocarpus",,,,,,"Punyasena, S.W., Dalling, J.W., Jaramillo, C., Turner, B.J., (2011) Science, 333, p. 1825. , www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/333/6051/1825-b; Cárdenas, M.L., (2011) Science, 331, p. 1055; Gosling, W.D., Mayle, F.E., Tate, N.J., Killeen, T.J., (2009) Rev.
