Although there is a growing consensus that global temperatures are on the rise systematically, some recent studies have pointed out that strong serial correlation (or a unit root) in global temperature data could, in theory, generate spurious evidence of a significant positive trend. In other words, strong serially correlated data can mimic trending behavior over fixed periods of time. A serial-correlation-robust trend test recently was proposed that controls for the possibility of spurious evidence due to strong serial correlation. This new test is valid whether the errors are stationary or have a unit root (strong serial correlation). This test also has the attractive feature that it does not require estimates of serial correlation nuisance parameters. The test is applied to six annual global temperature series, and it provides strong evidence that global temperature series have positive trends that are statistically significant even when controlling for the possibility of strong serial correlation. The point estimates of the rate of increase in the trend suggest that temperatures have risen about 0.5°C (1.0°F) 100 yr-1. If the analysis is restricted to twentieth-century data, many of the point estimates are closer to 0.6°C.",,"Global warming; Thermal effects; Global temperature; Climatology; correlation; global warming; trend analysis",,,,,,"Andrews, D.W.K., Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent covariance matrix estimation (1991) Econometrica, 59, pp. 817-858; Bloomfield, P., Trends in global temperatures (1992) Climatic Change, 21, pp. 275-287; Bloomfield, P., Nychka, D., Climate spectra and detecting climate change (1992) Climatic Change, 21, pp. 1-16; Gordon, A.H., Global warming as a manifestation of a random walk (1991) J.
