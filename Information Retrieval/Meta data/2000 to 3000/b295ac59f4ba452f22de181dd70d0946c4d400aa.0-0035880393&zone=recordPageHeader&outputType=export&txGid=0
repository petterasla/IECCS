The importance of biospheric CO 2 uptake or release to climate change has generated great interest in quantifying the dynamic responses of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling to climate change. However, less attention has been given to Africa, although it accounts for about one-fifth of the global net primary production and is one of the regions that have the greatest climate change. Here we use a biogeochemical model to simulate the dynamic variations in the carbon fluxes and stocks of African ecosystems caused by changes in climate and atmospheric CO 2 from 1901 and 1995. We estimate that climate change reduces plant production and soil carbon stocks and causes net CO 2 release, but the fertilization effect of increasing atmospheric CO 2 on photosynthesis reverses the reduction and leads to carbon accumulation in vegetation. Therefore, the combined effect of climate change and increasing atmospheric CO 2 causes net CO 2 uptake, particularly in central Africa. The mean rate of the carbon sequestration in the period 1981-1995 is calculated to be 0.34 Gt C yr -1. Nevertheless, Africa is not necessarily a significant carbon sink, because a large part of the carbon sequestration is offset by the carbon release arising from land use changes.","Africa Ecosystem modeling; Carbon cycle; Climate change","biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; dynamic response; ecosystem response; Africa",,,,,,"Amthor, J.S., Terrestrial higher-plant response to increasing atmospheric CO 2 in relation to the global carbon cycle (1995) Global Change Biol, 1, pp. 243-247; Bazzaz, F.A., (1996) Plants in Changing Environments, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bonan, G.B., Effects of land use on the climate of the United Sates (1998) Climate Change, 32, pp. 449-486; Cao, M.K., Woodward, F.I., Dynamic responses of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling to global climate change (1998) Nature, 393, pp. 249-252; Cao, M.K., Woodward, F.I., Net primary and ecosystem productions and carbon stocks of terrestrial ecosystems and their response to climate change (1998) Global Change Biol, 4, pp. 185-198; Ciais, P., Tans, P.P., Trolier, M., White, J.W.C., Francy, R.J., A large northern hemisphere terrestrial CO 2 sink indicated by 13C/ 12C of atmospheric CO 2 (1995) Science, 269, pp. 1098-1102; Cole, V., Cerri, C., Minami, K., Moiser, A., Rosenberg, N., Sauerbeck, D., Agricultural options for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (1996) Climate Change 1995: Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change, pp. 745-771. , Watson RT, Zinyowera MC, Moss RH (eds) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Collatz, G.J., Ribas-Casbo, M., Berry, C., Coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model for leaves of C4 plants (1992) Aust J Plant Physiol, 19, pp. 519-538; Conway, T.J., Tans, P., Waterman, L.S., Thoning, K.W., Masa, K.A., Gammon, R.H., Atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements in the remote global troposphere, 1981-1984 (1988) Tellus, 40 B, pp. 81-115; Dai, A., Fung, I.Y., Can climate variability contribute to the 'missing' CO 2 sink?
