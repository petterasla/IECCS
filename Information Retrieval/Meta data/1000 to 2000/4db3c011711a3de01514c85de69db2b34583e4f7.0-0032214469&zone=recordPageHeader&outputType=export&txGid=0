MEA processes are widely used for CO2 recovery from combustion flue gas in beverage use, etc. However, if we consider power plant scale CO2 recovery, the biggest theme is the reduction of energy needed to recover CO2. Our presentation focuses in sterically hindered amines and a new absorber packing. Also, the result of optimum steam system analysis are indicated. CO2 disposal method is needed with the combination of CO2 recovery, therefore CO2 subterranean disposal method is also discussed as the practical way.As a countermeasure for global warming, the development of CO2 recovery technology from fossil fuel power plant flue gas has continued.
