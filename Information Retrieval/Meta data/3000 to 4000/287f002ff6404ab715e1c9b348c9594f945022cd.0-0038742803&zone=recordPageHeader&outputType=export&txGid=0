These ecosystems are often important sites of biodiversity, biological productivity, and ecosystem services such as the removal of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants from inflowing rivers. Predicted effects of global climate change, including sea level rise, are likely to intensify saline intrusions into such ecosystems. Analyses of taxonomic diversity and abundance of zooplankton at different salinities in Lake Waihola, South Island, New Zealand, are supported by results of laboratory studies of salinity tolerances of 3 crustacean taxa Gladioferens pectinatus, Boeckella hamata and Daphnia carinata obtained from the lake. The field and laboratory analyses show that severe perturbations of zooplankton community structure and abundance are caused by even minor saline intrusions into Lake Waihola that raise the salinity to > 1.2 psu. Our analyses of Lake Waihola, and data from brackish ecosystems around the world, show that even relatively small increases in salinity levels can drive such systems to a state of depleted biodiversity and abundance, altering ecosystem functioning.","Climate change; Community structure; Lake Waihola; Saline intrusion; Salinity; Shallow lake; Zooplankton abundance; Zooplankton diversity","abundance; biodiversity; climate change; coastal wetland; community structure; salinity; zooplankton; New Zealand; Crustacea; Daphnia; Daphnia carinata; Pectinatus",,,,,,"Aaser, H.F., Jeppesen, E., Søndergaard, M., Seasonal dynamics of the mysid Neomysis integer and its predation on the copepod Eurytemora affinis in a shallow hypertrophic brackish lake (1995) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 127, pp. 47-56; Attayde, J.L., Bozelli, R.L., Assessing the indicator properties of zooplankton assemblages to disturbance gradients by canonical correspondence analysis (1998) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 55, pp. 1789-1797; Bayly, I.A.E., Ecological studies on the planktonic copepoda of the Brisbane River estuary with special reference to Gladioferens pectinatus Brady (Calanoida) (1965) Aust J Mar Freshw Res, 16, pp. 315-350; Beaman, R., Larcombe, P., Carter, R.M., New evidence for the Holocene sea-level high from the inner shelf, central Great Barrier Reef, Australia (1994) J Sediment Res A, 64, pp. 881-885; Burns, C.W., Schallenberg, M., Calanoid copepods versus cladocerans: Consumer effects on protozoa in lakes of different trophic status (2001) Limnol Oceanogr, 46, pp. 1558-1565; Chapman, M.A., Lewis, M.H., (1976) An Introduction to the Freshwater Crustacea of New Zealand, , William Collins New Zealand, Auckland; De Jonge, V.N., Classification of brackish coastal inland waters (1974) Hydrobiol Bull, 8, pp. 29-39; Egborge, A.B.M., Salinity and the distribution of rotifers in the Lagos Harbour - Badagry Creek system, Nigeria (1994) Hydrobiologia, 272, pp. 95-104; Ferreira, J.G., (2000) Oceanus 2000, V2.0, , www.tejo.dcea.fct.uni.pt/oceanus2000, Institute of Marine Research, Universidade Nova De Lisboa, Lisbon; Frey, D.G., The penetration of cladocerans into saline waters (1993) Hydrobiologia, 267, pp. 233-248; Garcia, C.M., Garcia-Ruiz, R., Rendon, M., Niell, F.X., Lucerna, J., Hydrological cycle and interannual variability of the aquatic community in a temporary saline lake (Fuente de Piedra, southern Spain) (1997) Hydrobiologia, 345, pp. 131-141; Green, J., Zooplankton associations in East African lakes spanning a wide salinity range (1993) Hydrobiologia, 267, pp. 249-256; Green, J., Menengestou, S., Specific diversity and community structure of Rotifera in a salinity series of Ethiopian inland waters (1993) Hydrobiologia, 209, pp. 95-106; Grindley, J.R., Estuarine plankton (1981) Estuarine Ecology with Particular Reference to Southern Africa, , Day JH (ed).
