Quantification of all building phases is important in life-cycle assessments (LCAs), especially for the construction phase, which is often disregarded. This research uses an input-output-based LCA framework to create a more comprehensive estimate of the environmental effects of construction processes. The hybrid LCA model is based on Carnegie Mellon University's Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) tool and combines a new EIO-LCA ""hybrid"" interface with updated and reformulated environmental effect vectors for EIO-LCA's 13 construction sectors. Eight construction project case studies modeled on the input-output (I-O)-based hybrid LCA framework demonstrate the model's broad applicability; gasoline, particulate matter, and global warming potential effects generally increased across all construction sectors and case studies. The I-O-based hybrid LCA model for construction is intended to help decision makers make more informed decisions regarding the construction industry, adding environmental quality and sustainable development as project goals instead of unintentional benefits of economic decisions. © 2008 ASCE.","Climatic data; Construction industry; Construction management; Construction sites; Emissions; Energy consumption; Environmental issues; Life cycles","Construction; Construction industry; Global warming; Liquid fuels; Petroleum products; Phase interfaces; Planning; Project management; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Climatic data; Construction management; Construction sites; Emissions; Energy consumption; Environmental issues; Life cycles; Life cycle; construction industry; environmental effect; environmental issue; estimation method; input-output analysis; life cycle analysis",,,,,,"Adalberth, K., ""Energy demand during the life cycle of a building"" (1996) Proc., CIB W67: Energy and Mass Flow in the Life Cycle of Buildings, pp. 343-348. , E.
