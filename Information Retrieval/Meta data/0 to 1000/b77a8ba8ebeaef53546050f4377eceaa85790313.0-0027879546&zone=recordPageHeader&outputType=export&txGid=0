Most of these studies have been carried out in boreal sub-Arctic regions using different techniques and means of assessing representativeness of the tundra. Here are reported a time series of CH4 flux measurements from a true Arctic tundra site. A total of 528 independent observations were made at 22 fixed sites during the summers of 1991 and 1992. The data are fully comparable to the most extensive dataset yet produced on methane emissions from sub-Arctic tundra-like environments. Based on the data presented, from a thaw-season with approximately 55% of normal precipitation, a global tundra CH4 source of 18-30 Tg CH4 yr-1 is estimated. This is within the range of 42±26 Tg CH4 yr-1 found in a similar sub-Arctic tundra environment. No single-parameter relationship between one environmental factor and CH4 flux covering all sites was found. This is also in line with conclusions drawn in the sub-Arctic. However, inter-season variations in CH4 flux at dry sites were largely controlled by the position of the water table, while flux from wetter sites seemed mainly to be controlled by soil temperature. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Arctic tundra; climatic change; methane budget; methane emission","arctic tundra; climate change; methane budget; methane emission; tundra; Arctic",,,,,,"Aselman, I., Crutzen, P.J., Global distributions of natural freshwater wetlands and rice paddies, their net primary productivity, seasonality and possible methane emissions (1989) J.
