The analyses were conducted for 28 meteorological stations, during the period from 1930 to 2006, characterized by a long-term and high-quality dataset. The software used to process the data was the RClimdex 1.0. The analyses of extreme temperature indices have identified an increase in air temperature in Utah during the last century. Meanwhile, the analyses of precipitation indices showed a large variation throughout the studied area and time period, and, in general, with few statistically significant trends. Thus, it was not possible to conclude that significant changes in precipitation have occurred in this region over the last century. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climatology; Environmental impact; Global warming; Quality control; RClimdex","Air temperature; Daily temperatures; Data sets; Extreme temperature indices; High quality; Meteorological station; RClimdex; Time-periods; Utah , USA; Climate change; Climatology; Global warming; Quality control; Environmental impact; air temperature; climate change; data set; environmental impact; extreme event; geostatistics; global warming; precipitation (climatology); quality control; software; United States; Utah",,,,,,"Alexander, L.V., Zhang, X., Peterson, T.C., Caesar, J., Gleason, B., Klein Tank, A.M.G., Haylock, M., Vazquez-Aguirre, J.L., Global observed changes in daily climate extremes of temperature and precipitation (2006) Journal of Geophysical Research, 111, pp. D05109; Alexander, L.V., Hope, P., Collins, D., Trewin, B., Lynch, A., Nicholls, N., Trends in Australia's climate means and extremes: a global context (2007) Australian Meteorological Magazine, 56, pp. 1-18; Brunetti, M., Buffoni, L., Mangianti, F., Maugeri, M., Nanni, T., Temperature, precipitation and extreme events during the last century in Italy (2004) Global and Planetary Change, 40, pp. 141-149; Brunetti, M., Maugeri, M., Monti, F., Nanni, T., Temperature and precipitation variability in Italy in the last two centuries from homogenized instrumental time series (2006) International Journal of Climatology, 26, pp. 345-381; Choi, G., Collins, D., Ren, G., Trewin, B., Baldi, M., Fukuda, Y., Afzaal, M., Zhouc, Y., Changes in means and extreme events of temperature and precipitation in the Asia-Pacific Network region, 1955-2007 (2009) International Journal of Climatology, 29, pp. 1906-1925; Dufek, A.S., Ambrizzi, T., Precipitation variability in São Paulo State, Brazil (2008) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 93, pp. 167-178; Easterling, D.R., Evans, J.L., Groisman, P.Y., Karl, T.R., Kunkel, K.E., Ambenje, P., Observed variability and trends in extreme climate events (2000) Bulletin of American Meteorological Society, 81, pp. 417-425; Folland, C.K., Karl, T.R., Christy, J.R., Clarke, R.A., Gruza, G.V., Jouzel, J., Mann, M.E., Wang, S.W., Observed climate variability and change (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
