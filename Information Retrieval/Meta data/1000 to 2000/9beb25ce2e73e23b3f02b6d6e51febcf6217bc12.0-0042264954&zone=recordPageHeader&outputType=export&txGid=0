Special emphasis is given to the response of the west-east SST contrast along the equator. The transient response of tropical sea surface temperature to a global warming is shown to have two distinctive stages: a fast surface adjustment stage of years and a slow thermocline adjustment stage of decades. Under a global warming heat flux that does not vary much in space, the initial response is always an enhanced west-east SST contrast. The final equilibrium response, however, depends on the effective latitudinal differential heating. The west-east SST contrast increases for an enhanced latitudinal differential heating, and vise versa.",,"global warming; ocean response; sea surface temperature; tropical climatology",,,,,,"Bretherton, F., Ocean climate modeling (1982) Progress in Oceanography, 46, pp. 2621-2624. , Pergamon; Cane, M.A., Clement, A.C., Kaplan, A., Kushnir, Y., Pozdnyakov, D., Seager, R., Zebiak, S., Twentieth century sea surface temperature trends (1997) Science, 275, pp. 957-960; Clement, A.C., Seager, R., Cane, M.A., Zebiak, S.E., An ocean dynamic thermostat (1996) J.
