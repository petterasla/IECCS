Annual and monthly reported dengue cases were compared with precipitation and temperature data. Results show that the incidence of dengue in Puerto Rico was relatively constant over time despite global warming, possibly due to the offsetting effects of declining rainfall, improving health care and little change in population. Seasonal fluctuations of dengue were driven by rainfall increases from May to November. Year-to-year variability in dengue cases was positively related to temperature, but only weakly associated with local rainfall and an index of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Climatic conditions were mapped with respect to dengue cases and patterns in high and low years were compared. During epidemics, a low pressure system east of Florida draws warm humid air over the northwestern Caribbean. Long-term trends in past observed and future projected rainfall and temperatures were studied. Rainfall has declined slowly, but temperatures in the Caribbean are rising with the influence of global warming. Thus, dengue may increase in the future, and it will be necessary to anticipate dengue epidemics using climate forecasts, to reduce adverse health impacts. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Caribbean; Climate influence; Dengue; Epidemics","rain; annual variation; climate conditions; climate effect; climate variation; comparative study; dengue fever; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; epidemic; precipitation (climatology); precipitation intensity; air; article; Central America; climate change; dengue; El Nino; environmental change; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; health care; incidence; population and population related phenomena; precipitation; Puerto Rico; seasonal variation; United States; Animals; Climate; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Insect Vectors; Puerto Rico; Rain; Seasons; Time Factors; Weather; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Florida [United States]; Greater Antilles; North America; Puerto Rico; United States; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Amarakoon AMD, Chen AA, Rawlins SC, Taylor MA. 2007.
