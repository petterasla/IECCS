However, most quantitative measures of these three concepts are sensitive to the scale at which they are made. In particular, definitions of rarity based on an area-of-occupancy threshold can nearly always be met if area of occupancy is calculated from a sufficiently fine-scale (high-resolution) grid. Recommendations for dealing with scale dependency include (1) choosing a standard scale of measurement, (2) using multiple scales of measurement, and (3) developing indices that combine information from multiple scales. As an example of the second and third approach, the construction of a species' scale-area curve represents a unifying method for quantifying all three indicators of extinction risk-rarity, rate of decline, and population fragmentation - as functions of area of occupancy and measurement scale. A multiscale analysis is also of practical importance because measurements made at different scales are relevant to different extinction processes. Coarse-scale measures of rarity are most appropriate when threat is assessed on the basis of spatially autocorrelated events of a large extent, such as global climate change, whereas fine-scale measures may best predict extinction risk due to local processes such as demographic stochasticity. We illustrate our arguments with a case study of the British distributions of two related plant species that show a 200-fold reversal in their relative rarity when measured at different scales.",,"conservation status; endangered species; extinction risk; habitat fragmentation; population decline; rarity; scale effect",,,,,,"Begon, M., Harper, J.L., Townsend, C.R., (1990) Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities. 2nd Edition, , Blackwell Scientific Publications, Boston; Burgman, M.A., Possingham, H.P., Lynch, A.J.J., Keith, D.A., McCarthy, M.A., Hopper, S.D., Drury, W.L., Devries, R.J., A method for setting the size of plant conservation target areas (2001) Conservation Biology, 15, pp. 603-616; Caughley, G., Directions in conservation biology (1994) Journal of Animal Ecology, 63, pp. 215-244; Costanza, R., Maxwell, T., Resolution and predictability: An approach to the scaling problem (1994) Landscape Ecology, 9, pp. 47-57; Cowley, M.J.R., Thomas, C.D., Thomas, J.A., Warren, M.S., Flight areas of British butterflies: Assessing species status and decline (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society London Series B, 266, pp. 1587-1592; Dale, M.R.T., (1999) Spatial Pattern Analysis in Plant Ecology, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Diamond, J.M., Island biogeography and conservation: Strategy and limitations (1976) Science, 193, pp. 1027-1029; Erickson, R.O., The Clematis Fremontii var.
