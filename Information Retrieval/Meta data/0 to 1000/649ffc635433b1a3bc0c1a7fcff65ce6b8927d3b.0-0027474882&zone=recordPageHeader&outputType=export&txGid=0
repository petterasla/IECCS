Production of high quality feed requires intensive agronomic practices that result in increased emission of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, which also contribute to global climate change. Focusing on India, we estimate that improved diets could reduce by one-third greenhouse gas production (expressed as CO2 equivalents) per kg of milk. On the other hand, replacement of bullocks with tractors is projected to result in a greater than two-fold increase in CO2 equivalents. © 1993.",,"carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; agriculture; air pollution; bovids; cattle; conference paper; developing country; diet; food quality; gas waste; greenhouse effect; india; milk production; nonhuman; Animalia; Bos taurus; Bovidae",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Craumer, Farm productivity and energy efficiency on Amish and modern dairying (1978) Agric.
