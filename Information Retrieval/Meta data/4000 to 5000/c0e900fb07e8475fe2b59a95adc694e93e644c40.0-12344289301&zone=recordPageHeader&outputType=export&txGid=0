In addition, the resulting wastes cause various environmental problems ranging from widespread ecosystem disruptions to global warming, The most common response to these problems has been to promote technological improvements in eco-efficiency, which Welford defined as ""adding maximum value with minimum resource use and minimum pollution."" Although constructive, improvements in eco-efficiency alone will not guarantee sustainability of industrialized societies because the limited supplies of nonrenewable minerals cannot be extended indefinitely by recycling and substitution, and a transition to renewable and nuclear energy sources would result in significant negative environmental impacts, particularly if deployed on a large scale. In addition, according to the second law of thermodynamics, industrial production technologies have inherently unavoidable environmental impacts. Finally, any hardwon improvements in eco-efficiency will soon be negated if growth in population and consumption is allowed to continue. Consequently, long-term industrial sustainability can be achieved only through a transition to a steady-state economy where the total throughput of matter-energy is kept at a constant and sustainable level. This requires not only improvements in eco-efficiency but also a reassessment of fundamental societal values that erroneously equate material consumption and economic growth with well-being and happiness. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.","Economic growth; Entropy; Pollution prevention; Recycling; Renewable energy; Societal factors","Economic growth; Pollution prevention; Renewable energy; Societal factors; Economic and social effects; Entropy; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Nuclear energy; Pollution; Problem solving; Recycling; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Thermodynamics; Ecology",,,,,,"(1998) Eco-efficiency; (1996) Sustainable America: a New Consensus for the Prosperity, Opportunity and a Healthy Environment for the Future, , www.whitehouse.gov/PCSD/Publications/; Welford, R., (1997) Hijacking Environmentalism: Corporate Responses to Sustainable Development, , London, UK: Earthscan Publications Ltd; (1987) Our Common Future, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Reid, D., (1995) Sustainable Development: an Introductory Guide, , London, UK: Earthscan Publications Ltd; Constanza, R., Patten, B.C., Defining and predicting sustainability (1995) Ecological Economics, 15, pp. 193-196; Daly, H.E., (1980) Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Assays toward a Steady-state Economy, , New York, NY: W.H.
