Box 1140, 84479 Burghausen, Germany","For NF3 remote microwave plasma chamber cleaning, compared with CF4 cleaning processes, a reduction of emission of gases relevant to global warming is observed. At the same time a reduction of operating costs for the abatement is possible. The presented data show a very high destruction and removal efficiency for NF3 and its major decomposition product F2 in an ESCAPE abatement system. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Abatement; F2; NF3; Operating costs; Remote microwave plasma","Chemical cleaning; Decomposition; Environmental protection; Global warming; Plasma applications; Process engineering; Production engineering; Remote microwave plasmas; Silicon wafers",,,,,,"Lester, M.A., (2000) Semicond.
