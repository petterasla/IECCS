We measured the flux of these three gases over 2 years along catenas at two forested sites, to determine the important controls. Well-drained soils consumed atmospheric CH<inf>4</inf>, while poorly drained swamp soils embedded in depressions were a source. CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes could be predicted primarily by temperature and moisture, and tree cover exerted an influence mainly through the creation of large soil porosity, leading to increased consumption rates. In contrast, there were very poor relationships between N<inf>2</inf>O fluxes and environmental variables, reflecting the complex interactions of microbial, edaphic, and N cycling processes, such as nitrification in well-drained soils and denitrification in poorly drained soils, which led to N<inf>2</inf>O production (or consumption) in soils and hence larger variability. At the broad temporal and spatial scale, soil C:N ratio was a good predictor of N<inf>2</inf>O emission rates, through its influence upon N cycling processes. Soil CO<inf>2</inf> emission rates showed less spatial and temporal variability, and were controlled by temperature and moisture. The source strength, in global warming potential of CH<inf>4</inf> and N <inf>2</inf>O fluxes in CO<inf>2</inf> equivalents, was reduced markedly when trace gas fluxes from 5 to 15% poorly drained soils were included in the net global warming potential calculation of whole forested watersheds. Soils drainage class integrates many of the biogeochemical processes controlling the flux of these gases providing a framework for extrapolating results.
