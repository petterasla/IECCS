The present benthic marine fauna of the Southern Ocean is rich and diverse, consisting of a mixture of taxa with differing evolutionary histories and biogeographical affinities. Certain features suggest the operation of vicariant processes, and climate cycles affecting distributional ranges and ice-sheet extension may both have enhanced speciation processes. The overall cooling of southern high-latitude seas since the mid-Eocene has been neither smooth nor steady. Intermittent periods of global warming and the influence of Milankovitch cyclicity is likely to have led to regular pulses of migration in and out of Antarctica. The resultant diversity pump may explain in part the high species richness of some marine taxa in the Southern Ocean. It is difficult to suggest how the existing fauna will react to present global warming. The paper is followed by a discussion. -from Authors",,"benthos; climatic change; fossil; global warming; Antarctica; Southern Ocean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027011487
