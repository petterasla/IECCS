However, applying climate model projections to local impact models can be difficult as outcomes can vary considerably between different climate models, and including results from many models is demanding. This study combines multiple climate model outputs with hydrological impact modelling through the use of response surfaces. Response surfaces represent the sensitivity of the impact model to incremental changes in climate variables and show probabilies for reaching a priori determined thresholds. Response surfaces were calculated using the HBV hydrological model for three basins in Sweden. An ensemble of future climate projections was then superimposed onto each response surface, producing a probability estimate for exceeding the threshold being evaluated. Site specific impacts thresholds were used where applicable. Probabilistic trends for future change in hazards or potential can be shown and evaluated. It is particularly useful for visualising the range of probable outcomes from climate models and can easily be updated with new results as they are made available. © 2012 Author(s).",,"climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; ensemble forecasting; global climate; hydrological change; hydrological modeling; Scandinavia; Hepatitis B virus",,,,,,"Andreasson, J., Bergstrom, S., Carlsson, B., Graham, L.P., Lindstrom, G., Hydrological change - Climate change impact simulations for Sweden (2004) Ambio, 33 (4-5), pp. 228-234; Arheimer, B., Brandt, M., Modelling nitrogen transport and retention in the catchments of southern Sweden (1998) Ambio, 27 (6), pp. 471-480; Arheimer, B., Andreasson, J., Fogelberg, S., Johnsson, H., Pers, C.B., Persson, K., Climate change impact on water quality: Model results from southern Sweden (2005) Ambio, 34 (7), pp. 559-566; Bergstrom, S., Carlsson, B., Gardelin, M., Lindstrom, G., Petterson, A., Rummukainen, M., Climate change impacts on runoff in Sweden - Assessments by global climate models, dynamical downscalling and hydrological modelling (2001) Climate Research, 16 (2), pp. 101-112; Beven, K., I believe in climate change but how precautionary do we need to be in planning for the future?
