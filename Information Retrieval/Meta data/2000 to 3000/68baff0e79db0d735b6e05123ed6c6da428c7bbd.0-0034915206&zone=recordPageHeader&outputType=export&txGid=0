However, new techniques and better platforms for the measurement of global warming and regional databases are still old-fashioned and are not being developed sufficiently. With respect to this agenda, since 1993, at the request of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), to monitor functions of global warming, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has set up a Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Station on the western coast of Korea (Anmyun-do) and has been actively monitoring global warming over Northeast Asia. In addition, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been measured for a similar KMA global warming program at Kosan, Cheju Island since 1990. Aerosol and radiation have also been measured at both sites as well as in Seoul. The observations have been analyzed using diagnostics of climate change in Northeast Asia and also have been internationally compared. Results indicate that greenhouse gases are in good statistic agreement with the NOAA/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) long-term trends of monthly mean concentrations and seasonal cycles. Atmospheric particulate matter has also been analyzed for particular Asian types in terms of optical depth, number concentration and size distribution.","Climate monitoring and diagnostics; Global warming; Surface measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide and aerosol","Aerosols; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Database systems; Meteorology; Surface measurement; Climate monitoring; Global warming; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; global warming; greenhouse gas; monitoring; particulate matter; aerosol; article; atmosphere; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; Korea; measurement; particle size; particulate matter; radiation; seashore; seasonal variation; statistical analysis; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Databases, Factual; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Industry; Korea; Particle Size; Seasons; Korea",,"Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Charlson, R.J., Schwartz, S.E., Hales, J.M., Cess, R.D., Coakley J.A., Jr., Hausen, J.E., Hoffmann, D.J., 'Climate forcing by anthropogenic aerosol' (1992) Science, 25, pp. 423-430; Charlson, R.J., Heinzenberg, J., (1994) Aerosol Forcing of Climate, p. 416. , John Wiley & Sons; Coakley, J.A., Cess, R.C., Yurevich, F.B., 'The effect of tropospheric aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget: A parameterization for climate models' (1983) J.
