The sequence of subsequent phenological events (phytoplankton spring bloom, grazer peak, clearwater phase) results in part from coupled phytoplankton-grazer interactions. Disentangling the separate, direct effects of correlated climatic drivers (stratification-dependent underwater light climate vs. water temperature) from their indirect effects mediated through trophic feedbacks is impossible using observational field data, which challenges our understanding of global warming effects on seasonal plankton dynamics. We therefore manipulated water temperature and stratification depth independently in experimental field mesocosms containing ambient microplankton and inocula of the resident grazer Daphnia hyalina. Higher light availability in shallower surface layers accelerated primary production, warming accelerated consumption and growth of Daphnia, and both factors speeded up successional dynamics driven by trophic feedbacks. Specifically, phytoplankton peaked and decreased earlier and Daphnia populations increased and peaked earlier at both shallower stratification and higher temperature. The timing of ciliate dynamics was unrelated to both factors. Volumetric peak densities of phytoplankton, ciliates and Daphnia in the surface layer were also unaffected by temperature but declined with stratification depth in parallel with light availability. The latter relationship vanished, however, when population sizes were integrated over the entire water column. Overall our results suggest that, integrated over the entire water column of a deep lake, surface warming and shallower stratification independently speed up spring successional events, whereas the magnitudes of phytoplankton and zooplankton spring peaks are less sensitive to these factors. Therefore, accelerated dynamics under warming need not lead to a trophic mismatch (given similar grazer inocula at the time of stratification). We emphasize that entire water column dynamics must be studied to estimate global warming effects on lake ecosystems. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Ciliates; Clearwater phase; Daphnia hyalina; Enclosure experiment; Mesocosms; Phytoplankton spring bloom","climate effect; ecosystem response; global warming; growth response; lake water; mesocosm; phenology; phytoplankton; population dynamics; stratification; succession; temperate environment; water column; water temperature; Ciliophora; Daphnia; Daphnia hyalina",,,,,,"Aberle, N., Lengfellner, K., Sommer, U., Spring bloom succession, grazing impact and herbivore selectivity of ciliate communities in response to winter warming (2007) Oecologia, 150, pp. 668-681; Adrian, R., Wilhelm, S., Gerten, D., Life-history traits of lake plankton species may govern their phenological response to climate warming (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 652-661; Austin, J., Colman, S., A century of temperature variability in Lake Superior (2008) Limnology and Oceanography, 53, pp. 2724-2730; Berger, S.A., Diehl, S., Kunz, T.J., Albrecht, D., Oucible, A.M., Ritzer, S., Light supply, plankton biomass, and seston stoichiometry in a gradient of lake mixing depths (2006) Limnology and Oceanography, 51, pp. 1898-1905; Berger, S.A., Diehl, S., Stibor, H., et al, Water temperature and mixing depth affect timing and magnitude of events during spring succession of the plankton (2007) Oecologia, 150, pp. 643-654; Bleiker, W., Schanz, F., Light climate as the key factor controlling the spring dynamics of phytoplankton in Lake Zurich (1997) Aquatic Sciences, 59, pp. 135-157; Bottrell, H.H., Duncan, A., Gliwicz, Z.M., et al, Review of some problems in zooplankton production studies (1976) Norwegian Journal of Zoology, 24, pp. 419-456; Càceres, C.E., Interspecific variation in the abundance, production, and emergence of Daphnia diapausing eggs (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1699-1710; de Senerpont Domis, L.N., Mooij, W.M., Huelsmann, S., van Nes, E.H., Scheffer, M., Can overwintering versus diapausing strategy in Daphnia determine match-mismatch events in zooplankton-algae interactions?
