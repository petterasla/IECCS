OAT can determine the sound-speed profile from measured acoustic travel times over known ray paths. The seawater temperature profile and the existence of ocean currents can be estimated using the sound-speed profile. However, the measured arrival time structure contains many pulses with different paths. Ray geometry fundamentals (i.e., numbers of turning points of rays, initial angle, etc.) must be properly identified. The sound-speed structure varies with observation area (i.e., west Mediterranean Sea. low-, mid-latitude sea area, etc.) and season. It has been shown by the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC) that a special ocean structure with sound speed increasing linearly with depth is formed in the west Mediterranean Sea. We have to understand the characteristics of sound propagation for each sea area in advance. In this paper, the characteristics of sound propagation for an ocean model for areas such as the west Mediterranean Sea have been analyzed in the time domain using Stickler's normal mode method (SNM). The effects of acoustic bandwidth (ABW) on the pattern of arrivals have been examined.","Acoustic bandwidth; Ocean acoustic tomography; Stickler's normal mode method; West Mediterranean sea","Acoustic wave velocity measurement; Bandwidth; Global warming; Ocean currents; Seawater; Temperature distribution; Acoustic bandwidth; Ocean acoustic tomography; Stickler's normal mode method; West Mediterranean sea; Acoustic wave transmission",,,,,,"Fujimori, H., Nakano, I., (1995) Meeting of the Marine Acoustics Society of Japan, p. 101. , Tokyo [in Japanese]; Brekhovskikh, L.M., Lysanov, Yu., (1982) Fundamentals of Ocean Acoustics, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Chap. 6; Officer, C.B., (1958) Introduction to the Theory of Sound Transmission, , McGraw-Hill, New York, Chap. 3; Stickler, D.C., (1975) J.
