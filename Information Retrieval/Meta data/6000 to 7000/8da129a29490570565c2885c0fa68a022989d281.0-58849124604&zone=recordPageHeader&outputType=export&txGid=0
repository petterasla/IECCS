This has mostly been attributed to direct impacts of human activities such as overfishing or habitat loss and degradation, whilst the potential influence of changes in oceanic conditions has received less attention. Eel are characterized by a complex and still enigmatic life cycle that includes a trans-oceanic spawning and larval migration. The apparent synchrony in the decline of eel populations worldwide suggests that the oceanic mechanisms involved are similar for all populations. We analyse the relationships between oceanic conditions in eel spawning areas and glass eel recruitment success of the 3 most commercially important species of the genus Anguilla: A. anguilla, A. rostrata, and A. japonica. We provide evidence that the survival of eel larvae is strongly correlated with food availability during their early life stages. Over the last 4 decades, changes in the marine production related to global warming may have led to the decline of European, American and Japanese eel populations. In the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the shifts in the temperature regime detected in the late 1970s were followed by shifts in the recruitment regime of glass eel for the 3 species. The decrease in primary production through climate-driven processes has therefore affected the recruitment of eel populations. © Inter-Research 2008.","Anguilla; Bottom-up; Climate; Primary production; Regime shift","fish; food availability; global warming; habitat loss; human activity; larva; life cycle; survival; Anguilla anguilla; Anguilla japonica; Anguilla rostrata",,,,,,"Aita, M.N., Yamanaka, Y., Kishi, M.J., Interdecadal variation of the lower trophic ecosystem in the northern Pacific between 1948 and 2002, in a 3-D implementation of the NEMURO model (2007) Ecol Modell, 202, pp. 81-94; Anderson, C.N.K., Hsieh, C.H., Sandin, S.A., Hewitt, R., and others, Why fishing magnifies fluctuations in fish abundance (2008) Nature, 452, pp. 835-840; Worldwide decline of eel resources necessitates immediate action - Québec declaration of concern (2003) Fisheries, 28, pp. 28-30. , Anonymous; Antunes, C., Tesch, F.W., A critical consideration of the metamorphosis zone when identifying daily rings in otoliths of European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L) (1997) Mar Biol, 6, pp. 102-107; Arai, T., Otake, T., Tsukamoto, K., Timing of metamorphosis and larval segregation of the Atlantic eels Anguilla rostrata and A. anguilla, as revealed by otolith microstructure and microchemistry (2000) Mar Biol, 137, pp. 39-45; Bardonnet, A., Riera, P., Feeding of glass eels (Anguilla anguilla) in the course of their estuarine migration: New insights from stable isotope analysis (2005) Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 63, pp. 201-209; Bates, N.R., Interannual variability of oceanic CO2 and biogeochemical properties in the western North Atlantic subtropical gyre (2001) Deep-Sea Res II, 48, pp. 1507-1528; Beaugrand, G., Reid, P.C., Ibanez, F., Lindley, J.A., Edwards, M., Reorganization of North Atlantic marine copepod biodiversity and climate (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1692-1694; Beaugrand G, Brander K, Lindley J, Souissi S, Reid P (2003) Plankton effect on cod recruitment in the North Sea.
