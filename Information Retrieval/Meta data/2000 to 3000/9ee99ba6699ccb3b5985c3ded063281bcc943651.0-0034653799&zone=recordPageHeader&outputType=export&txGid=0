Values obtained were density, extension rate, and calcification rate. Tissue thickness, the depth to which skeletons were occupied by tissue at the time of collection, was also measured. Extension rate, calcification rate, and tissue thickness were significantly greater at the top of colonies than at the sides. Extension rate and calcification rate decreased from north to south along the GBR (latitudinal range of ~9°) and were significantly and directly related to annual average sea surface temperature (SST; range ~25- 27°C). For each 1°C rise in SST, average annual calcification increased by 0.39 g cm-2 year-1 and average annual extension increased by 3.1 mm year-1 (c.f. average values of 1.63 g cm-2 year-1 and 12.9 mm year-1, respectively). Density was inversely correlated with extension rate and increased with distance offshore. Data for massive Porites colonies from the GBR were extended though 20°of latitude and an average annual SST range of 23-29°C using published data for the Hawaiian Archipelago (Grigg, R.W., 1981. Coral reef development at high latitudes in Hawaii. Proc. 4th Int. Coral Reef Symp., Manila, Vol. 1, pp. 687-693; Grigg, R.W., 1997. Paleoceanography of coral reefs in the Hawaiian-Emperor Chain - revisited. Coral Reefs 16, S33-S38) and Phuket, Thailand (Scoffin. T.P., Tudhope. A.W., Brown. B.E., Chansang. H., Cheeney. R.F., 1992. Patterns and possible environmental controls of skeletogenesis of Porites lutea, South Thailand. Coral Reefs 11, 1-11). The response of calcification rate to temperature remained linear. Variation in annual average SST accounted for 84% of the variance. For each 1°C rise in SST, average annual calcification increased by 0.33 g cm-2 year-1 and average annual extension increased by 3.1 mm year-1 (c.f. average values of 1.50 g cm-2 year-1 and 11.6 mm year-1, respectively). The sensitivity of calcification rate in Porites to SST, combined with observed 20th Century increases in SSTs, suggests that calcification rates may have already significantly increased along the GBR in response to global climate change.
