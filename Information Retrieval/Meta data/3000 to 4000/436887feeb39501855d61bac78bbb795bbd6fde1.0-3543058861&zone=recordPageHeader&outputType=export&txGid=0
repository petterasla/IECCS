Location: Nan Ao Island is on the Tropic of Cancer 117° E in the South China Sea, eastern Guangdong Province, China. There are archipelagos of islets extending south-east, and several coastal islets around Nan Ao. Methods: Five field surveys were made in 1999-2001. Voucher specimens were tagged, catalogued, and deposited in major museum collections. The comparable Floridian disjunct pattern was researched and described in overview. Results: Five species - a toad, two lizards and two snakes - collected on Nan Ao and three satellite islands were added to the two previously documented species - a lizard and a snake - that fit the austro-boreal disjunct pattern. One lizard and one snake are minor range extensions of a hundred or few km. One snake's Nan Ao population is disjunct by about 450 km and one lizard's by about 550 km. The small, semi-fossorial, short-legged toad is the most notable, separated from the main area of its range by about 800 km. This is similar to the greatest distance between north Floridian and Keys disjunct populations. Main conclusions: (1) Seven Nan Ao species of terrestrial vertebrates are isolated and disjunct from conspecifics found to the north, upland and inland; this compares to five species showing a similar north Florida to Florida Keys pattern. (2) The Nan Ao species have no conspecifics known from the intervening area whereas four of the five Floridian species have conspecific, but dissimilar, populations in the gap. (3) Nan Ao and its satellite islets were high points on a large coastal plain at glacial maximum. (4) Holocene sea level rise and concomitant global warming may have isolated the Nan Ao relicts that had continuous distributions at glacial maximum. (5) The intervening mainland conspecific populations may have been replaced by tropical species that moved north along the mainland but failed to colonize the islands. (6) If so, significant adaptation to a warmer climate must have occurred to enable survival of the Nan Ao relicts to the present.","Dinodon; Elaphe; Eumeces; Gekko; Gloydius; Grayian distribution; Megophrys; Relicts","biogeography; geographical distribution; range expansion; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong; Nan Ao Island; Amphibia; Animalia; Anura; Dinodon; Elaphe; Eumeces; Gekko; Gloydius; Megophrys; Reptilia; Serpentes; Squamata; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Boufford, D.E., Spongberg, S.A., Eastern Asian-Eastern North American phytogeographical relationships - A history from the time of Linnaeus to the twentieth century (1983) Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 70, pp. 423-439; Chau, L., Lau, M., Announcement of the new China programme (2003) Living Forests, 6, p. 3. , Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, Hong Kong; Christman, S.P., Patterns of geographic variation in Florida snakes (1980) Bulletin of the Florida State Museum, Biological Sciences, 25, pp. 157-256; Duellman, W.E., Schwartz, A., Amphibians and reptiles of southern Florida (1958) Bulletin of the Florida State Museum, Biological Sciences, 3, pp. 181-324; Gloyd, H.K., Conant, R., Snakes of the Agkistrodon complex (1990) Contributions to Herpetology 6, , Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, Ithaca, NY; Han, Y.-L., Xiao, X., Lazell, J., Lu, W., Studies of the phenotypic character and consanguinity of isozymes in species and population (sic) (2002) Hereditas, Beijing, 24, pp. 670-674; Karsen, S., Lau, M., Bogadek, A., (1998) Hong Kong Amphibians and Reptiles, , Provisional Urban Council, Hong Kong; Lazell, J., (1989) Wildlife of the Florida Keys: A Natural History, , Island Press, Washington, DC; Lazell, J., The origins of the herpetofauna of the islands on the continental shelf of South China (1999) Tropical Island Herpetofauna, pp. 79-96. , ed. by H.
