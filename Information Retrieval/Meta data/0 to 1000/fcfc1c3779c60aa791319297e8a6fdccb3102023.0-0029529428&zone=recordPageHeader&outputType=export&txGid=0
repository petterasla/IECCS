A particular concentrations target can be achieved in a variety of ways. It turns out that the choice of emissions time-path is as important as the concentrations level itself in determining the ultimate price-tag. Rather than choosing arbitrary emission trajectories, more attention needs to be devoted to identifying those paths that minimize the costs of achieving a specific target. © 1995.","Energy modeling; Global warming; Optimization","atmospheric carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide emission; carbon emission; economic evaluation; economics; emission time-path; environmental economics; global warming; modelling approach; pollution control; stabilization",,,,,,"Edmonds, Barns, Factors affecting the long-term cost of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions reductions (1992) International Journal of Global Energy Issues, 4 (3), pp. 140-166; Energy Modeling Forum (EMF), (1993) Reducing Global Carbon Emissions: Costs and Policy Options, , Stanford University, Stanford, CA, EMF-12; IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Maier-Reimer, Hasselmann, Transport and storage of carbon dioxide in the ocean an inorganic ocean-circulation carbon cycle model (1987) Climate Dynamics, 2 (2), pp. 63-90; Manne, Richels, (1992) Buying Greenhouse Insurance: The Economic Costs of Carbon Dioxide Emission Limits, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Manne, Richels, The costs of stabilizing global CO2 emissions: a probabilistic analysis based on expert judgments (1994) The Energy Journal, 15 (1), pp. 31-56; Nordhaus, (1979) The Efficient Use of Energy Resources, , Yale University Press, New Haven, CT; Post, Peng, Emanuel, King, Dale, DeAngelis, The global carbon cycle (1990) American Scientist, 78 (4), pp. 310-326; Wigley, Balancing the carbon budget: the implications for projections of future carbon dioxide concentration changes (1993) Tellus, 45 B (5), pp. 409-425","Richels, R.; Energy Analysis and Planning Department, Electric Power Research Institute, 3412 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94303, United States",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029529428
