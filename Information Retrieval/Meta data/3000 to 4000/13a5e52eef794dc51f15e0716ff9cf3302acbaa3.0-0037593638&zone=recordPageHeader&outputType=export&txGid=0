Eco-regions are large ecosystems of regional extent that contain smaller ecosystems of similar response potential and resource production capabilities. They can be used as a geographical framework for organizing and reporting resource information, setting bioecological recovery criteria, extrapolating site-level management, and monitoring global change. The objective of this research is to develop a quantitative, multivariate regionalization model that is capable of delineating eco-regions at multiple levels from remotely sensed information and other environmental and natural resources spatial data. The Spatial Pattern Analysis Model developed in this study uses a region-growing algorithm to generate spatially contiguous regions from primitive polygonal land units. The algorithm merges the most similar pair of neighbouring units at each iteration, based on satisfying certain similarity criteria unit all units are grouped into one. This model was utilized to develop an eco-region map of Nebraska with three hierarchical levels. In the mapping process, the STATSGO data set was used to build the primitive map units. Environmental parameters included in the model were multi-temporal AVHRR data, soil rooting depth, organic matter content, available water capacity, and long-term annual averages of water balance and growing degree day totals. Development of the model provides a new and useful approach to eco-region mapping for resource managers and researchers. The method is automated and efficient, reduces the judgement biases and uncertainty of manual analyses, and can be replicated for other regions or for the regionalization of other themes.",,"ecoregion; GIS; mapping; spatial analysis; United States",,,,,,"Anderson, R.L., Aiken, R.M., Sinclair, H.R., Waltman, S.W., Waltman, W.J., Identifying agroecozones in the Central Great Plains (1998) Abstracts: Fourth International Conference on Precision Agriculture, , St. Paul, MN; Bailey, R.G., Delineation of ecosystem regions (1983) Environment Management, 7, pp. 365-373; Bailey, R.G., Hogg, H.C., A world eco-regions map for resource reporting (1986) Environmental Conservation, 13, pp. 195-202; Bailey, R.G., Collins, F., Zoltai, S.C., Wiken, E.B., Ecological regionalization in Canada and the United States (1985) Geoforum, 16, pp. 265-275; Clarke, S.E., White, D., Schaedel, A.L., Oregon, USA, ecological regions and subregions for water quality management (1991) Environmental Management, 15, pp. 847-856; Daly, C., Neilson, R.P., Phillips, D.L., A statistical-topographic model for mapping climatological precipitation over mountainous terrain (1993) Journal of Applied Meteorology, 33, pp. 140-158; Dreeszen, V.H., (1973) Topographic Regions of Nebraska, , Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska; (1998) North America Land Cover Characteristics Data Base, , EROS Data Center, Version 1.2 release; Eyton, J.R., Digital elevation model perspective plot overlays (1986) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 76, pp. 570-576; Agro-ecological zoning: Guidelines (1996) FAO Soils Bulletin, 73. , FAO Soil Resources Management and Conservation Service, FAO Land and Water Development Division, Rome, Italy; Follett, R.F., Arnold, J., Brodahl, M., Cipra, J., Doraiswamy, P., Elliot, T., Farrell, D., Waltman, S.W., (1996) Determination of Agroecozones in the Continental United States, , ARS Agroecozone Report, Northern Plains Area, Ft.
