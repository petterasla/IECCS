Growth modelling shows that while logarithmic growth is an approximate model for growth, a 3:3 rational polynomial function provides a significantly better fit to growth data for this coral species. Over the period 2002-2007, involving several cycles of sea surface temperature (SST) change, the rate of growth of A. palmata was largely proportional to rate of change of SST, with R2 = 0.935. These results have implications for the influence of global warming and climate change on coral reef ecosystems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
