But effects varied between different agroecological zones. In cool subtropical zones such as Japan and N China, elevation of ambient temperature resulted in a higher risk of blast epidemics. Situations in the humid tropics and warm humid subtropics were opposite to those in cool areas. A low temperature resulted in greater risk of blast epidemics. Yield loss caused by enhanced UV-B was normally at 9-10%, independent of temperature change; the deviation was much smaller than that caused by blast. Enhanced UV-B would cause much more severe blast when the temperature changes to cooler than normal, especially in tropical countries. -from Authors",,"climatic change; rice leaf blast; risk analysis; ultraviolet-B; China; Japan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029502498
