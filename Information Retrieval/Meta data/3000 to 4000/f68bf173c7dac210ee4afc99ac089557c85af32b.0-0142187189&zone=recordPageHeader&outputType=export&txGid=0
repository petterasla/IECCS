(1) Observations on coral health and water temperature in the subtropical Atlantic (Eleuthera and Cat Island, Bahamas) and Indian Ocean (Sodwana Bay, South Africa) suggest a link between cool water delivered by upwelling and coral health. After the 1998 bleaching event, caused by strong SST anomalies, coral health and recovery from the previous year's bleaching was significantly better on the narrow southern Cat Island shelf (70% of corals healthy) where the presence of cold water was observed, which was attributed to small-scale upwelling, than on the wide northern Eleuthera shelf (44% of corals healthy), where downwelling of hot bank waters was believed to have damaged corals. In South Africa, regular, short-term upwelling events in five summers reduced SST to well below bleaching level. (2) In the northern Red Sea (Safaga Bay) and in South Africa (Sodwana Bay), wide areas with either coral frameworks or non-framework communities exist. Calculations show that if the top 10 m (20 m) of the ocean became inhospitable to corals, still 50.4% (17.5%) of the coral area would remain intact in the Red Sea and 99% (40%) in South Africa. (3) Offshore bank and island reefs investigated in the Turks, Caicos, and Mouchoir Banks and Grand and Little Cayman showed high rates of mortality and coral diseases. The most remote sites (Mouchoir Bank) were not the healthiest. Refuge areas appear to exist in (1) and (2), but in (3) only if vigorous water-circulation is encountered.","Bahamas; Cayman Islands; Coral reef; Red Sea; Reef health; Refuge; Sea surface temperature; South Africa; Upwelling","coral reef; environmental stress; mass mortality; refuge; sea surface temperature; upwelling; Bahamas; Cayman Islands; Red Sea; South Africa",,,,,,"Alker, A.P., Smith, G.W., Kim, K., Characterisation of Aspergillus sydowii (Thum et Church), a fungal pathogen of Caribbean sea fan corals (2001) Hydrobiologia, 460, pp. 105-111; Angel, M.V., Baars, M.A., Barber, R.T., Chavez, F.P., Kastner, M., Leinen, M., Lutjeharms, J.R.E., Shimmield, G.B., Group report: How do open ocean upwelling systems operate as integrated physical, chemical, and biological systems and influence the geological record (1994) Upwelling in the Ocean: Modern Processes and Ancient Records, pp. 193-219. , Summerhayes CP, Emeis K-C, Angel MV, Smith RL, Zeitschel B (eds) Wiley, Chichester; Antonius, A., Pathologic syndromes on reef corals: A review (1995) Coral Reefs in the Past, the Present and the Future, 29, pp. 161-169. , Geister J, Lathuillere B (eds) Proc 2nd Eur Regional Meeting, ISRS, Publ Serv Geol Lux; Aronson, R.B., Precht, W.F., Macintyre, I.G., Extrinsic control of species replacement on a Holocene reef in Belize: The role of coral diseases (1998) Coral Reefs, 17, pp. 223-230; Baker, A.C., Reef corals bleach to survive change (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 765-766; Blanchon, P., Jones, B., Hurricane control on shelf-edge reef architecture around Grand Cayman (1997) Sedimentology, 44, pp. 479-506; Blanchon, P., Jones, B., Kalbfleisch, W., Anatomy of a fringing reef around Grand Cayman: Storm rubble, not coral framework (1997) J Sediment Res, 67, pp. 1-16; Buddemeier, R.W., Is it time to give up?
