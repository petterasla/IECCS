Large-scale climatic oscillations, like ENSO, PDO, NAO, and the global warming trend are associated with regional hydrologic variation. Ten types of climate indices were gathered and analyzed to investigate their influence on seasonal precipitation variation in the basin based on a linear correlation analysis and an influence index analysis. The influence index was developed in this study to measure the effect of climate variation on the seasonal precipitation in the basin. The statistical evidence achieved in this study confirms that the Colorado River Basin is subjected to the phase of climate variation. The strength of the seasonal response of precipitation to the climate variation varies in different localities in the basin. The methods of analysis used in this study were proposed in the hope that progress in understanding and modeling dynamic climatic systems can result in developing a valuable long-term forecasting model for water resources management. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"Climatic system; Forecasting model; Index analysis; Seasonal precipitation; Climate change; Correlation methods; Global warming; Mathematical models; Rivers; Weather forecasting; Precipitation (meteorology); climate effect; climate modeling; climate variation; correlation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; North Atlantic Oscillation; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; precipitation (climatology); seasonality; Colorado Basin; North America",,,,,,"Bonan, G., (2002) Ecological Climatology: Concepts and Applications, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Cayan, D.R., Redmond, K.T., Riddle, L.G., ENSO and hydrologic extremes in the western United States (1999) J Clim, 12, pp. 2881-2893; Chiew, F.H.S., Piechota, T.C., Dracup, F.A., McMahon, T.A., El Niño/southern oscillation and Australian rainfall, streamflow and drought: Links and potential for forecasting (1998) J Hydrol, 204, pp. 138-149; Cordery, I., McCall, M., A model for forecasting drought from teleconnections (2000) Water Resour Res, 36 (3), pp. 763-768; Dracup, J.A., Kahya, E., The relationships between U.S. streamflow and La Niña (1994) Water Resour Res, 30 (7), pp. 2133-2141; Elsner, J.B., Tsonis, A.A., Nonlinear dynamics established in the ENSO (1993) Geophys Res Lett, 20, pp. 213-216; Gutiérrez, F., Dracup, J.A., An analysis of the feasibility of long-range streamflow forecasting for Colombia using El Niño-Southern Oscillation indicators (2001) J Hydrol, 246, pp. 181-196; Hamlet, A.F., Lettenmaier, D.P., Columbia River streamflow forecasting based on ENSO and PDO climate signals (1999) J Wat Resour Plann Manage ASCE, 125 (6), pp. 333-341; Hoerling, M.P., Kumar, A., Zhang, M., El Niño, La Niña and the non-linearity of their teleconnections (1997) J Clim, 10, pp. 1769-1786; Hu, Q., Feng, S., Variations of teleconnection of ENSO and interannual variation in summer rainfall in the central United States (2001) J Clim, 14, pp. 2469-2480; Jones, P.D., Jónsson, T., Wheeler, D., Extension to the North Atlantic Oscillation using early instrumental pressure observations from Gibraltar and south-west Iceland (1997) Int J Climatol, 17, pp. 1433-1450; Kahya, E., Dracup, J.A., U.S. streamflow patterns in relation to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (1993) Water Resour Res, 29 (8), pp. 2491-2503; Kahya, E., Dracup, J.A., The influences of type I El Niño and La Niña events on streamflows in the Pacific Southwest of the United States (1994) J Clim, 7, pp. 965-976; Kim, Y.S., Moon, Y.J., Shin, H.S., Kim, Y.S., Seo, B.C., Kim, H.T., (1998) Analysis of El-Nino/La-Nina Influence and Development of the Comprehensive Counter Plan on Natural Disasters, , (in Korean).
