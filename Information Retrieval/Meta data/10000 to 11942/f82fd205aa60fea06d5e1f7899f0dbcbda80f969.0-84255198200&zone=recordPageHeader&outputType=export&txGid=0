Concerns on outdoor thermal conditions are on the rise judging by the growing number of research on the subject. However empirical research in the context of urban outdoor in moderate and dry climate is still limited. Predicting thermal comfort of outdoor spaces in a particular setting is essential to ensure continuous return of visitors and users. This paper aims to establish the thermal acceptable temperature range applicable for an urban context in temperate and dry climate zone based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) index. Two fieldwork experiments were conducted through environmental measurements and questionnaire survey performed in winter of 2009 and summer of 2010 at a public square in Esfahan, Iran. These data were used for the thermal comfort assessment, supported by the RayMan model for the calculation of the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) and PET. The study established the acceptable thermal comfort range to be between 12.3 and 30.9 deg C which is relatively wider then past studies. © 2011 IEEE.","acceptable range; outdoor; RayMan model; thermal comfort; thermal indices","acceptable range; Empirical research; Environmental measurements; Mean radiant temperature; outdoor; Outdoor space; Physiologically equivalent temperatures; Questionnaire surveys; Temperature range; Thermal condition; Thermal index; Urban context; Urban outdoor; Zone-based; Industrial applications; Surveys; Thermal comfort",,,,,,"Ahmed, K.S., Comfort in urban spaces: Defining the boundaries of outdoor thermal comfort for the tropical urban environments (2003) Energy and Buildings, 35 (1), pp. 103-110. , DOI 10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00085-3, PII S0378778802000853; Kariminia, S., Outdoor thermal comfort of two public squares in temperate and dry region of Esfahan, Iran (2010) Science and Social Research (CSSR), pp. 1266-1271. , 2010 International Conference on; Handbook, A., (2005) Fundamentals: American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers, , Inc.
