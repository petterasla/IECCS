Comparing access, metro, and core, the access constitutes a substantial part of the per subscriber network energy consumption and is regarded as the bottleneck for increased network energy efficiency. One of the main opportunities for reducing network energy consumption lies in efficiency improvements of the customer premises equipment. Access networks in general are designed for low utilization while supporting high peak access rates. The combination of large contribution to overall network power consumption and low utilization implies large potential for CPE power saving modes where functionality is powered off during periods of idleness. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Access network; Customer premises equipment; Efficiency improvement; Energy consumption; Gigabit-capable passive optical networks; Network costs; Network power; Power saving modes; Energy utilization; Fiber optic networks; Global warming; Energy efficiency",,,,,,"IEEE 802.3av Task Force, , http://www.ieee802.org/3/av; ITU-T G.987.x Series of Recs, , http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G/e; ITU-T Rec.
