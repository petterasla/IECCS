One approach to addressing this problem is to recycle CO 2 directly into fuels or chemicals using photosynthesis. Here we genetically engineered Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 to produce isobutyraldehyde and isobutanol directly from CO 2 and increased productivity by overexpression of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Isobutyraldehyde is a precursor for the synthesis of other chemicals, and isobutanol can be used as a gasoline substitute. The high vapor pressure of isobutyraldehyde allows in situ product recovery and reduces product toxicity. The engineered strain remained active for 8 d and produced isobutyraldehyde at a higher rate than those reported for ethanol, hydrogen or lipid production by cyanobacteria or algae. These results underscore the promise of direct bioconversion of CO 2 into fuels and chemicals, which bypasses the need for deconstruction of biomass. © 2009 Nature America, Inc.
