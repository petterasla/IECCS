Energy Conservation is now recognised as one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways of limiting or reducing CO2 emissions. Large UK companies are now assessing how much CO2 they dissipate to the environment and reviewing strategies to reduce this either in response to consumer demand or as a corporate policy decision. Computer-based information systems already exist to monitor and report on fluctuations in energy consumption. These are called Monitoring and Targeting (M &amp; T) systems. This paper explains what M &amp; T systems are and how they are being extended to cover reporting on corporate fuel-based CO2 emissions to help provide an integrated energy and environmental-management information system. © 1992.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Management information systems; Monitoring and targeting (M & T) systems; United Kingdom; Energy conservation; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental management; greenhouse gas; monitoring and targeting system; UK",,,,,,"Butler, Monitoring and targeting as an information system (1989) Energy Manager; (1986) Monitoring and Targeting for Energy Efficiency, , Energy Efficiency Office; Brookes, A question of survival (1989) Energy in Buildings; Boyle, Living in, and coping with, the greenhouse (1990) Energy in Buildings; Hitchin, (1981) Building Services Engng Res. & Technol., 2 (2); (1982) Measurement of energy consumption and comparison with targets for existing buildings and services, , CIBS Energy Code Part 4; Martin, Sweeting, Energy monitoring and targeting by microcomputer (1986) Energy World","Martin, P.K.; Energy Auditing Agency Limited, 22 Forum, Rockingham Drive, Linford Wood, Milton Keynes, MK14 6LY, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.
