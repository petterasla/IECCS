For warmer climates, it was found that snow accumulation would be substantially reduced, and the river's high flow season would shift from the spring to the winter. Potential evaporation would increase throughout the year (mostly in the summer), but peak actual evaporation would shift to the late spring and early summer, due to reduced summer soil moisture. The effect of the streamflow pattern that would accompany a warmer climate was tested on small and moderate sized hypothetical multi-purpose reservoirs. The results showed that water supply reliability would be significantly degraded by the earlier spring runoff pattern that would accompany a warmer climate, especially for small reservoirs. -from Authors",,"global warming; hydrological cycle; reservoir system; seasonal variability; water management; water resource; USA, Washington, American River",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027060383
