We describe the Mexican food system today and how economic policy has influenced food output in efforts to attain food security based on the goal of national self-sufficiency. We examine the impact of climate variability on agricultural production; the ways in which agricultural policy has interacted with climate to change vulnerability to environmental and social change and the implications of global warming for the future of Mexican agriculture. Finally, we discuss the implications of the changing economic environment as Mexico has opened its economy - for example, through the North American Free Trade Agreement. Our goal is to provide a context for thinking about the implications of two types of global change for Mexico - the internationalization of economies and the widespread transformation of the environment. © 1994.","Agricultural Policy; Climate Change; Mexico","agricultural policy; climate change; economic liberalisation; food security; maize production; Mexico; Zea mays",,,,,,"Appendini, (1992) De la Milpa los Tortibonos: La reslructuración de la política Alimentaria en México, , El Colegio de México; Austin, Esteva, (1987) Food Policy in Mexico: The Search for Self-Sufficiency, , Cornell University Press, Ithaca; Borza, Leichenko, Liverman, The impacts of climatic and economic change on irrigation districts in northern Mexico (1993) Association of American Geographers Annual Conference, , presentations at the, Atlanta, Georgia (April); Calva, (1988) Crisis Agricola y Alimentaria en México 1982–1988, , Fontamara, Mexico; Dilley, Climate Change and Agricultural Transformation in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico (1993) PhD dissertation, , Department of Geography, Penn State University; Dovring, Land Reform and Productivity in Mexico (1970) Land Economics, 46 (3), pp. 264-274; Eckstein, (1966) El Ejido Colectivo en México, , Fondo de Cultural Económica, México; Florescano, Precios del maíz y crisis agricolas en México 1708–1810 (1969) México DF: Ediciones Era; Hewitt, Alcántara, (1976) Modernizing Mexican Agriculture, , United Nations Institute for Research on Society and Development (UNIRSD), Geneva; Hewitt, de Alcántara, (1992) Reestructuración Ecónomica y subsistencia rural.
