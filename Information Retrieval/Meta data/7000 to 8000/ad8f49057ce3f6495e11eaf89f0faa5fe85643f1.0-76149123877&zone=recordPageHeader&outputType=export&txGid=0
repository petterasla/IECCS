The authors identify principles for urban models and travel models, as applied to countywide land use plans and transportation plans. Two urban models, UPlan (a simple one) and PECAS (a complex one) were developed by the authors and are outlined here. The energy use and GHG impacts calculator, which will take as an input floor space data from UPlan or PECAS, is described. The methods used in this calculator and how it will be applied within the two urban models are described. The UPlan implementation is described in detail and an example given. Finally, the limits of UPlan are identified and an explanation for how PECAS may be able to perform all of the economic evaluations called for in the California Climate Act is provided.",,"California; Economic evaluations; Energy use; Floor space; In-buildings; Land-use plan; Transportation plans; Travel models; Urban model; Urban modeling; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Land use; Mathematical instruments; Global warming",,,,,,"Walker, W.T., Gao, S., Johnston, R.A., UPlan: Geographic information system as framework for integrated land use planning model (2007) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1994, pp. 117-127. , Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C; Thorne, J.H., Gao, S., Hollander, A.D., Kennedy, J.A., McCoy, M., Johnston, R.A., Quinn, J.F., Modeling potential species richness and Urban buildout to identify mitigation sites along a california highway (2006) Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 11 (4), pp. 277-291; Merenlender, A.M., Brooks, C., Shabazian, D., Gao, S., Johnston, R.A., Forecasting exurban development to evaluate the influence of land- use policies on wildland and farmland conservation (2005) Journal of Conservation Planning, 1 (1), pp. 64-88; Johnston, R.A., McCoy, M., Kirn, M., Fell, M., Streamlining the National environmental policy act process through cooperative local-state-federal transportation and land use planning (2004) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1880, pp. 135-143. , Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C; Johnston, R.A., Shabazian, D.R., Gao, S., UPlan: A versatile Urban growth model for transportation planning (2003) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1831, pp. 202-209. , Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C; Wegener, M., Operational Urban models: State of the art (1994) Journal of the American Planning Association, 60 (1), pp. 17-29; Hunt, J.D., Johnston, R.R., Abraham, J.E., Rodier, C.J., Garry, G., Putman, S.H., De La Barra, T., Comparisons from sacramento model test bed (2001) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1780, pp. 53-63. , TRB, National Research Council, Washington, D.C; (2008) Making the Land Use Connection: Regional What-If Scenario Analysis, , Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, Philadelphia, Penn; (2004) California Statewide Residential Appliance Saturation Study, , CEC- 300-00-004.
