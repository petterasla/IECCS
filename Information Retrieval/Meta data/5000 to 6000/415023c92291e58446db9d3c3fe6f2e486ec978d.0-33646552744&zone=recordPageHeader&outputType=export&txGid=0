Along the slopes of the San Francisco Peaks of Arizona, USA, I transferred intact soil cores from a spruce-fir to a ponderosa pine forest 730 m lower in elevation to assess the potential impacts of climate change on soil N cycling and trace gas fluxes. The low-elevation site has a mean annual soil temperature about 2.5°C higher than the high-elevation site. Net rates of N transformations and trace gas fluxes were measured in high-elevation soil cores incubated in situ and soil cores transferred to the low-elevation site. Over a 13-month period, volumetric soil water content was similar in transferred soil cores relative to soil cores incubated in situ. Net N mineralization and nitrification increased over 80% in transferred soil cores compared with in situ soil cores. Soil transfer significantly increased net CO2 efflux (120%) and net CH4 consumption (90%) relative to fluxes of these gases from soil cores incubated in situ. Soil net N2O fluxes were relatively low and were not generally altered by soil transfer. Although the soil microbial biomass as a whole decreased in transferred soil cores compared with in situ soil cores after the incubation period, active bacterial biomass increased. Transferring soil cores from the low-elevation to the high-elevation site (i.e. simulated global cooling) commonly, but not consistently, resulted in the opposite effects on soil pools and processes. In general, soil containment (root trenching) did not significantly affect soil measurements. My results suggest that small increases in mean annual temperature can have large impacts on soil N cycling, soil-atmosphere trace gas exchanges, and soil microbial communities even in ecosystems where water availability is a major limiting resource. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Altitudinal transect; Carbon dioxide; Coniferous forest; Global warming; Methane; Microbial biomass; Nitrification; Nitrogen loss; Nitrogen mineralization; Nitrous oxide","arid environment; biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; coniferous forest; forest; global warming; greenhouse gas; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen oxides; soil water; Abies; Bacteria (microorganisms); Picea",,,,,,"Adamsen, A.P.S., King, G.M., Methane consumption in temperate and subarctic forest soils: Rates, vertical zonation and responses to water and nitrogen (1993) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 59, pp. 485-490; Babiuk, L.A., Paul, E.A., The use of fluorescein isothiocyanate in the determination of the bacterial biomass of grassland soils (1970) Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 16, pp. 57-62; BassiriRad, H., Kinetics of nutrient uptake by roots: Responses to global change (2000) New Phytologist, 147, pp. 155-169; Billings, W.D., Luken, J.O., Mortensen, D.A., Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide: Possible effects on arctic tundra (1983) Oecologia, 58, pp. 286-289; Birkeland, P.W., (1999) Soils and Geomorphology, , 3rd Edn.
