A field study was conducted to (i) determine the effect of soil characteristics resulting from changes in soil management practices on CO 2 flux from the soil surface to the atmosphere in transitional land from perennial forages to annual crops, and (ii) develop empirical relationships that predict CO 2 flux from soil temperature and soil water content. The CO 2 flux, soil temperature (T s), volumetric soil water content (θ v) were measured every 1-2 weeks in no-till (NT) and conventional till (CT) malt barley and undisturbed soil grass-alfalfa (UGA) systems in a Lihen sandy loam soil (sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplustoll) under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in western North Dakota. Soil air-filled porosity (ε) was calculated from total soil porosity and θ v measurements. Significant differences in CO 2 fluxes between land management practices (irrigation and tillage) were observed on some measurement dates. Higher CO 2 fluxes were detected in CT plots than in NT and UGA treatments immediately after rainfall or irrigation. Soil CO 2 fluxes increased with increasing soil moisture (R 2=0.15, P&lt;0.01) while an exponential relationship was found between CO 2 emission and T s (R 2=0.59). Using a stepwise regression analysis procedure, a significant multiple regression equation was developed between CO 2 flux and θ v, T s (CO 2flux = e - 3.477 + 0.123 Ts + 6.381 θv ; R 2=0.68, P≤0.01). Not surprisingly, soil temperature was a driving factor in the equation, which accounted for approximately 59% in variation of CO 2 flux. It was concluded that less intensive tillage, such as no-till or strip tillage, along with careful irrigation management will reduce soil CO 2 evolution from land being converted from perennial forages to annual crops.","Soil air-filled porosity;
