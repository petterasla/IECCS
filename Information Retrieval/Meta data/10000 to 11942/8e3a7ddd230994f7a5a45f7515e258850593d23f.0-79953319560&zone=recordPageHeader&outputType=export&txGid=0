A wide coalition of countries in international climate change agreements could be facilitated by the perceived fairness of rich and poor countries of the abatement sharing at international level. In this paper I use two popular climate change integrated assessment models to investigate the path and decompose components and sources of future inequality in the emissions distribution. Results prove to be consistent with previous empirical studies and robust to model comparison and show that gaps in GDP across world regions will still play a crucial role in explaining different countries contributions to global warming. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Emissions; Inequality; Integrated assessment","Climate Change Agreements; Copenhagen; Emissions; Empirical studies; Global emissions; Inequality; Integrated assessment; Integrated assessment models; Model comparison; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Global warming; Integration; Rating; Climate models; climate change; emission control; emission inventory; future prospect; global warming; Gross Domestic Product; international agreement; model test; model validation; pollution policy",,,,,,"Blanford, G., R&D investment strategy for climate change (2009) Energy Economics, 31, pp. S27-S36; Bosello, F., Roson, R., Carbon emissions trading and equity in international agreements (2002) Environmental Modelling and Assessment, 7, pp. 29-37; Bosetti, V., Galeotti, M., Lanza, A., How consistent are alternative short term climate policies with long term goals?
