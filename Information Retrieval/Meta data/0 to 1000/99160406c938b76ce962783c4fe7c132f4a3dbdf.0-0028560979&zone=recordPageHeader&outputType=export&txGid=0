Summary statistics of EMWTs were tabulated and mean EMWT was mapped at a large scale. Linear and polynomial regression were utilized to examine the time series. EMWTs have not warmed during the climatic record of this variable. There does not appear to be a link between EMWTs in Ohio and the increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. -from Author",,"annual minimum temperature; extreme minimum winter temperature; temperature; USA, Ohio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00300950,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028560979
