They will be higher by 100-150 mm in chestnut, cinnamonic, and brown semidesertic soils. The maximum summer drying is thought to result in a decrease of water reserves by 30-50 mm in tundra soils and by 50-80 mm in taiga ones. There will be no changes in steppe zone while, in dry-steppe, water reserves will increase by 20-60 mm. If the mean global temperature rises by 2°C, water reserves will be the same as in the previous case in spring, whereas a decrease by 40-60 mm in summer is probable for sod-podzolic soils and an increase by 50-60 mm may be expected in the dry-steppe zone.","Eastern Europe; Example forecast; Global climatic warming; Soil water reserves","climate change; global warming; soil water; Europe, (East)",,,,,,"Beydeman, I.N., (1983) Spravochnik po Raskhodu Vody Rasteniyami v Prirodnykh Zonakh SSSR (Reference Book of Water Uptake by the Plants in Geographic Zones of the USSR), , Nauka, Moscow; Budyko, M.I., Vinnikov, K.Ya., Twenty-five years of studying anthropogenic changes of global climate (1986) Meteorologiya i Gidrologiya, (10), pp. 5-17; Velichko, A.A., Global climate changes and the reaction of the landscape sphere (1991) Izvestiya AN (Information Bulletin of Academy of Sciences), 5, pp. 5-22; Velichko, A.A., Zonal and macro-regional changes in landscape-climatic conditions caused by the ""greenhouse"" effect (1992) Izvestiya AN (Information Bulletin of Academy of Sciences), (2), pp. 89-101. , Series Geography; Velichko, A.A., Grichuk, V.P., Gurtovaya, Ye.Ye., Zelikson, E.M., Paleo-climate on the territory of the USSR during the optimum of the last (Mikulinskoye) inter-glacial period (1983) Izvestiya AN SSSR (Information Bulletin of Academy of Sciences of the USSR), (6), pp. 30-45; Velichko, A.A., Klimanov, V.A., Climatic conditions of the northern hemisphere 5-6 millennia ago (1990) Izvestiya AN SSSR (Information Bulletin of Academy of Sciences of the USSR), (5), pp. 38-52. , Series Geography; Vinnikov, K.Ya., Lemeshko, N.A., Soil moisture content and runoff on the territory of the USSR in case of global warming (1987) Meteorologiya i Gidrologiya, (12), pp. 96-103; Voronin, A.D., Karpachevskiy, L.O., Developing the ideas of G.N.
