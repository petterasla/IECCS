These problems may be identified linguistically on a logical basis to take the necessary precautions, and implement mitigation strategies after vulnerability possibilities are assessed using fuzzy logic. Climate change effects are the focus of many scientific, engineering, economic, social, cultural, and global nuisances, and these effects awaits cost-effective remedial solutions. Extreme events such as floods and droughts and modified groundwater recharge may be influenced by climate change. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Climate change; Droughts; Floods; Groundwater; Impact; Variation; Water resources","Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Competition; Drought; Economic and social effects; Floods; Fuzzy logic; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Underground reservoirs; Demand and supplies; Extreme events; Ground water recharges; Impact; Mitigation strategies; Variation; Groundwater resources; drought; flood; global warming; greenhouse effect; mitigation; water resource",,,,,,"Al-Sefry, S.Ş., Al-Ghamdi, Z.S.A., Al-Ashi, W., Al-Baradi, W., (2004) Strategic ground water storage of Wadi Fatimah-Makkah region Saudi Arabia, , Saudi Geological Survey, Hydrogeology Project Team, Final Report; Bazuhair, A.S., Nassief, M.O., Al-Yamani, M.S., Sharaf, M.A., Bayumi, T.H., Ali, S., (2002), p. 389. , King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology RiyadhBoken, V.K., Shaykewich, C.F., Improving an operational wheat yield model for the Canadian Prairies using phenological-stage-based normalized difference vegetation index (2002) Int J Remote Sens, 23, pp. 4157-4170. , 20; Eckhardt, K., Ulbrich, U., Potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge and streamflow in a central European low mountain range (2003) J Hydrol, 284, pp. 244-252; Climate change 2001: the scientific basis (2001) Contribution of working group I to the third assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, p. 881. , IPCC Houghton JT, Ding Y, Griggs DJ, Noguer M, van der Linden PJ, Dai X, Maskell K, Johnson CA (eds) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Kundzewicz, Z.W., Mata, L.J., Arnell, N.W., P.
