This may affect both populations' total reproductive output and the link between population demography and recruitment, yet detailed information on fecundity regulation is generally lacking for marine fishes. We therefore examined associations between liver energy, oocyte stage, leading cohort oocyte size (LC20), atresia and fecundity for the Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) Gadus morhua L. from 2006 to 2008 in a comprehensive field and laboratory study. The relationship between the relative liver size (hepatosomatic index, HSI) and specific liver energy content was best described by an asymptotic curve, increasing rapidly at first, then levelling of at HSI &gt; 6%. LC20 increased towards the spawning season, but was also positively associated with total length. At present there is thus a tendency towards larger NEAC females spawning earlier. The incidence of atresia was highest during the advanced yolk granule stage. Only 1% of females that reached an LC20 &gt; 300 μm absorbed all oocytes and thereby aborted spawning. Potential fecundity showed a parabolic relationship with LC 20, peaking around 614 μm, i.e. approximately on February 1st, and was positively associated with weight, liver energy and, presently, age. In summary, NEAC females that start vitellogenesis will likely spawn. Atresia and fecundity down-regulation appears only to become pronounced close to spawning. Finally, the size-dependent spawning time, which appears to have emerged in the stock recently, may alter the link between population demography and recruitment. © Inter-Research 2010.","Atresia; Fecundity regulation; Gadus morhua; Liver energy; Size-dependent spawning time","age structure; bioenergetics; ecosystem dynamics; fecundity; fishing; gadoid; marine ecosystem; recruitment (population dynamics); reproductive productivity; size at maturity; water temperature; Boreogadus; Gadus morhua; Pisces",,,,,,"Clark, C.W., Mangel, M., (2000) Dynamic State Variable Models in Ecology, , Oxford University Press, New York; Cushing, D.H., The natural regulations of populations (1974) Sea Fisheries Research, pp. 399-412. , Harden Jones FR ed, Elek Science, London; Cushing, D.H., Fountain, R.K., Marine ecology and fisheries (1975) Cambrigde University Press, New York DeMartini EE, 79, pp. 547-560; Dutil, J.D., Lambert, Y., Natural mortality from poor condition in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) (2000) Can.
