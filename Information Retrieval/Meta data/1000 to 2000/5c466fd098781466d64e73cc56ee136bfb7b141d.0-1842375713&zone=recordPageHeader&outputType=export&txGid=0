Recently the importance of CH4 as a greenhouse gas has been recognized and studies have been carried put to asses its contribution to global warming. In this paper we show that atmospheric CH4 is produced by a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic processes. Then, we discuss mainly production, consumption and emission of CH4 in paddy fields. Finally, we provide an estimate of the mitigation potential in agricultural systems including rice production, ruminant animals and animal waste.","Animal waste; Emission mitigation; Enteric fermentation; Global warming; Methane; Organic matter management; Rice paddies; Water management","Water management; Agricultural wastes; Atmospheric composition; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Waste utilization; methane; agriculture; air pollution; bovids; conference paper; greenhouse effect; rice",,"methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Houghton, J.T., Callander, B.A., Varney, S.K., (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, pp. 23-46. , Cambridge Univ.
