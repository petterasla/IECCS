While efficiency and technology options have been extensively studied within the context of climate change mitigation, this paper addresses the possible role of price-related energy-service demand reduction. For this analysis, the elastic demand version of the TIAM-UCL global energy system model is used in combination with decomposition analysis. The results of the CO2 emission decomposition indicate that a reduction in energy-service demand can play a limited role, contributing around 5% to global emission reduction in the 21st century. A look at the sectoral level reveals that the demand reduction can play a greater role in selected sectors like transport contributing around 16% at a global level. The societal welfare loss is found to be high when the price elasticity of demand is low. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 emission reduction; Energy system modelling; Energy-service demand","Carbon fuels; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Decomposition analysis; Demand reduction; Elastic demand; Emission reduction; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy system modelling; Energy-service demand; Global climate changes; Global emissions; Global energy system models; Global levels; Low carbon; Price-elasticity of demand; Structural change; Technology options; Welfare loss; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost accounting; Elasticity; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; decomposition analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; modeling; price dynamics",,,,,,"Agnolucci, P., Ekins, P., Iacopini, G., Anderson, K., Bows, A., Mander, S., Shackley, S., Different scenarios for achieving radical reduction in carbon emissions: a decomposition analysis (2009) Ecological Economics, 68, pp. 1652-1666; Anandarajah, G., Kesicki, F., Pye, S., Carbon tax vs. cap-and-trade: implications on developing countries emissions (2010), Proceedings of the International Association for Energy Economics International Conference.
