All simulations use realistic, smoothed topography and monthly averaged climatological forcings. Our comparison of the results emphasizes large-scale features relevant to global climate change. Since neither the 1° × 1° simulation nor the 4° × 2° simulations resolves ocean eddies, our results do not address the possible importance of resolving eddies in ocean-climate simulations. There are significant differences between the 1° × 1° and 4° × 2° simulations, most notably in the Arctic Ocean. However, the large-scale features of the model solutions are very similar at the two resolutions and in many cases are more sensitive to a large difference in horizontal viscosity than to the difference in resolution. This suggests that other approaches to improving the solution of ocean-climate models will be more effective than increases in horizontal resolution outside the eddy-resolving regime.","Equilibrium solution; Ocean model; Resolution; Sea ice model","climate variation; global ocean; mesoscale eddy; oceanic general circulation model; sea ice",,,,,,"Bryan, K., Accelerating the convergence to equilibrium of ocean climate models (1984) J.
