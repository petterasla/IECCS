Estimates for the likelihood of future climate changes in Taiwan were made based on the projection from the IPCC climate models. In the past 100 years, Taiwan experienced an island-wide warming trend (1.0-1.4°C/100 years). Both the annual and daily temperature ranges have also increased. The warming in Taiwan is closely connected to a large-scale circulation and SAT fluctuations, such as the ""cool ocean warm land"" phenomenon. The water vapor pressure has increased significantly and could have resulted in a larger temperature increase in summer. The probability for the occurence of high temperatures has increased and the result suggests that both the mean and variance in the SAT in Taiwan have changed significantly since the beginning of the 20th century. Although, as a whole, the precipitation in Taiwan has shown a tendency to increase in northern Taiwan and to decrease in southern Taiwan in the past 100 years, it exhibits a more complicated spatial pattern. The changes occur mainly in either the dry or rainy season and result in an enhanced seasonal cycle. The changes in temperature and precipitation are consistent with the weakening of the East Asian monsoon. Under consideration of both the warming effect from greenhouse gases and the cooling effect from aerosols, all projections from climate models indicated a warmer climate near Taiwan in the future. The projected increase in the area-mean temperature near Taiwan ranged from 0.9-2.7°C relative to the 1961-1990 averaged temperature, when the CO 2 concentration increased to 1.9 times the 1961-1990 level. These simulated temperature increases were statistically significant and can be attributed to the radiative forcing associated with the increased concentration of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The projected changes in precipitation were within the range of natural variability for all five models. There is no evidence supporting the possibility of precipitation changes near Taiwan based on the simulations from five IPCC climate models.",,"climate change; global warming; precipitation assessment; Taiwan",,,,,,"Allan, R., Lindesay, J., Parker, D., (1996) El Niño Southern Oscillation and Climate Variability, , CSIRO Publishing, Australia, 405 pp; Cane, M.A., Clement, A.C., Kaplan, A., Kushnir, Y., Pozdnyakov, D., Seager, R., Zebiak, S.E., Murtugudde, R., Twentieth-century sea-surface temperature trends (1997) Science, 275, pp. 957-960; Hansen, J., Ruedy, R., Glascoe, J., Sato, M., GISS analysis of surface temperature change (1999) J Geophys Res, 104, pp. 30997-31022; Hu, Z.-Z., Bengston, L., Arpe, K., Impact of global warming on the Asian winter monsoon in a coupled GCM (2000) J Geophys Res, 105, pp. 4607-4624; Huffman, G.J., Adler, R.F., Arkin, P.A., Chang, A., Ferraro, R., Gruber, A., Janowiak, J., Schneider, U., The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) combined precipitation dataset (1997) Bull Amer Soc, 78, pp. 5-20; (1996) Climate Change 1995, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Edited by Houghton JT, Meira Filho LG, Callandar BA, Harris N, Kattenberg A, Maskell K.
