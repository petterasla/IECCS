Tap water heating is one promising application for a trans-critical CO2 process. The temperature glide at heat rejection contributes to a very good temperature adaptation when heating tap water, which inherits a large temperature glide. This, together with efficient compression and good heat transfer characteristics of CO2, makes it possible to design very efficient systems. A heating-COP of 4.3 is achieved for the prototype when heating tap water from 9°C to 60°C, at an evaporation temperature of 0°C. The results lead to a seasonal performance factor of about 4 for an Oslo climate, using ambient air as heat source. Thus, the primary energy consumption can be reduced with more than 75% compared with electrical or gas fired systems. Another significant advantage of this system, compared with conventional heat pump water heaters, is that hot water with temperatures up to 90°C can be produced without operational difficulties. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd and IIR.
