M1C 1A4, Canada","Using a permanent first-order stream near Toronto, Ontario, examined the effects of a 2-3.5°C water-temperature increase on densities, biomass, species composition, and life histories of resident stream invertebrates. Changes included: 1) decreased total animal densities, particularly Chironomidae (Diptera); 2) earlier onset of adult insect emergence; 3) increased growth rates and precocious breeding in Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda); 4) smaller size at maturity for Nemoura trispinosa (Plecoptera) and H. azteca; and 5) altered sex ratios for Lepidostoma vernale (Trichoptera). Variation in the responses of individual target species to the manipulation was unexpected and may have been influenced by the genetic structure of local populations. Levels of gene flow among habitats may be critical to the degree of impact seen as a result of large-scale thermal perturbation.",,"emergence; genetic structure; global warming; macroinvertebrate; thermal perturbation; Canada, Ontario, Toronto; Amphipoda; Chironomidae; Diptera; Hyalella azteca; Lepidostoma vernale; Nemoura trispinosa; Nemouridae; Plecoptera; Trichoptera",,,,,,,"Hogg, I.D.; Div. of Life Sci, Univ of Toronto, 1265 Military Trail, Scarborough Ont.
