A compound model, namely ""Straw Returning and Burning Model - Expansion"" (SRBME), was built to estimate the net mitigation potential, economic benefits, and air pollutant reduction of straw returning. Three scenarios, that is, baseline, ""full popularization of straw returning (FP),"" and ""full popularization of straw returning and precision fertilization (FP + P),"" were set to reflect popularization of straw returning. The results of the SRBME indicated that (1) compared with the soil carbon sequestration of 13.37 Tgyr, the net mitigation potentials, which were 6.328 Tgyr for the FP scenario and 9.179 Tgyr for the FP + P scenario, had different trends when the full budget of the greenhouse gases was considered; (2) when the feasibility in connection with greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, economic benefits, and environmental benefits was taken into consideration, straw returning was feasible in 15 provinces in the FP scenario, with a total net mitigation potential of 7.192 TgCeyr and the total benefits of CNY 1.473 billion (USD 216.6 million); (3) in the FP + P scenario, with the implementation of precision fertilization, straw returning was feasible in 26 provinces with a total net mitigation potential of 10.39 TgCeyr and the total benefits of CNY 5.466 billion (USD 803.8 million); (4) any extent of change in the treatment of straw from being burnt to being returned would contribute to air pollution reduction; (5) some countermeasures, such as CH4 reduction in rice paddies, precision fertilization, financial support, education and propaganda, would promote the feasibility of straw returning as a mitigation measure. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.","feasibility; global warming potential; greenhouse gas; methane; mitigation; soil organic carbon; straw returning","fossil fuel; methane; nitric oxide; nitrogen; air pollutant; air pollution; budget; China; cost benefit analysis; economics; fertilization; greenhouse gas; review; rice; straw; air pollution; article; comparative study; crop; energy resource; feasibility study; gas; greenhouse effect; human; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Crops, Agricultural; Energy-Generating Resources; Feasibility Studies; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Humans",,"methane, 74-82-8; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Air Pollutants; Gases",,,,"Ali, M.A., Oh, J.H., Kim, P.J., Evaluation of silicate iron slag amendment on reducing methane emission from flood water rice farming (2008) Agric.
