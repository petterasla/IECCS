W. Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany","Increasing temperatures due to climate change were found to influence abundance and timing of species in numerous ways. Whereas many studies have investigated climate-induced effects on the phenology and abundance of single species, less is known about climate-driven shifts in the diversity and composition of entire communities. Analyses of long-term data sets provide the potential to reveal such relationships. We analysed time series of entire communities of macrozoobenthos in lakes and streams in Northern Europe. There were no direct linear effects of temperature and climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation index) on species composition and diversity, but using multivariate statistics we were able to show that trends in average temperature have already had profound impacts on species composition in lakes. These significant temperature signals on species composition were evident even though we analysed comparatively short time periods of 10-15 years. Future climate shifts may thus induce strong variance in community composition. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Community composition; Diversity; Global warming; Macroinvertebrates; Similarity","fresh water; abundance; climate change; climate effect; climate forcing; community composition; freshwater ecosystem; global warming; macrobenthos; macroinvertebrate; phenology; species diversity; zoobenthos; animal; article; biodiversity; climate; comparative study; Europe; invertebrate; principal component analysis; temperature; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate; Europe; Fresh Water; Invertebrates; Principal Component Analysis; Temperature; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe",,,,,,"Adler, P.B., White, E.P., Lauenroth, W.K., Kaufman, D.M., Rassweiler, A., Rusak, J.A., Evidence for a general species-time-area relationship (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2032-2039; Araújo, M.B., Pearson, R.G., Thuiller, W., Erhard, M., Validation of species-climate impact models under climate change (2005) Glob Change Biol, 11, pp. 1504-1513; Araújo, M.B., Whittaker, R.J., Ladle, R.J., Erhard, M., Reducing uncertainty in projections of extinction risk from climate change (2005) Glob Ecol Biogeogr, 14, pp. 529-538; Beaugrand, G., Reid, P.C., Ibańez, F., Lindley, J.A., Edwards, M., Reorganization of North Atlantic marine copepod biodiversity and climate (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1692-1694; Belgrano, A., Lima, M., Stenseth, N.C., Non-linear dynamics in marine-phytoplankton population systems (2004) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 273, pp. 281-289; Belgrano, A., Lima, M., Stenseth, N.C., Lindahl, O., Responses of phytoplankton communities to climate variability (2004) Marine ecosystems and climate variation, pp. 109-114. , Stenseth NC, Ottersen G, Hurrell JW, Belgrano A eds, Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp; Blenckner, T., Chen, D., Comparison of the impact of regional and North Atlantic atmospheric circulation on an aquatic ecosystem (2003) Clim Res, 23, pp. 131-136; Blenckner, T., Hillebrand, H., North Atlantic Oscillation signatures in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems - a metaanalysis (2002) Glob Change Biol, 8, pp. 203-212; Bradley, D.C., Ormerod, S.J., Community persistence among stream invertebrates tracks the North Atlantic Oscillation (2001) J Anim Ecol, 70, pp. 987-996; Briers, R.A., Gee, J.H.R., Geoghegan, R., Effects of the North Atlantic on growth and phenology of stream insects (2004) Ecography, 27, pp. 811-817; Brittain, J.E., Biology of mayflies (1982) Annu Rev Entomol, 27, pp. 119-147; Brönmark, C., Hansson, L.A., (1996) The biology of lakes and ponds, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Butler, M.G., Life histories of aquatic insects (1984) The ecology of aquatic insects, pp. 24-55. , Resh VH, Rosenberg DM eds, Praeger, New York, pp; Crozier, L., Warmer winters drive butterfly range expansion by increasing survivorship (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 231-241; Davis, A.J., Jenkinson, L.S., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Wood, S., Making mistakes when predicting shifts in species range in response to global warming (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 783-786; Descamps-Julien, B., Gonzalez, A., Stable coexistence in a fluctuating environment: An experimental demonstration (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2815-2824; Drakare, S., Lennon, J.J., Hillebrand, H., The imprint of the geographical, evolutionary and ecological context on species-area relationships (2006) Ecol Lett, 9, pp. 215-227; Drinkwater, K.F., Belgrano, A., Borja, A., Conversi, A., Edwards, M., Greene, C.H., Ottersen, G., Walker, H., The response of marine ecosystems to climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (2003) Geophys Monogr, 134, pp. 211-234; Durant, J.M., Hjermann, D., Anker-Nilssen, T., Beaugrand, G., Mysterud, A., Pettorelli, N., Stenseth, N.C., Timing and abundance as key mechanisms affecting trophic interactions in variable environments (2005) Ecol Lett, 8, pp. 952-958; Fahrig, L., Effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity (2003) Annual Rev Ecol Syst, 34, pp. 487-515; Flöder, S., Burns, C.W., The influence of fluctuating light on diversity and species number of nutrient-limited phytoplankton (2005) J Phycol, 41, pp. 950-956; Fortin, M.-J., Gurevitch, J., Mantel-Tests: Spatial structure in field experiments (1993) Design and analysis of ecological experiments, pp. 342-359. , Schreiner SM, Gurevitch J eds, Chapman & Hall, London, pp; Gotelli NJ, Entsminger GL (2001) EcoSim: Null models software for ecology, v7.0.
