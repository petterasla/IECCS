Nichols 1999). In the present study, groups of Panamanian golden frogs (Atelopus zeteki Dunn, 1993), a critically endangered amphibian thought to be nearly extinct in Panama, were exposed to varying dosages of zoospores of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, temperatures and hydric environments in order to learn whether this species is susceptible to this pathogen and, if so, how environmental factors affect survival. This pathogen proved to be highly lethal for A. zeteki. Frogs exposed to a dosage of 100 Bd zoospores survived significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) longer than those that had been exposed to 10 4 or 10 6 zoospores. Exposed frogs housed at 23 °C survived significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) longer than those that were housed at 17 °C. Exposed frogs held in dry conditions survived significantly longer than those in wet conditions (P &lt; 0.0001). As a laboratory study, these results do not directly test hypotheses about the relation between climate change and the decline of these frogs in the field, but they inform the discussion about how environmental conditions can have an impact on the interaction between a susceptible amphibian and this pathogen. These data do not support the contention that rising global temperatures are necessary to cause the death of amphibians infected with this pathogen because the pathogen was equally lethal at 17 as at 23 °C, and frogs at the warmer temperature lived significantly longer than those at the cooler one. © 2010 ISZS, Blackwell Publishing and IOZ/CAS.","Amphibian declines; Atelopus zeteki; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycosis; Climatelinked-epidemic hypothesis","animal; animal disease; article; Chytridiomycetes; endangered species; greenhouse effect; humidity; microbiology; mortality; mycosis; Panama; polymerase chain reaction; survival; temperature; toad; Animals; Bufonidae; Chytridiomycota; Endangered Species; Global Warming; Humidity; Mycoses; Panama; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Survival Analysis; Temperature; Amphibia; Anura; Atelopus zeteki; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Fungi",,,,,,"Alford, R.A., Richards, S.J., Global amphibian declines: A problem in applied ecology (1999) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 30, pp. 133-165; Alford, R.A., Bradfield, K.S., Richards, S.J., Global warming and amphibian losses (2007) Nature, 447, pp. E3-E4; Alley, R.B., Mayewski, P.A., Sowers, T., Stuiver, M., Taylor, K.C., Clark, P.U., Holocene climatic instability: A prominent, widespread event 8200 yr ago (1997) Geology, 25, pp. 483-486; Andre, S.E., Parker, S.J., Briggs, C.J., Effect of temperature on host response to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infection in the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) (2008) Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 44, pp. 716-720; Annis, S.L., Dastoor, F.P., Ziel, H., Daszak, P., Longcore, J.E., A DNA-based assay identifies Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in amphibians (2004) Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 40, pp. 420-428; Araújo, M.B., Thuiller, W., Pearson, R.G., Climate warming and the decline of amphibians and reptiles in Europe (2006) Journal of Biogeography, 33, pp. 1712-1728; http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/bd-maps/, Bd-Maps (2010).
