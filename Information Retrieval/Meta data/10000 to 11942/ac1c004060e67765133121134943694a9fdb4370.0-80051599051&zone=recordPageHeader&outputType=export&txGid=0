These extremes can be affected by potential future environmental change, including global climate change and land cover change. In this paper, the relative impact of both climate change and urban expansion on the peak flows and flood extent is investigated for a small-scale suburban catchment in Belgium. A rainfall-runoff model was coupled to a hydrodynamic model in order to simulate the present-day and future river streamflow. The coupled model was calibrated based on a series of measured water depths and, after model validation, fed with different climate change and urban expansion scenarios in order to evaluate the relative impact of both driving factors on the peak flows and flood extent. The three climate change scenarios that were used (dry, wet winter, wet summer) were based on a statistical downscaling of 58 different RCM and GCM scenario runs. The urban expansion scenarios were based on three different urban growth rates (low, medium, high urban expansion) that were set up by means of an extrapolation of the observed trend of urban expansion. The results suggest that possible future climate change is the main source of uncertainty affecting changes in peak flow and flood extent. The urban expansion scenarios show a more consistent trend. The potential damage related to a flood is, however, mainly influenced by land cover changes that occur in the floodplain. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Belgium; Climate change; Floods; Peak flows; Urban expansion","Belgium; Climate change scenarios; Coupled models; Driving factors; Environmental change; Flood plains; Global climate changes; Human lives; Hydrodynamic model; Hydrological extremes; Land-cover change; Model validation; Peak flows; Possible futures; Rainfall-runoff models; Relative impact; Statistical downscaling; Urban expansion; Urban growth; Water depth; Wet winters; Catchments; Climate models; Expansion; Floods; Landforms; Rain; Runoff; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; flood; hydrodynamics; hydrology; peak flow; rainfall-runoff modeling; streamflow; suburban area; urban development; water depth; Belgium",,,,,,"(2001) Van nature overstroombare gebieden (Naturally flood zones), , Agentschap voor Geografische Informatie Vlaanderen (AGIV) .
