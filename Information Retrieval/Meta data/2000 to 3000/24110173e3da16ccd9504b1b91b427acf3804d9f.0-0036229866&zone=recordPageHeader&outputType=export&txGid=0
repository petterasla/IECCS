Soil surface temperatures in cloches were significantly higher than in lidless control plots or unmanipulated sites. Soil surfaces in cloche plots exceeded 0°C and 8°C (the approximate threshold for growth and development in several invertebrate species) for longer than in control plots. No consistent changes in populations of Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni (Collembola), Stereotydeus mollis (Acari) Nanorchestes antarcticus (Acari) or observed in the cloche plots after 3 growing seasons at higher temperatures. Abundance of S. mollis was strongly related to algal biomass, but abundances of other species were not clearly related to the environmental characteristics of manipulation plots. Although low temperatures may have a role as a limiting factor on a geographical scale, local populations of invertebrates are probably influenced more by the availability of liquid water; and invertebrate responses could be very slow owing to short growing seasons and long life cycles in continental Antarctica.","Acari; Collembola; Field manipulation; Global warming; Thermal ecology","abundance; climate change; global warming; population ecology; soil fauna; soil temperature; Antarctica; Cape Bird; Ross Island; Acari; Acari; algae; Aves; Collembola; Collembola; Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni; Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni; Hypogastruridae; Hypogastruridae; Invertebrata; Nanorchestes antarcticus; Nanorchestidae; Penthalodidae; Stereotydeus mollis",,,,,,"Block, W., Ecological and physiological studies of terrestrial arthropods in the Ross Dependency 1984-85 (1985) British Antarctic Survey Bulletin, 68, pp. 115-122; Block, W., Terrestrial Ecosystems: Antarctica (1994) Polar Biology, 14, pp. 293-300; Broady, P.A., Broadscale patterns in the distribution of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation at three ice-free regions on Ross Island, Antarctica (1989) Hydrobiologia, 172, pp. 77-95; Brown, I., (1993) The influence of low temperature on the Antarctic nematode Panagrolaimus davidi, , PhD thesis, University of Otago, Dunedin; Coulson, S.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Webb, N.R., Block, W., Bale, J.S., Strathdee, A.T., Worland, M.R., Wooley, C., Effects of experimental temperature elevation on high-arctic soil microarthropod populations (1996) Polar Biology, 16, pp. 147-153; Duncan, K.W., A note on the distribution and abundance of the endemic collembolan Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni Carpenter 1908 at Cape Bird, Antarctica (1979) Mauri Ora, 7, pp. 19-24; Fitzsimons, J.M., Temperature and three species of Antarctic arthropods (1971) Pacific Insects Monographs, 25, pp. 127-135; Gressitt, J.L., Introduction (1967) Entomology of Antarctica, pp. 1-33. , Gressitt, J.
