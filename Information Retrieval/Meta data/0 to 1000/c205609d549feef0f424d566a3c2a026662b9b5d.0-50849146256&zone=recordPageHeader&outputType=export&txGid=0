This paper gives: (1) data showing observed changes of urban warming in these cities; (2) discussion concerning the method and the results of estimates on number of days exceeding or not reaching certain values of maximum and minimum temperatures from monthly mean temperatures; and (3) probable changes in these numbers in selected large cities of Japan in connection with predicted global warming due to an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases. © 1990.",,,,,,,,"Omoto, Hamotani, A proposed method of eliminating urban effects from climatological data obtained at stations in big cities (1979) Journal of Agricultural Meteorology, 35, pp. 93-96; Oke, Inadvertent modification of the city atmosphere and the prospects for planned urban climates (1976) Proc.
