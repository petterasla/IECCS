Sightings of Peary caribou were compared from two aerial searches, in 1993 and 1998, on Bathurst and its neighbouring islands, western Queen Elizabeth Islands in the Canadian High Arctic. The comparison indicated a near-total (98%) cataclysmic decline in the number of Peary caribou seen per unit of search effort. In summer 1993, 2400 caribou were counted during 33.8 h of low-level helicopter searches. In contrast, in summer 1998, only 43 caribou were seen within the same area during 35.2 h of low-level helicopter searches. The frequency of observation was markedly different: 118.3 caribou/100 min in 1993, but only 2.0 caribou/100 min in 1998. The number of carcasses indicated that the decline resulted from deaths and not from mass emigration. Males died at a disproportionately higher rate than females among all 1+ yr old caribou, and bulls (4+ yr) compared to cows (3+ yr) had died at an even greater rate. Widespread, prolonged, exceptionally severe snow and ice conditions from 1994-95 to 1996-97 caused the die-off. Trends in snowfall are consistent with predictions for global warming in the western Canadian High Arctic. Future climate change may increase the frequency of years with unfavorable snow and ice conditions, which could prevent or at least impede future recovery of Peary caribou populations on the western Queen Elizabeth Islands, particularly to sizes that would support subsistence harvesting.","Cataclysmic die-off; Peary caribou; Rangifer tarandus pearyi; Western Queen Elizabeth Islands","climate change; endangered species; mortality; population decline; ungulate; Canada; North America; Queen Elizabeth Islands; Rangifer tarandus; Rangifer tarandus pearyi; Ungulata",,,,,,"Appenzeller, C., Schwander, J., Sommer, S., Stocker, T.F., The North Atlantic Oscillation and its imprint on precipitation and ice accumulation in Greenland (1998) Geophysical Research Letters, 25, pp. 1939-1942; Behinke, R.H., Equilibrium and non-equilibrium models of livestock population dynamics in pastoral Africa: Their relevance to Arctic grazing systems (2000) Rangifer Special Issue, 20, pp. 141-152; Bergerud, A.T., Caribou (1978) Big Game of North America: Ecology and Management, pp. 83-101. , Schmidt, J.L., and Gilbert, D.L., eds.
