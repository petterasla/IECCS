Current light water reactors (LWRs) will be replaced by FBRs and FBR cycle will be established in the future considering the limited amount of uranium (U) resource. The introduction of FBRs requires plutonium (Pu) recovered from LWR spent fuel. The authors propose advanced system named ""Flexible Fuel Cycle Initiative (FFCI)"" which can supply enough Pu and hold no surplus Pu, can respond flexibly the future technical and social uncertainties, and can achieve an economical FBR cycle. FFCI can simplify the 2nd LWR reprocessing facility for Japan (after Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant) which only carries out U removal from LWR spent fuel. Residual ""Recycle Material"" is, according to FBRs introduction status, immediately treated in an FBR reprocessing to fabricate FBR fuel or temporarily stored for the utilization in FBRs at necessary timing. FFCI has high flexibility by having several options for future uncertainties by the introduction of Recycle Material as a buffer material between LWR and FBR cycles. ©Atomic Energy Society of Japan.","FBR; Flexible fuel cycle initiative (FFCI); LWR; Plutonium (Pu); Recycle material; Reprocessing; Storage; Transition period; Uranium (U) removal; Utilization","Breeder reactors; Energy storage; Fast reactors; Global warming; Light water reactors; Plutonium; Uranium; Fast breeder reactors (FBR); Recycle materials; Uranium removal; Nuclear fuel reprocessing",,,,,,"Genshiryokuseisakutaikou and Shiryo (2005) Japanese 〈Framework for Nuclear Energy Policy and Data, , Atomic Energy Commission of Japan, 〉, October 11; Noda, H., Inagaki, T., Feasibility study on commercialized FR cycle systems in Japan - The results in the first phase and future plans of the study (2001) GLOBAL 2001, , Paris; Sagayama, Y., Sato, K., Kotake, S., Overall plan and progress situation of the feasibility study on commercialized FR cycle systems (2003) GLOBAL 2003, , New Orleans; Amano, O., Kawamura, F., Sasahira, A., Verification of key technologies for FLUOREX, the New reprocessing system for LWR fuel cycle (2003) GLOBAL 2003, , New Orleans; Y.
