In this study a reference card that uses differences in coral colour was developed as an inexpensive, rapid and non-invasive method for the assessment of bleaching. The card uses a 6 point brightness/saturation scale within four colour hues to record changes in bleaching state. Changes on the scale of 2 units or more reflect a change in symbiont density and chlorophyll a content, and therefore the bleaching state of the coral. When used by non-specialist observers in the field (here on an intertidal reef flat), there was an inter-observer error of ± 1 colour score. This technique improves on existing subjective assessment of bleaching state by visual observation and offers the potential for rapid, wide-area assessment of changing coral condition. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Coral bleaching; Coral colour; Coral condition assessment; Global climate change; Monitoring; Reef condition","chlorophyll a; coral bleaching; coral reef; density; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; global change; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Andréfouët, S., Berkelmans, R., Odriozola, L., Done, T., Oliver, J., Muller-Karger, F., Choosing the appropriate spatial resolution for monitoring coral bleaching events using remote sensing (2002) Coral Reefs, 21, pp. 147-154; Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching: Causes and consequences (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. S129-S138; Brown, B.E., Le Tissier, M.D.A., Dunne, R.P., Tissue retraction in the scleractinian coral Coeloseris mayeri, its effect upon pigmentation, and preliminary implications for heat balance (1994) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 105, pp. 209-218; Coles, S.L., Jokiel, P.L., Effects of temperature on photosynthesis and respiration in hermatypic corals (1977) Mar Biol, 43, pp. 209-216; Dove, S.G., Takabayashi, M., HoeghGuldberg, O., Isolation and partial characterization of the pink and blue pigments of pocilloporid and acroporid corals (1995) Biol Bull, 189, pp. 288-297; Dove, S.G., Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Ranganathan, S., Major colour patterns of reef-building corals are due to a family of GFP-like proteins (2001) Coral Reefs, 19, pp. 197-204; Dustan, P., Chakrabarti, S., Alling, A., Mapping and monitoring the health and vitality of coral reefs from satellite: A biospheric approach (2000) Life Support Biosph Sci, 7, pp. 149-159; Endler, J.A., On the measurement and classification of colour in studies of animal colour patterns (1990) Biol J Linn Soc, 41, pp. 315-352; Fine, M., Steindler, L., Loya, Y., Endolithic algae photoacclimate to increased irradiance during coral bleaching (2004) Mar Freshw Res, 55, pp. 115-121; Fitt, W.K., Brown, B.E., Warner, M.E., Dunne, R.P., Coral bleaching: Interpretation of thermal tolerance limits and thermal thresholds in tropical corals (2001) Coral Reefs, 20, pp. 51-65; Glynn, P.W., D'Croz, L., Experimental-evidence for high-temperature stress as the cause of El-Nino-coincident coral mortality (1990) Coral Reefs, 8, pp. 181-191; Goreau, T.J., Hayes, R.M., Coral bleaching and ocean 'hot spots' (1994) Ambio, 23, pp. 176-180; Hedley, J.D., Mumby, P.J., Biological and remote sensing perspectives of pigmentation in coral reef organisms (2002) Adv Mar Biol, 43, pp. 277-317; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's coral reefs (1999) Mar Freshw Res, 50, pp. 839-866; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Smith, G.J., The effect of sudden changes in temperature, light and salinity on the population-density and export of zooxanthellae from the Reef Corals Stylophora-Pistillata Esper and Seriatopora-Hystrix Dana (1989) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 129, pp. 279-303; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Salvat, B., Periodic mass bleaching of reef corals along the outer reef slope in Moorea, French Polynesia (1995) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 121, pp. 181-190; Iglesias-Prieto, R., Trench, R.K., Acclimation and adaptation to irradiance in symbiotic dinoflagellates.
