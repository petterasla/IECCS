In the southern North Sea, temperatures have increased in the last three decades and this will likely have consequences on the seasonality of marine organisms living in the area. Ctenophores such as Beroe gracilis and Pleurobrachia pileus could be particularly affected by changes in their own phenology and that of their prey, thus causing shifts in ecosystem function. Despite their global relevance and their potentially deleterious effect on the fishing industry, only a few long-term records of ctenophore abundance exist, and most of these records are semiquantitative in nature. Therefore, our knowledge of the influence of environmental factors on their population development is presently very limited. In this study, the long-term abundance dynamics of B. gracilis, P. pileus and their food calanoid copepods were analysed for a highly temporally resolved time series in the German Bight at Helgoland Roads. Special attention was focused on the response of these organisms to climate warming. Bayesian statistics showed that the phenology of the two ctenophores shifted in a step-like mode in the year 1987/1988 to permanent earlier appearances. The seasonal change in the population blooms of P. pileus and B. gracilis correlated remarkably well with a step-like increase in winter and spring sea surface temperatures of the southern North Sea. Possible explanations for the changes observed in these organisms include higher reproductive rates, increased winter survival rates or both. Interannual variations in ctenophore abundances correlated best with the interannual changes in spring temperatures, although the impact of temperature on B. gracilis appeared less pronounced. The changes in copepods abundance were not consistent with changes in P. pileus and B. gracilis. P. pileus showed longer periods of high abundance after the permanent seasonal advancement. These longer periods were correlated with a decline in the average autumn abundance of copepods. Changes in the phenology of these organisms raise the concerns on the declining state of fish stocks, which could potentially be exacerbated by gelatinous zooplankton outbreaks. These conditions may ultimately lead to trophic dead ends by channelling the flow of energy away from higher trophic levels. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bayesian statistics; Beroe gracilis; Copepods; Helgoland Roads; North Sea; Phenology; Pleurobrachia pileus; Regime shift","abundance; Bayesian analysis; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem function; environmental factor; global warming; phenology; population outbreak; sea surface temperature; seasonality; spatial distribution; time series analysis; zooplankton; Atlantic Ocean; Frisian Islands; German Bight; Germany; Helgoland; North Frisian Islands; North Sea; Schleswig-Holstein; Beroe gracilis; Calanoida; Copepoda; Ctenophora (coelenterates); Pleurobrachia pileus",,,,,,"Baker, L.D., Reeve, M.R., Laboratory culture of the Lobate Ctenophore Mnemiopsis mccradyi with notes on feeding and fecundity (1974) Marine Biology, 26, pp. 57-62; Bamstedt, U., Trophodynamics of Pleurobrachia pileus (Ctenophora, Cydippida) and ctenophore summer occurrence of the Norwegian north-west coast (1998) Sarsia, 83, pp. 169-181; Beaugrand, G., The North Sea regime shift: evidence, causes, mechanisms and consequences (2004) Progress in Oceanography, 60, pp. 245-262; Costello, J.H., Sullivan, B.K., Gifford, D.J., A physical-biological interaction underlying variable phenological responses to climate change by coastal zooplankton (2006) Journal of Plankton Research, 28, pp. 1099-1105; Cleland, E.E., Chuine, I., Menzel, A., Mooney, H.A., Schwartz, M.D., Shifting plant phenology in response to global change (2007) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 22, pp. 357-365; Cushing, D.H., Plankton production and year-class strength in fish populations: an update of the match/mismatch hypothesis (1990) Advances in Marine Biology, 26, pp. 1-122; Dose, V., Menzel, A., Bayesian analysis of climate change impacts in phenology (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 259-272; Dose, V., Menzel, A., Bayesian correlation between temperature and blossom onset data (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 1451-1459; Dunn, C.W., Hejnol, A., Matus, D.Q., et al, Broad phylogenomic sampling improves resolution of the animal tree of life (2008) Nature, 452, pp. 745-749; Edwards, M.A., Richardson, A.J., Impact of climate change on marine pelagic phenology and trophic mismatch (2004) Nature, 430, pp. 881-884; Fraser, J.H., The ecology of the ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus in Scottish waters (1970) Journal du Conseil International pour l'Exploration de la Mer, 33, pp. 149-168; Frid, C.L.J., Newton, L.C., Williams, J.A., The feeding rates of Pleurobrachia (Ctenophora) and Sagitta (Chaetognatha), with notes on the potential seasonal role of planktonic predators in the dynamics of North Sea zooplankton communities (1994) The Netherlands Journal of Aquatic Ecology, 28, pp. 181-191; Graham, W.M., Pag'es, F., Hamner, W.M., A physical context for gelatinous zooplankton aggregations: a review (2001) Hydrobiologia, 451, pp. 199-212; Greene, C.H., Landry, M.R., Monger, B.C., Foraging bahavior and prey selection by the ambush entangling predator Pleurobrachia bachei (1986) Ecology, 67, pp. 1493-1501; Greve, W., Ökologische Untersuchungen an Pleurobrachia pileus, 2.
