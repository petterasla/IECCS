The present understanding of the carbon cycle is inadequate to the purpose of assessing the relationship between future anthropogenic emissions and concentrations of atmospheric CO2. The most important problem is that natural science cannot presently explain the relationship between present and past anthropogenetic emissions and concentrations. Sinks for CO2 are inadequate to explain present and past dispositions of emissions. This deficiency in scientific understanding leads to uncertainty in the analysis of potential future emissions and atmospheric CO2 accumulation, and to uncertainty in the specification of other policy analysis instruments such as global warming potential coefficients. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"Anthropogenic Emissions; Carbon Cycle; Air Pollution - Analysis; Carbon Dioxide - Concentration; Carbon Dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon oxygen monocycle; air pollution; atmosphere; climate; conference paper; health care policy; nonhuman",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Boden, T.A., Kanciruk, P., Farrell, M.P, (1990) Trends ’90: A Compendium of Data on Global Change, , ORNL/CDIAC-36, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN; Bolin, B., How Much CO<inf>2</inf> Will Remain in the Atmosphere?
