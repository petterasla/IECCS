Simulation models allowing to compute integrate seasonal values of basic components of cabron balance in the most characteristic plant communities of typical tundra were built. To access the landscape pattern of tundra carbon balance we applied GIS-approach based on the original computer map of ecosystem borders. In 1994 the seasonal (from the beginning of snow melting till the end of total soil freezing) carbon balance of typical tundra landscape was estimated as -4 g C · m-2 · year-1 (carbon sink), the ecosystem total respiration as +145 g C · m-2 · year-1, and gross primary production as -149 g C · m-2 · year-1. Such a poorly expressed carbon sink conceptually should be considered as landscape equilibrium. Nevertheless the subsequent computer simulation of climate changes confirmed the hypothesis of positive feedback between global warming and change of carbon balance pattern in tundra ecosystems from sink to source. From the other side we found that regional peculiarities of ecological and climatic conditions can strongly effect the climate global change appearance.",,,,,,,,"Russian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceRussian sourceBillings, W.D., Carbon balance of Alaskan tundra and taiga ecosystems: Past, present and future (1987) Quart.
