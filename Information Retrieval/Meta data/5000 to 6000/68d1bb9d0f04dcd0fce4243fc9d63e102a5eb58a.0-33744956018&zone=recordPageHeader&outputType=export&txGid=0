By using the hedonic price approach, the marginal willingness to pay for small changes in climate variables is derived. Various indices of temperature and precipitation are used including means, ranges, extremes and January and July averages. We specify one hedonic regression including information on house prices and wage data for 755 Posttowns and found the model containing January and July averages of temperature and precipitation most appropriate. The estimates suggest that British people would typically prefer higher temperatures in January. Increased precipitation in January is likely to reduce welfare. Changes in temperature and precipitation in July are not significant. Limited global warming, with a more pronounced effect of temperature increases compared to higher precipitation levels during winter months, might thus benefit British households. © Springer 2006.",,"Global warming; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Regression analysis; Amenity value; Climate variables; Hedonic regression; Wage data; Climate change; climate change; global warming; hedonic analysis; household expenditure; index method; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; winter; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,"Bastian, C.T., McLeod, D.M., Germino, M.J., Reiners, W.A., Blasko, B.J., Environmental amenities and agricultural land values: A hedonic model using geographic information systems data (2002) Ecol.
