Annually, 8.5-14.3 Mt rice straw burning contributes 5.0-8.6 MtCO2-eq which could be converted to 786-1325 MW of power, yielding a total greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of 7.8-13.2 MtCO2-eq. Moreover, 1090-1837 Mm3 of natural gas could be substituted annually. A total of 25 provinces in central Thailand have potential to generate electricity with a total capacity of 210-292 MW (plant efficiency 20-27%), resulting in an annual GHG emission savings of 2.3-2.6 MtCO2-eq, and with a provincial capacity of over 20 MW in 6 provinces, 10-20 MW in 7 provinces, 1-10 MW in 6 provinces and less than 1 MW in 6 provinces. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
