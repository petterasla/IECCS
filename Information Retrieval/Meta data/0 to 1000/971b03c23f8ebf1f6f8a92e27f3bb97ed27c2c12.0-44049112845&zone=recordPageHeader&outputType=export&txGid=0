The pressure on developing countries for increased energy consumption makes reduction of fossil fuel use in the industrialized countries all the more important. Nuclear power already has had a significant impact. Primarily through its use. France reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 24% from 1973 to 1986. Given a vigorous program of nuclear power development, electrification, and conservation, one can envisage a U.S. energy economy in which CO2 production is halved. Standardized reactors, of small or medium size, may enhance the prospects for a nuclear renaissance in industrialized countries, and may be well matched to the needs of developing countries. © 1992.",,,,,,,,"Gammon, Sundquist, Fraser, History of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (1985) Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and the Global Carbon Cycle, pp. 25-62. , J.R.
