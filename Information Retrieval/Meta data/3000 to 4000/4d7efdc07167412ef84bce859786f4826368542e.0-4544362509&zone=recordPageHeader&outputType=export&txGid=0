Extensive sampling protocol was performed along the submerging upland tidal marsh soils to model C sequestration. Coastal marsh soils are accreting vertically and migrating laterally over the low-lying forest soils to keep pace with sea-level rise. The predictive C sequestration model was a two-step linear function. Therefore, C sequestration will continue to occur by accumulation in the organic horizons and sea-level rise is the driving force. During the last 150 yr, the rate of C sequestration averaged 83.5 ± 23 g m-2 yr-1. Before the last few hundred years, the predicted long-term rate of C sequestration averaged 29.2 ± 5.35 g m-2 yr-1. Sampling protocol and model validation ascertain the validity of the model and placed 80% confidence and 10% accuracy on rates of C sequestration and the predictive model. The model indicated that coastal marsh soils have higher C storage capacity than upland forest soils, and soils in the Cumulic subgroup of Mollisols. In general, C storage in mineral soils tends to reach a steady-state condition, whereas C sequestration in coastal marsh soils is a continuous phenomenon. During the next century, future C sequestration in the newly formed coastal marsh soils averaged 400 ± 162 g m-2 yr-1. Modeling C sequestration in coastal marsh ecosystems indicated that C storage under positive accretionary balance acts as a negative feedback mechanism to global warming.",,"Carbon; Coastal zones; Ecosystems; Global warming; Sea level; Carbon sequestration; Coastal marsh soils; Soils; biogeochemical cycle; carbon sequestration; coastal zone; marsh; organic carbon; Dorchester County [Maryland]; Maryland; North America; United States",,,,,,"Amador, J.A., Jones, R.D., Response of carbon mineralization to combined changes in soil moisture and carbon-phosphorus ratio in a low phosphorus histosols (1997) Soil Sci., 162, pp. 275-282; Beare, M.H., Cabrera, M.L., Hendrix, P.F., Coleman, D.C., Aggregate-protected and unprotected organic matter pools in conventional and no-tillage soils (1994) Soil Sci.
