It is unclear what impacts global warming will have on tallgrass species. In the present study, we examined leaf net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and leaf respiration rate in darkness (Rd) of Aster ericoides (L.) Nesom, Ambrosia psilostachya DC., Helianthus mollis Lam., and Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash in response to experimental warming in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem of the Great Plains, USA, in the autumn (fall) of 2000 and through 2001. Warming has been implemented with infrared heaters since 21 November 1999. The Pn increased significantly in spring, decreased in early fall, and did not change in summer and late fall in the four species under warming compared with control. The Rd of the four species increased significantly until mid-summer and then did not change under warming. Measured temperature-response curves of Pn showed that warming increased the optimum temperature of Pn (Topt) by 2.32 and 4.59 °C for H. mollis and S. nutans, respectively, in August, whereas there were no changes in May and September, and A. ericoides and A. psilostachya also showed no changes in any of the 3 months. However, Pn at optimum temperature (Popt) showed downregulation in September and no regulation in May and August for all four species. The temperature-response curves of Rd illustrate that the temperature sensitivity of Rd, Q10, was lower in the warmed plots compared with the control plots, except for A. ericoides in August, whereas there were no changes in May and September for all four species. The results of the present study indicate that photosynthetic and respiratory acclimation varies with species and among seasons, occurring in the mid-growing season and not in the early and late growing seasons. © 2007 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Acclimation; Ambrosia psilostachya; Climatic warming; Photosynthesis; Respiration; Sorghastrum nutans; Tallgrass prairie; Temperature","acclimation; environmental effect; global warming; grass; growing season; respiration; temperature effect; Great Plains; North America; Ambrosia; Ambrosia psilostachya; Helianthus; Helianthus mollis; Sorghastrum nutans; Symphyotrichum ericoides ericoides",,,,,,"Aber, J.D., Federer, C.A., A generalized, lumped parameter model of photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and net primary production in temperate and boreal forest ecosystem (1992) Oecologia, 92, pp. 463-474; An, Y., Wan, S., Zhou, X., Subeda, A.A., Wallace, L.L., Luo, Y., Plant nitrogen concentration, use efficiency, and contents in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem under experimental warming (2005) Global Change Biol., 11, pp. 1733-1744; Anderson, J., McCollum, G., Roberts, W., High temperature acclimation in pepper leaves (1990) HortScience, 25, pp. 1272-1274; Arnone, J.A., Körner, C., Temperature adaptation and acclimation potential of leaf dark respiration in two species of Ranunculus from warm and cold habitats (1997) Arctic Alpine Res., 29, pp. 122-125; Atkin, O.K., Evans, J.R., Ball, M.C., Lambers, H., Pons, T.L., Leaf respiration of snow gum in the light and dark: Interactions between temperature and irradiance (2000) Plant Physiol., 122, pp. 915-923; Atkin, O.K., Holly, C., Ball, M.C., Acclimation of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) leaf respiration to seasonal and diurnal variations in temperature: The importance of changes in the capacity and temperature sensitivity of respiration (2000) Plant Cell Environ., 23, pp. 15-26; Atkin, O.K., Edwards, E.J., Loveys, B.R., Response of root respiration to changes in temperature and its relevance to global warming (2000) New Phytol., 147, pp. 141-154; Atkin, O.K., Bruhn, D., Hurry, V.M., Tjoelker, M.G., The hot and the cold: Unraveling the variable response of plant respiration to temperature (2005) Funct.
