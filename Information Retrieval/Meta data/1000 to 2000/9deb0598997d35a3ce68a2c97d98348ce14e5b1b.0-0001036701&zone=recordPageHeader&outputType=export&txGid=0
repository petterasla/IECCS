The data obtained were compared with long-term climatic changes in this region. It was shown that the fire frequency varied considerably in the history of the most flammable types of pine forests. Long-term variation in fire frequency negatively correlated with that in radial increment. Climatic changes favorable for pine growth also resulted in a decreased frequency of fires. The results of analysis suggest that fire frequency during global warming will be mainly determined by regional conditions (predominantly by moisture rather than temperature). © 1997 MAHK Hayka/Interperiodica Publishing.",,,,,,,,"Baisan, C.H., Swetnam, T.W., Fire History on a Desert Mountain Range: Rincon Mountain Wilderness, Arizona, USA (1990) Can.
