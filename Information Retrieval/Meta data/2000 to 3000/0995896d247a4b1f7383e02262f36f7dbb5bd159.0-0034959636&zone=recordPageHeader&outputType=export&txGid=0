Under cost-benefit analysis, relatively modest steps towards greenhouse gas emissions abatement are justified as economically efficient. Under classical utilitarianism and the precautionary principle, in contrast, aggressive steps towards climate stabilization emerge as socially optimal. The paper reviews the value judgements that support each of these normative approaches, arguing that the precautionary principle is most closely tied to the goals and objectives of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.","Classical utilitarianism; Climate change; Cost-benefit analysis; Intergenerational fairness; Precautionary principle","Air pollution control; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Gaseous effluents; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Optimization; Climate stabilization; Climate change",,,,,,"Arrow, K.J., Hurwicz, L., An optimality criterion for decision-making under ignorance (1972) Uncertainty and Expectations in Economics, , Carter, C.F. and Ford, J.L.
