Applications include new markets for crops and reduction of wastes by using field residues or ""wastelands"" as feedstocks in biomass energy production. In addition, engineered crops could synthesize complex compounds. However, conversion to widespread use of biomass could have undesirable impacts. For example, changes in cropping practices may reduce wildlife populations or disrupt food chains. Other negative impacts of an environmentally insensitive development might include increased release of CO2 (worsening global warming), and production of wastes, either water, chemical or biological, that present disposal problems. Biotechnology applied to biomass and chemical production has the potential for aiding economic development while greatly improving environmental quality. Environmental concerns are expressed in this paper, in the belief that consideration of potential problems at the inception of a technology increases the likelihood that environmentally sound courses will be pursued. © 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,,,,,,,,"Beyea, J.; Columbia University, New York, NY, 10022, United States",,,"Informa Healthcare",,,,,07388551,,CRBTE,,"English","Crit.
