Attaining depths over 1.6 km, Lake Baikal is the deepest and most voluminous of the world's great lakes. Increases in average water temperature (1.21°C since 1946), chlorophyll a (300% since 1979), and an influential group of zooplankton grazers (335% increase in cladocerans since 1946) may have important implications for nutrient cycling and food web dynamics. Results from multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modeling suggest that cladocerans increased strongly in response to temperature but not to algal biomass, and cladocerans depressed some algal resources without observable fertilization effects. Changes in Lake Baikal are particularly significant as an integrated signal of long-term regional warming, because this lake is expected to be among those most resistant to climate change due to its tremendous volume. These findings highlight the importance of accessible, long-term monitoring data for understanding ecosystem response to large-scale stressors such as climate change. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Daphnia; Global warming; Great lakes; High-latitude; Long-termecological research; Plankton; Russia; Subarctic; Time series; Trophic structure","chlorophyll a; ecosystem response; environmental change; food web; global warming; lake water; modeling; multivariate analysis; nutrient cycling; regression analysis; water temperature; zooplankton; Eurasia; Lake Baikal; Russian Federation; Siberia; algae; Daphnia",,,,,,"Afanasyeva, E.L., Shimaraev, M.N., Long-term zooplankton variations in the pelagial of Lake Baikal under global warming (2006) Aquatic Ecology at the Dawn of the XXI Century, pp. 253-265. , In: (eds Alimova AF, Bul'ona VV), KMK Scientific Press Ltd, Moscow, Russia; Armstrong, R., (2001), http://nsidc.org/data/g01092.html, National Snow and Ice Data Center, Boulder, COCarlson, R.E., Trophic state index for lakes (1977) Limnology and Oceanography, 22, pp. 361-369; Carpenter, S.R., Cole, J.J., Hodgson, J.R., Trophic cascades, nutrients, and lake productivity: Whole-lake experiments (2001) Ecological Monographs, 71, pp. 163-186; Coats, R., Perez-Losada, J., Schladow, G., Richards, R., Goldman, C., The warming of lake Tahoe (2006) Climatic Change, 76, pp. 121-148; Edmondson, W.T., Secchi disk and chlorophyll (1980) Limnology and Oceanography, 25, pp. 378-379; Elser, J.J., Urabe, J., The stoichiometry of consumer-driven nutrient recycling: Theory, observations, and consequences (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 735-751; Fietz, S., Kobanova, G., Izmest'eva, L., Nicklisch, A., Regional, vertical and seasonal distribution of phytoplankton and photosynthetic pigments in Lake Baikal (2005) Journal of Plankton Research, 27, pp. 793-810; Gillooly, J.F., Dodson, S.I., Latitudinal patterns in the size distribution and seasonal dynamics of new world, freshwater cladocerans (2000) Limnology and Oceanography, 45, pp. 22-30; Hampton, S.E., Schindler, D.E., Empirical evaluation of observation scale effects in community time series (2006) Oikos, 113, pp. 424-439; Hampton, S.E., Scheuerell, M.D., Schindler, D.E., Coalescence in the lake Washington story: Interaction strengths in a planktonic food web (2006) Limnology and Oceanography, 51, pp. 2042-2051; Hays, G.C., Richardson, A.J., Robinson, C., Climate change and marine plankton (2005) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 20, pp. 337-344; Heim, B., Klump, J., Oberhänsli, H., Fagel, N., Assembly and concept of a web-based GIS within the paleolimnological project CONTINENT (Lake Baikal, Russia) (2008) Journal of Paleolimnology, 39, pp. 567-584; Heim, B., Oberhaensli, H., Fietz, S., Kaufmann, H., Variation in Lake Baikal's phytoplankton distribution and fluvial input assessed by SeaWiFS satellite data (2005) Global and Planetary Change, 46, p. 9; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
