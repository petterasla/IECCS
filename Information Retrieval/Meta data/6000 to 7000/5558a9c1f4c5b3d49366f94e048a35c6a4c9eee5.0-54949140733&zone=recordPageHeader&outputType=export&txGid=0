The use of pure CF3I in gas insulated switchgear (GIS) and gas circuit breakers (GCB) is difficult because liquid CF3I has a high boiling point. We have therefore mixed CF3I with CO2 or N 2. By investigating the decomposed gas after a current interruption, we have shown that the iodine density from CF3I-CO 2(30%-70%) is about 1/3 of that of pure CF3I. In addition, no fluorine was detected from the gas mixture. Our investigation of the breakdown voltage characteristics has shown that the dielectric strength of CF3I-CO2(30%-70%) is about 0.75 to 0.80 times that of SF6. In Breaker Terminal Fault (BTF) and Short Line Fault (SLF) interruption, CF3I-CO2 is superior to CF 3I-N2. Because of the high boiling point of CF 3I, the proportion of CF3I should be small. In BTF interruption, the performance approximates to that of pure CF3I when the proportion of CF3I exceeds 30%. Similarly, the SLF interruption performance approximates to that of pure CF3I when the proportion of CF3I exceeds 20%. © 2008 IEEE.","Breaker Terminal Fault (BTF); CF3I; Substitute gas for SF 6","Boiling point; Electric circuit breakers; Electric conductivity; Fluorine; Global warming; Iodine; Ionization of gases; Port terminals; Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breakers; Breakdown voltages; Breaker Terminal Fault (BTF); CF<sub>3</sub>I; Current interruptions; Decomposed gasses; Dielectric strengths; Gas circuit breakers; Gas insulated switchgears; Global Warming potentials; Interruption performances; Line faults; Substitute gas for SF <sub>6</sub>; Gases",,,,,,"New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) Report: Feasibility Study on Application of SF6 Alternative Gas (CF3I) to the Market of Electric Equipment for PowerTransmission, Transformation and Substation System (FY2004) final Report, 2005 (in Japanese)Spatz, M.W., Update on Low GWP Refrigerant: Fluid H (2007) Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Alternative Refrigerant Systems Symposium, pp. 1-51. , Phoenix, Arizona, USA, pp; Duan, Y.-Y., Zhu, M.-S., Han, L.-Z., Experimental vapor pressure data and a vapor pressure equation for Trifluoroiodomcthanc (CF 3I) (1996) Fluid Phase Equilibria, 121, pp. 227-234; Mackawa, D., Taki, M., Katagiri, H., Komatsuzaki, T., Yanabu, S., The interruption and insulation characteristics by CF3I-CO2 mixture gas as candidate of substitute for SF6 (2007) The Annual Meeting Record I.E.E Japan, switchgcar and lightning arrester, substitute for SF6; Taki, M., Maekawa, D., Odaka, H., Mizoguchi, H., Yanabu, S., Interruption Capability of CF3I Gas as a Substitution Candidate for SF6 Gas (2007) IEEE Trans.
