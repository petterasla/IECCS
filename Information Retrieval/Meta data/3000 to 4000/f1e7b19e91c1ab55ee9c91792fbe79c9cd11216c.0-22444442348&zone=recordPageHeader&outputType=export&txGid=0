How sensitive are the answers to these questions when we move from exogenous to endogenous technical change? To investigate these issues we modify the ETC-RICE model described in Buonanno et al. (2001) by embedding in it a hazard rate function as in Bosello and Moretto (1999). With this model at hand we run numerical optimisations focusing our attention on the control variables of the representative agents, i.e., domestic abatement rate, investments in physical capital, and R&amp;D spending, as well as on the endogenous patterns of GDP level and CO2 emissions. Our results show that uncertainty strongly influences agents behaviour; in particular, agents slow down their emissions in order to maintain a more sustainable growth path. In addition, R&amp;D expenditures trigger the ""engine of growth"" exclusively when environmental technical change is formalized in an endogenous fashion. However, even if environmental uncertainty may stimulate technical change, long-run growth it turns out to be negatively affected by the former, as also predicted by Clarke and Reed (1994) Tsur and Zemel (1996) and Bosello and Moretto (1999). © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Climate change; Endogenous technical change; Uncertainty",,,,,,,"Buonanno, P., Carraro, C., Castelnuovo, E., Galeotti, M., Emission trading restrictions with endogenous technological change (2001) International Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics, 3, pp. 379-395; Bosello, F., Moretto, M., Dynamic uncertainty and global warming risk (1999) FEEM Working Paper, N. 80.99; Clarke, H.R., Reed, W.J., Consumption/pollution trade-offs in an environment vulnerable to pollution-related catastrophic collapse (1994) Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 18, pp. 991-1010; Tsur, Y., Zemel, A., Accounting for global warming risks: Resource management under event uncertainty (1996) Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 20, pp. 1289-1305; Pindyck, R.S., Irreversibilities and the timing of environmental policy (2000) Resource and Energy Economics, 22, pp. 233-259; Climate Change 1995, Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change (1996) Contribution of Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Climate Change 1995, Impacts, Adoptions and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientific-Technical Analyses (1996) Contribution of Working Group II to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Climate Change 1995, the Science of Climate Change (1996) Contribution of Working Group I to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Fisher, A.C., Introduction to the special issue on irreversibility (2000) Resource and Energy Economics, 22, pp. 189-196; Kerr, R.A., West Antarctica's weak underbelly giving way?
