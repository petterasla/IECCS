The present investigation was done to assess the effects of elevated O3 (70 and 100ppb) on electron transport, carbon fixation, stomatal conductance and pigment concentrations in two tropical soybean (Glycine max L.) varieties, PK 472 and Bragg. Plants were exposed to O3 for 4h·day-1 from 10:00 to 14:00 from germination to maturity. Photosynthesis of both varieties were adversely affected, but the reduction was higher in PK 472 than Bragg. A comparison of chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics with carbon fixation suggested greater sensitivity of dark reactions than light reactions of photosynthesis to O3 stress. The O3-induced uncoupling between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in PK 472 suggests the reduction in photosynthesis may be attributed to a factor other than reduced stomatal conductance. An increase in internal CO2 concentration in both O3-treated soybean varieties compared suggests that the reduction in photosynthesis was due to damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, leading to accumulation of internal CO2 and stomatal closure. The adverse impact of O3 stress increased at higher O3 concentrations in both soybean varieties leading to large reductions in photosynthesis. This study suggests that O3-induced reductions in photosynthesis in tropical and temperate varieties are similar. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Carbon fixation; Global climate; Glycine max; Sensitivity; Tropospheric ozone","ozone; article; greenhouse effect; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant stoma; soybean; Global Warming; Ozone; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Stomata; Soybeans",,"ozone, 10028-15-6; Ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Adir, N., Zer, H., Shochat, I., Photoinhibition - a historic perspective (2003) Photosynthetic Research, 76, pp. 343-370; Agrawal, M., Singh, B., Rajput, M., Marshall, F., Bell, J.N.B., Effect of air pollution on peri-urban agriculture: a case study (2003) Environmental Pollution, 126, pp. 323-329; Ashmore, M.R., Assessing the future impacts of ozone on vegetation (2005) Plant Cell Environment, 28, pp. 949-964; Biswas, D.K., Xu, H., Li, Y.G., Sun, J.Z., Wang, X.Z., Han, X.G., Jiang, G.M., Genotypic differences in leaf biochemical, physiological and growth responses to ozone in 20 winter wheat cultivars released over the past 60years (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 46-59; Calatayud, A., Ramirez, J.W., Iglesias, D.J., Barreno, E., Effects of ozone on photosynthetic CO2 exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence and antioxidant systems in lettuce leaves (2002) Physiologia Plantarum, 116, pp. 308-316; Calatayud, A., Iglesias, D.I., Talon, M., Barreno, E., Effects of 2-month exposure in spinach leaves on photosynthesis, antioxidant systems and lipid peroxidation (2003) Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 41, pp. 839-845; Castagna, A., Nali, C., Ciompi, G., Lorenzini, G., Soldatini, G.F., Ranieri, A., O3 exposure effects photosynthesis of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) plants (2001) New Phytologist, 152, pp. 223-229; Christ, M.M., Ainsworth, E.A., Nelson, R., Schurr, U., Walter, A., Anticipated yield loss in field grown soybean under elevated ozone can be avoided at the expense of leaf growth during early reproductive growth stages in favourable environmental conditions (2006) Journal of Experimental Botany, 57, pp. 2267-2275; Clark, C.S., Weber, J.A., Lee, E.H., Hogsett, W.E., Reductions in gas exchange of Populus tremuloides caused by leaf aging and ozone exposure (1996) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 26, pp. 1384-1391; Degl'Innocenti, E., Guidi, L., Soldatini, G.F., Characterization of the photosynthetic response of tobacco leaves to ozone: CO2 assimilation and chlorophyll fluorescence (2002) Journal of Plant Physiology, 159, pp. 845-853; Duxbury, A.C., Yentsch, C.S., Plankton pigment monographs (1956) Journal of Marine Research, 15, pp. 91-101; Emberson, L.D., Bü ker, P., Ashmore, M.R., Mills, G., Jackson, L.S., Agrawal, M., Atikuzzaman, M.D., Wahid, A., A comparison of North American and Asian exposure-response data for ozone effects on crop yields (2009) Atmospheric Environment, 43, pp. 1945-1953; Feng, Z., Kobayashi, K., Assessing the impacts of current and future concentrations of surface ozone on crop yield with meta analysis (2009) Atmospheric Environment, 43, pp. 1510-1519; Flagler, R.B., Lock, J.E., Elsik, C.G., Leaf level and whole plant gas exchange characteristics of shortleaf pine exposed to ozone and simulated acid rain (1994) Tree Physiology, 14, pp. 361-374; Godde, D., Buchhold, J., Effect of long term fumigation with ozone on the turnover of the D-1 reaction centre polypeptide of photosystem II in spruce (Picea abies) (1992) Physiologia Plantarum, 86, pp. 568-574; Guidi, L., Degl'Innocenti, E., Ozone effects on high light induced photoinhibition in Phaseolus vulgaris (2008) Plant Science, 174, pp. 590-596; Guidi, L., Nali, C., Lorenzini, G., Filppi, F., Soladatini, G.F., Effect of chronic ozone fumigation on the photosynthetic process of poplar clones showing different sensitivity (2001) Environmental Pollution, 113, pp. 245-254; Heath, R.L., Modification of the biochemical pathways of plants induced by ozone: what are the varied routes to change?
