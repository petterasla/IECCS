Here, we reconstructed a 1,910-y-long time series of outbreaks of Oriental migratory locusts (Locusta migratoria manilensis) in China, on the basis of information extracted from >8,000 historical documents. First by analyzing the most recent period with the best data quality using generalized additive models, we found statistically significant associations between the reconstructed locust abundance and indexes of precipitation and temperature at both annual (A.D. 1512-1911) and decadal (A.D. 1000-1900) scales: There were more locusts under dry and cold conditions and when locust abundance was high in the preceding year or decade. Second, by exploring locust-environment correlations using a 200-y moving window, we tested whether these associations also hold further back in time. The locust-precipitation correlation was found to hold at least as far back as to A.D. 500, supporting the robustness of this link as well as the quality of both reconstructions. The locust-temperature correlation was weaker and less consistent, which may reflect this link being indirect and thus more easily moderated by other factors. We anticipate that further analysis of this unique time series now available to the scientific community will continue to provide insights into biological consequences of climate change in the years to come.",,"article; China; climate change; environmental factor; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; locust; nonhuman; priority journal; Animals; China; Climate Change; Grasshoppers; Periodicity; Time Factors; Locusta migratoria manilensis; Orthoptera",,,,,,"Guo, F., Chen, Y., Lu, B., (1991) The Biology of the Migratory Locusts in China, , (Shandong Science and Technology Press, Jinan, China) Chinese; Fan, Y., Locust in yin dynasty (1983) Agric Archaeol, 4, pp. 314-317; Chen, M., Jiang, T., (1728) Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times, , (Ying wu dian, Beijing) Chinese; Chen, J., Outbreaks of locust recorded in Chinese literatures (1936) Annu Zhejiang Entomol Bureau, 5, pp. 188-241; Chen, G., (1939) China Successive Natural and Manmade Disasters Table, , (Jinan University Book Series, Guangzhou, China) Chinese; Ma, S., The population dynamics of the oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria manilensis) in China (1958) Acta Entomol Sin, 8, pp. 1-40; Ma, S., Ding, Y., Li, D., Study on long-term prediction of locust population fluctuations (1965) Acta Entomol Sin, 14, pp. 319-338; Stige, L.C., Chan, K.-S., Zhang, Z., Frank, D., Stenseth, N.C., Thousand-year-long Chinese time series reveals climatic forcing of decadal locust dynamics (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104 (41), pp. 16188-16193. , http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/104/41/16188, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0706813104; Zhang, Z., Periodic temperature-associated drought/flood drives locust plagues in China (2009) Proc R Soc Lond Ser B Biol Sci, 276, pp. 823-831; Yu, G., Shen, H., Liu, J., Impacts of climate change on historical locust outbreaks in China (2009) J Geophys Res Atmos, 114 (D18), pp. D18104; Zhang, D., (2004) A Compendium of Chinese Meteorological Records of the Last 3000 Years, , (Jiangsu Education Publishing House, Nanjing, China) Chinese; (1981) Yearly Charts of Dryness-Wetness in China for the Last 500-Year Period, , Central Meteorological Bureau (Cartographic Publishing House, Beijing) (Chinese); Zheng, J.Y., Wang, W.C., Ge, Q.S., Man, Z.M., Zhang, P.Y., Precipitation variability and extreme events in eastern China during the past 1500 years (2006) Terr Atmos Ocean Sci, 17, pp. 579-592; Tan, M., Cyclic rapid warming on centennial-scale revealed by a 2650-year stalagmite record of warm season temperature (2003) Geophys Res Lett, 30, p. 1617; Wang, S., Wen, X., Luo, Y., Dong, W., Zhao, Z., Yang, B., Reconstruction of temperature series of China for the last 1000 years (2007) Chinese Science Bulletin, 52 (23), pp. 3272-3280. , DOI 10.1007/s11434-007-0425-4; Yang, B., Braeuning, A., Johnson, K., Shi, Y., General characteristics of temperature variation in China during the last two millennia (2002) Geophys Res Lett, 29, p. 1324. , 10.1029/2001GL014485; Moberg, A., Sonechkin, D.M., Holmgren, K., Datsenko, M.H., Karlen, W., Highly variable Northern Hemisphere temperatures reconstructed from low- and high-resolution proxy data (2005) Nature, 433 (7026), pp. 613-617. , DOI 10.1038/nature03265; Ljungqvist, F.C., A new reconstruction of temperature variability in the extratropical northern hemisphere during the last two millennia (2010) Geogr Ann A, 92 A, pp. 339-351; Todd, M.C., Washington, R., Cheke, R.A., Kniveton, D., Brown locust outbreaks and climate variability in southern Africa (2002) Journal of Applied Ecology, 39 (1), pp. 31-42. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00691.x; Cheke, R.A., Holt, J., Complex dynamics of desert locust plagues (1993) Ecological Entomology, 18 (2), pp. 109-115; Uichanco, L.B., Secular trends of locust outbreaks in the Philippines and their apparent relation with sunspot cycle (1936) Philipp J Agric, 25, pp. 321-354; Stenseth, N.Chr., Mysterud, A., Ottersen, G., Hurrell, J.W., Chan, K.-S., Lima, M., Ecological effects of climate fluctuations (2002) Science, 297 (5585), pp. 1292-1296. , DOI 10.1126/science.1071281; Esper, J., Buntgen, U., Frank, D.C., Nievergelt, D., Liebhold, A., 1200 Years of regular outbreaks in alpine insects (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 274 (1610), pp. 671-679. , DOI 10.1098/rspb.2006.0191; Kausrud, K.L., Linking climate change to lemming cycles (2008) Nature, 456, pp. 93-97; Ueda, H., Iwai, A., Kuwako, K., Hori, M., Impact of anthropogenic forcing on the Asian summer monsoon as simulated by eight GCMs (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L06703; Jiang, T., Zhang, Q., Blender, R., Fraedrich, K., Yangtze Delta floods and droughts of the last millennium: Abrupt changes and long term memory (2005) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 82 (3-4), pp. 131-141. , DOI 10.1007/s00704-005-0125-4; Cheke, R.A., Ecology.
