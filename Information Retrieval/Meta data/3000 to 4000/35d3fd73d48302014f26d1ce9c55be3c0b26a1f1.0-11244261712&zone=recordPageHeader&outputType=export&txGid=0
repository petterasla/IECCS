Trees, grown inside three large bays with atmospheres containing 430, 800, or 1200 μmol mol-1 CO 2 at the Biosphere 2 facility, were subjected to a period of drought during which VPD was manipulated, switching between low VPD (approximately 1 kPa) and high VPD (approximately 3 kPa) for several days. When trees were not water-stressed, elevated [CO2] inhibited isoprene emission and stimulated photosynthesis. Isoprene emission was less responsive to drought than photosynthesis. As water-stress increased, the inhibition of isoprene emission disappeared, probably as a result of stomatal closure and the resulting decreases in intercellular [CO2] (Ci). This assumption was supported by increased isoprene emission under high VPD. Drought and high VPD dramatically increased the proportion of assimilated carbon lost as isoprene. When measured at the same [CO2], leaves from trees grown at ambient [CO2] always had higher isoprene emission rates than the leaves of trees grown at elevated [CO2], demonstrating that CO2 inhibition is a long-term effect.","Biosphere 2 Laboratory;
