We used a comparative data set encompassing 330 parasite species reported from 119 primate hosts to examine latitudinal gradients in the diversity of micro and macroparasites per primate host species. Analyses conducted with and without controlling for host phylogeny showed that parasite species richness increased closer to the equator for protozoan parasites, but not for viruses or helminths. Relative to other major parasite groups, protozoa reported from wild primates were transmitted disproportionately by arthropod vectors. Within the protozoa, our results revealed that vector-borne parasites showed a highly significant latitudinal gradient in species richness. This higher diversity of vector-borne protozoa near the tropics could be influenced by a greater abundance or diversity of biting arthropods in the tropics, or by climatic effects on vector behaviour and parasite development. Many vector-borne diseases, such as leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and malaria pose risks to both humans and wildlife, and nearly one-third of the protozoan parasites from free-living primates in our data set have been reported to infect humans. Because the geographical distribution and prevalence of many vector-borne parasites are expected to increase because of global warming, these results are important for predicting future parasite-mediated threats to biodiversity and human health. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity; Latitudinal gradient; Parasite richness; Primates","latitudinal gradient; parasite; primate; species richness; Arthropoda; Primates; Protozoa; Vermes",,,,,,"Ashford, R.W., Crewe, W., (1998) The Parasites of Homo sapiens: An Annotated Checklist of the Protozoa, Helminths and Arthropods for Which We Are Home, , Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool; Brack, M., (1987) Agents Transmissible from Simians to Man, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin; Brown, J.H., (1995) Macroecology, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Coatney, G.R., Collins, W.E., McWilson, W., (1971) The Primate Malarias, , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland; Colwell, R.K., Lees, D.C., The mid-domain effect: Geometric constraints on the geography of species richness (2000) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 15, pp. 70-76; Corbet, G.B., Hill, J.E., (1991) A World List of Mammalian Species, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Cowlishaw, G., Hacker, J.E., Distribution, diversity, and latitude in African primates (1997) American Naturalist, 150, pp. 505-512; Cumming, G.S., Using habitat models to map diversity: Pan-African species richness of ticks (Acari: Ixodida) (2000) Journal of Biogeography, 27, pp. 425-440; Daszak, P., Cunningham, A.A., Hyatt, A.D., Emerging infectious diseases of wildlife: Threats to biodiversity and human health (2000) Science, 287, pp. 443-449; Deane, L.M., Ferreira Neto, J.A., Okumura, M., Ferreira, M.O., Malaria parasites of Brazilian monkeys (1969) Revista Do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo, 11, pp. 71-86; Dobson, A., Carper, R., Global warming and potential changes in host-parasite and disease-vector relationships (1992) Global Warming and Biodiversity, pp. 201-207. , ed. by R.L.
