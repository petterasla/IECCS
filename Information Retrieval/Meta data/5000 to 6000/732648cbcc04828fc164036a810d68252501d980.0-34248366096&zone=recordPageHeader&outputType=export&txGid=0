The long-term trends of the hydrological time series were detected using both parametric and nonparametric techniques. The results showed that the increasing tendency of the temperature has a 5% level of significance and the temperature increased by nearly 1°C over the past 50 years. The precipitation showed a significant increase in the 1980s and 1990s and the average annual precipitation exhibited an increasing trend with a magnitude of 6.8 mm per decade. A step change occurred in both the temperature and precipitation time series around 1986. The streamflow from the headwater of the Tarim River exhibited a significant increase during the last 20 years. The increase in temperature precipitation and streamflow may be attributed to global climate change. © 2007 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","climate change; precipitation; streamflow; Tarim River; temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Precipitation (meteorology); Rivers; Stream flow; Time series analysis; Water resources; Global climate change; Hydrological time series; Hydrology; rain; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Rivers; Stream flow; Time series analysis; Water resources; climate change; climate effect; global change; hydrological response; long-term change; precipitation (climatology); river basin; streamflow; time series analysis; water resource; article; China; climate; river; temperature; water flow; China; Climate; Rain; Rivers; Temperature; Water Movements; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Tarim Basin; Xinjiang Uygur",,,,,,"Belle, G., Hughes, J., Nonparametric tests for trend in water quality[J] (1984) Water Resour Res, 20, pp. 127-136; Bordi, I., Sutera, A., Fifty years of precipitation: Some spatially remote teleconnections[J] (2001) Water Resour Mgmt, 15 (4), pp. 247-280; Chen, Y., Li, W., Chen, Y., Water resources and ecological problems in Tarim River Basin, Xinjiang, China[M] (2003) Water and environmental management series[J], pp. 3-12. , IWA Publishing, UK; Chen, Y., Zhang, X., Li, W., Analysis on the ecological benefits of the steram water conveyance to the dried-up river of the lower reaches of Tarim River, China[J] (2004) Science in China(D), 47 (11), pp. 1053-1064; Franks, S., Assessing hydrological change: deterministic general circulation models or spurious solar correlation[J] (2002) Hydrological Processes, 16, pp. 559-564; Gan, T., Reducing vulnerability of water resources of Canadian Prairies to potential droughts and possible climate warming[J] (2000) Water Resources Management, 14 (2), pp. 111-135; Muttiah, R., Wurbs, R., Modeling the impacts of climate change on water supply reliabilities[J] (2002) Water International, 27 (3), pp. 407-419; Salinger, M., Basher, R., Fitzharris, B., Climate trends in the Southwest Pacific[J] (1995) International Journal of Climatology, 15, pp. 285-302; Salinger, M., Allan, R., Bindoff, N., Observed variability and change in climate and sea level in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific[M] (1996) Greenhouse: Coping with climate change, pp. 100-127. , Bouma W.J., Pearman G.I., and Manning M.R.
