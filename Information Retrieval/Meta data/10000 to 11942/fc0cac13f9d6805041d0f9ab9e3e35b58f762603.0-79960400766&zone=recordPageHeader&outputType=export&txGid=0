Increased nitrogen (N) availability induced by human activities and global warming may accelerate litter decomposition and affect soil organic C dynamics in wetlands. In the present study, we investigated the effect of N addition on decomposition of Calamagrostis angustifolia litters from freshwater marshes in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China under field and laboratory conditions. First, we assessed the changes in initial litter chemical composition and subsequent decomposition following three years of N addition at the rate of 24gNm-2year-1 under field conditions. Our results showed that N addition increased litter N concentration and decreased C/N ratio, and thus stimulated litter decomposition. Secondly, we examined the effect of increased N availability (0, 25, 50 and 100mgNg-1 litter) on litter decomposition under laboratory conditions. Increased exterior N availability also enhanced microbial respiration and increased litter mass loss under both waterlogging and non-waterlogging conditions. In addition, waterlogging conditions inhibited microbial respiration and suppressed litter mass loss. These findings demonstrated that N addition increased litter decomposition rates through improved litter quality and enhanced microbial activity in freshwater marshes of Northeast China. This implies that increased N availability accelerates litter decomposition rates, and thus may cause substantial losses of soil C and diminish and even reverse the C sink function of wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Litter quality; Mass loss; Microbial respiration; The sanjiang plain; Waterlogging; Wetlands","Litter quality; Mass loss; Microbial respiration; Sanjiang plain; Waterlogging; Forestry; Global warming; Organic carbon; Physiology; Soils; Vehicles; Wetlands; Decay (organic); carbon sink; chemical composition; decomposition; global warming; grass; human activity; litter; microbial activity; nutrient availability; organic carbon; reaction rate; respiration; soil organic matter; wetland; China; Heilongjiang; Sanjiang Plain; Calamagrostis angustifolia",,,,,,"Aerts, R., Climate, leaf litter chemistry and leaf litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems: a triangular relationship (1997) Oikos, 79, pp. 439-449; Aerts, R., Caluwe, H., Nutritional and plant-mediated controls on leaf litter decomposition of Carex species (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 244-260; Aerts, R., Logtestijn, R.S.P., Karlsson, P.S., Nitrogen supply differentially affects litter decomposition rates and nitrogen dynamics of sub-arctic bog species (2006) Oecologia, 146, pp. 652-658; Allison, S.D., Gartner, T.B., Mack, M.C., McGuire, K., Treseder, K., Nitrogen alters carbon dynamics during early succession in boreal forest (2010) Soil Biol.
