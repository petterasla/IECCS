One hundred years ago, Arrhenius too served as science adviser to government, and he emphasized the importance of internationalism. World War I ruptured the social relations of science, and marked the beginning of a complex intertwining of research with the realm of politics. This paper considers Arrhenius' response to this trend, and asks what he would have thought of today's situation when climatology has become a megascience. Some hints of a possible answer are given against the background of a review of Arrhenius' ideas on method, and his Darwinian perspective on the growth of scientific knowledge. In the course of this, the author makes some observations on how policy determination of scientific agendas introduces an organized social dimension, where the drive for consensus may contradict the traditional ideal of a 'Darwinian struggle of hypotheses', Arrhenius advocated. At the same time it is noted how the traditional ideal of science as neutral 'truth speaking to power' is constantly being resuscitated, among others by the leading echelon of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is suggested that the social dynamics of global-climate-change-science (or 'greenhouse research') may be understood in terms of a model of mutually reinforcing credibility cycles, linking science and politics.",,"Arrhenius; Darwinia",,,,,,"For a definition of the term, see section on New Policy DimensionsAirhenius, S., (1906) Mánniskan Infór Várldsgåtan, , Gebers fórlag, Stockholm; a 5th edition appeared already 1907, and many more editions were to follow.

(In Swedish); Among them were 15 natural scientists, six of these Nobel prize laureates and four later to receive the Nobel prizeHere I base myself on a study made by Levi Tansjö of the Chemistry Centre at Lund's University, making use of Arrhenius' correspondence with the Dutch chemist Ernst Cohen. I am grateful to professor Tansjö for sending me a pre-copy of this paper and copies of articles he has written on the history of chemistry, among other in Kenusk Tidskrifl 1987-1988. The paper consulted is entitled ""Die Widerstellung freundschaftlicher Bezeihungen zwischen den Gelehrten nach den 1. Weltkrieg. Bestrebungen von Svante Arrhenius und Ernst Cohen"". 12 pp. read at the Gesellschaft Osterreichischen Chemiker 12-13 April 1996 at the University of Innsbruck, Inst, for Analytical and Radiochemistry; esp. p. 3 ffIn Die Umschau, 1915, vol. 19, p. 187, cited after Tansjö, 1996, note 1 on p. 9. An article by Pierre Achalme, Director of the Laboratoire du Muséum in Paris, ""La science des civilisés et la Science allemande"" had been published in Umschau 25 Sept. 1915, and this was Arrhenius' comment after having been asked for his views by the editorsIn 1921 no prize was awarded in physics; Einstein received the 1921 prize in physics in 1922A curiosity that must be mentioned here is that Einstein, receiving the 1921 Nobel prize in physics in 1922, but unable to attend the ceremonies in Stockholm at that time (he was on a visit to Japan) gave his Nobel speech in Göteborg in connection with the Congress organized by Arrhenius. Perhaps appropriately the speech was delivered in the Concert Hall of the newly built Liseberg Amusement Park. The topic was relativity theory, a subject quite different from the one for which he had actually been awarded the prize by the cautious Swedish experimentalists. Cf. Elzinga, A. 1995.

(In Swedish). Tansjö notes too how O. Petersson pointed out that Arrhenius should have taken care to be a bit more generous in reviewing and comparing his own with earlier theories; Arrhenius, S., La conductibilité galvanique des electrolytes (1894) K. Vetenskapsakad, Sweden, P, p. 82; Arrhenius, S., La conductibilité galvanique des electrolytes (1894) K. Vetenskapsakad, Sweden, P, p. 88; Fallibilism is the name given to the view that hypotheses to be ""scientific"" need to be formulated in such a way that they may be empirically falsified, for example by looking for negative or falsifying evidence that can be brought to bear against them. This differs from the verifiability view according to which our strategy should be to seek primarily positive or verificatory evidenceIt is interesting to note how NASA's drive to gain attention recently has focused interest on stones from Mars that might bear signs of primitive life, perhaps opening up for new historiographical studies that might also bring forward Arrhenius' theory in a manner like modem greenhouse research did for the hypothesis of the greenhouse efffectSvante Arrhenius och pansermihypotesen (1967) Lychnos, Stockholm, p. 91; Arrhenius, G.O.S., Svante Arrhenius' contribution to earth science and cosmology (1959) Vetenskapsakdemiens Arsbok, 1959, pp. 65-81; T.C Chamberlain at the University of Chicago Was also a Like-minded Scientist.; The Journal ofTerreslial Physics was founded in 1896, the predecessor to today's Journal of Geophysical Research, which is affiliated with the American Geophysical Union, formed in 1919.

Post-normal science on the contrary is science with high level uncertainty in its ultimate knowledge claims while being under strong pressure to deliver policy relevant statements in clear and simple terms for use in public decisionmaking where diverse stakeholder interests pull in different directions; Proctor, R.N., (1991) Value-Free Science?
