Impact assessments of global warming have largely disregarded diel temperature oscillations, even though key processes in ecosystems, such as decomposition, may be affected. We tested the effect of a 5°C temperature increase with and without diel oscillations on litter decomposition by fungal communities in stream microcosms. Five temperature regimes with identical thermal sums (degree days) were applied: constant 3° and 8°C; diel temperature oscillations of 5°C around each mean; and oscillations of 9°C around 8°C Temperature oscillations around 8°C (warming scenario), but not 3°C (ambient scenario), accelerated decomposition by 18% (5°C oscillations) and 31% (9°C oscillations), respectively, compared to the constant temperature regime at 8°C Community structure was not affected by oscillating temperatures, although the rise in mean temperature from 3° to 8°C consistently shifted the relative abundance of species. A simple model using temperature-growth responses of the dominant fungal decomposers accurately described the experimentally observed pattern, indicating that the effect of temperature oscillations on decomposition in our warming scenario was caused by strong curvilinear responses of species to warming at low temperature, particularly of the species becoming most abundant at 8°C (Tetracladium marchalianum). These findings underscore the need to consider species-specific temperature characteristics in concert with changes in communities when assessing consequences of global warming on ecosystem processes. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Alatospora acuminata; Aquatic hyphomycetes; Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecosystem functioning; Fungal diversity; Heliscus lugdunensis; Litter decomposition; Microbial community structure; Stream microcosms; Tetracladium marchalianum","biodiversity; community structure; decomposition; fungus; global warming; litter; microbial community; microcosm; riparian vegetation; temperature effect; article; bioremediation; ecosystem; fungus; microbiology; physiology; river; temperature; time; tree; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ecosystem; Fungi; Rivers; Temperature; Time Factors; Trees; Alatospora acuminata; Hyphomycetes; Nectria lugdunensis; Tetracladium marchalianum",,,,,,"Aerts, R., The freezer defrosting: Global warming and litter decomposition rate in cold biomes (2006) Journal of Ecology, 94, pp. 713-724; Bärlocher, F., Community structure (1992) The ecology of aquatic hyphomycetes, pp. 38-76. , F.
