Flush floods propagate rapidly, which can lead to significant hazard to human life and property. Flood hazard to vehicles has become more noticeable and frequent in recent years. Therefore, it is important to investigate the behaviour of vehicles on flooded streets or roads. In the current study, a formula has been derived to predict the incipient velocity of flooded vehicles according to the mechanical condition of sliding equilibrium. A series of flume experiments were conducted using three types of scaled die-cast model vehicles, with two scales being tested for each type of vehicle. The experimental data obtained for the small-scale model vehicles were used to determine the two parameters in the derived formula, and the prediction accuracy of this formula was validated using the experimental data obtained for the large-scale model vehicles. Finally, the corresponding incipient velocities under various incoming depths were computed using this formula for these three prototype vehicles. It is found that for a specified vehicle, the value of incipient velocity reaches its minimum as the incoming flow depth approaches the height of the vehicle, and the smaller and lighter vehicle like Mini Cooper is the easiest to start sliding in floodwaters. The results can be used as a preliminary assessment to define the hazard to vehicles parking on flooded streets or roads. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Flood hazard; Flooded vehicles; Flume experiments; Incipient velocity; Urban flooding; Vehicle instability","climate change; flash flood; flooding; global warming; natural hazard",,,,,,"Bonham, A.J., Hattersley, R.T., (1967) Low level causeways, , University of New South Wales, Water Research Laboratory, Technical Report No. 100; Brigandì, G., Aronica, G.T., Bain, V., (2007) Flash-flood warning in a British catchment using a rainfall thresholds based approach: A case study, 9. , Geophysical Research Abstracts, EGU2007-A-02317; Chien, N., Wan, Z.H., Mechanics of sediment transport (1999) American Society of Civil Engineers, , Reston; Cox, R.J., Ball, E.J., Stability and safety in flooded streets (2001) Proceedings of conference on hydraulics in Civil Engineering, , The institution of Engineers, Australia; (2004) Living with the risk: the floods in Boscastle and North Cornwall on 16 Aug 2004, , Environment Agency Report, UK; (2006) Flood risks to people, , www.defra.gov.uk/environ/fcd/research, Phase 2 FD2321 Project Record.
