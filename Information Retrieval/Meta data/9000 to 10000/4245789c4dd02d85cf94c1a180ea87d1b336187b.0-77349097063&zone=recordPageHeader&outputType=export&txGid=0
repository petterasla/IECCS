Because of uncertainty in climate change and their effects, three climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2080 from three General Circulation Models (GCMs) were used to simulate a range of potential climate conditions for the state. These climate changes derive from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ""A1B"" storyline that assumes rapid global economic growth. The precipitation and temperature projections from the three GCMs for 2030 and 2080 were related to changes in five ecological provinces using the monthly record of temperature and precipitation from 1980 to 1997 for each 1 km cell across the state as aggregated into the provinces. Temperatures are projected to increase in all ecological provinces in all months for all three GCMs for both 2030 and 2080. Precipitation differences from the long-term average are more complex but less striking. The forest ecosystem model LINKAGES was used to simulate conditions for five ecological provinces from 1989 to 2300. Average output projects changes in tree diversity and species composition in all ecological provinces in Tennessee with the greatest changes in the Southern Mixed Forest province. Projected declines in total tree biomass are followed by biomass recovery as species replacement occurs in stands. The Southern Mixed Forest province results in less diversity in dominant trees as well as lower overall biomass than projections for the other four provinces. The biomass and composition changes projected in this study differ from forest dynamics expected without climate change. These results suggest that biomass recovery following climate change is linked to dominant tree diversity in the southeastern forest of the US. The generality of this observation warrants further investigation, for it relates to ways that forest management may influence climate change effects. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Diversity; Ecosystem model; Effects of global warming; Southeastern forests; Tennessee","As species; Climate change scenarios; Climate condition; Composition changes; Diversity; Ecological province; Ecosystem model; Forest dynamics; Forest ecosystem; Forest management; General circulation model; Global economic growth; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Life form; Mixed forests; Species composition; Storylines; Temperature projection; Total tree biomass; Transient response; Tree diversity; Biomass; Ecosystems; Forestry; Global warming; Climate models; biomass; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem modeling; forest dynamics; forest management; general circulation model; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mixed forest; simulation; uncertainty analysis; article; biomass distribution; climate change; economic development; environmental temperature; forest dynamics; forest management; geographic distribution; population recovery; priority journal; seasonal variation; species diversity; tree; United States; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Models, Biological; Rain; Southeastern United States; Temperature; Time Factors; Trees; Biomass; Climates; Diversification; Ecosystems; Forests; Mathematical Models; Seasonal Variation; Tennessee; United States",,,,,,"Aber, J., Neilson, R.P., McNulty, S., Lenihan, J.M., Bachelet, D., Drapek, R.J., Forest processes and global environmental change: predicting the effects of individual and multiple stressors (2001) BioScience, 51, pp. 735-751; Abrams, M.D., Where has all the white oak gone?
