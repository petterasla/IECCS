Twenty-eight light duty vehicles from five manufacturers (Ford, Toyota, Daimler Chrysler, General Motors,and Honda) were tested according to the USEPA (Federal) extended diurnal test procedure using the Sealed Housing for Evaporative Determination (SHED) apparatus. All tests were conducted using stationary vehicles with the motor and air conditioning system turned off. R-134a was measured using gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID). All vehicles exhibited measurable R-134a leakage over the 2-day diurnal test. Leak rates of R-134a ranged from 0.01 to 0.36 g/day with an average of 0.07 ± 0.07 g/day. When combined with leakage associated with vehicle operation, servicing, and disposal we estimate that the lifetime average R-134a emission rate from an AC equipped vehicle is 0.41± 0.27 g/day (the majority of emissions are associated with vehicle servicing and disposal). Assuming that the average vehicle travels 10 000 miles per year we estimate that the global warming impact of R-134a leakage from an AC equipped vehicle is approximately 4-5% of that of the CO2 emitted by the vehicle. The results are discussed with respect to the contribution of vehicle emissions to global climate change.",,"Flame ionization detectors (FID); Air conditioning; Carbon dioxide; Gas chromatography; Global warming; Ionization; Leakage (fluid); Light weight vehicles; Particulate emissions; Refrigerants; Environmental engineering; fluorinated hydrocarbon; air conditioning; atmospheric pollution; emission; gas chromatography; road transport; air analysis; air sampling; article; concentration (parameters); environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; gas chromatography; global climate; greenhouse effect; Aerosol Propellants; Air Conditioning; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Equipment Design; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Vehicle Emissions",,"Aerosol Propellants; Air Pollutants; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Vehicle Emissions; norflurane, 811-97-2",,,,"(1995) World Gasoline Diesel Fuel Survey, , Associated Octel, 23 Berkeley Square London W1X 6DT Fax 44-171-491-2332; Marland, G., Rotty, R.M., (1984) Tellus, 36, p. 232; Becker, K.H., Lörzer, J.C., Kurtenbach, R., Wiesen, P., Jensen, T.E., Wallington, T.J., (1999) Environ.
