This would replace fossil fuel-derived energy and reduce environmental impacts including global warming and acid rain. Although biomass energy is more costly than fossil fuel-derived energy, trends to limit carbon dioxide and other emissions through emission regulations, carbon taxes, and subsidies of biomass energy would make it cost competitive. Methane derived from anaerobic digestion is competitive in efficiencies and costs to other biomass energy forms including heat, synthesis gases, and ethanol.Methane derived from anaerobic digestion of fuel crops ad organic wastes represents a clean, renewable fuel that can displace fossil fuels and help mitigated global warming and acid rain. The principles and economics of methane generation via anaerobic digestion are examined, noting that biomass-derived methane is competitive in terms of costs and efficiencies with other biomass energy forms. Bioenergy incurs higher costs compared with fossil fuel-based energy, but efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through regulations, carbon taxes, and subsidies of bioenergy will render renewable methane cost-competitive.
