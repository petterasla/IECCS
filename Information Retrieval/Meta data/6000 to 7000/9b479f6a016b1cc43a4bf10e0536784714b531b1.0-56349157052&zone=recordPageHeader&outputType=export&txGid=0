Nevertheless, the contributions of the different radiative feedbacks to global warming (in equilibrium or transient conditions) and their comparison with the contribution of other processes (e.g., the ocean heat uptake) have not been quantified explicitly. Here these contributions from the classical feedback analysis framework are defined and quantified for an ensemble of 12 third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3)/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs. In transient simulations, the multimodel mean contributions to global warming associated with the combined water vapor-lapse-rate feedback, cloud feedback, and ocean heat uptake are comparable. However, intermodel differences in cloud feedbacks constitute by far the most primary source of spread of both equilibrium and transient climate responses simulated by GCMs. The spread associated with intermodel differences in cloud feedbacks appears to be roughly 3 times larger than that associated either with the combined water vapor-lapse-rate feedback, the ocean heat uptake, or the radiative forcing. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Control theory; Earth atmosphere; Feedback; Global warming; Vapors; Water vapor; Classical feedbacks; Climate feedback analyses; Combined waters; Coupled Model Intercomparison projects; External forcing; Feedbacks]; General circulation models; Global mean surface temperatures; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate changes; Multi models; Ocean heat uptakes; Ocean models; Primary sources; Radiative forcing; Rate feedbacks; Transient conditions; Transient simulations; Climate change; assessment method; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate feedback; estimation method; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; oceanic general circulation model; radiative forcing",,,,,,"Bony, S., Dufresne, J.-L., Marine boundary layer clouds at the heart of cloud feedback uncertainties in climate models (2005) Geophys.
