We analyzed a 20-year data set (1984-2003) from four sites in two northern California streams to examine the variability of bioassessment indices (two multivariate RIVPACS-type O/E scores and one multimetric index of biotic integrity, IBI), as well as eight metrics. All sites were sampled in spring; one site was also sampled in summer. Variability among years was high for most metrics (coefficients of variation, CVs ranging from 16% to 246% in spring) but lower for indices (CVs of 22-26% for the IBI and 21-32% for O/E scores in spring), which resulted in inconsistent assessments of biological condition. Variance components analysis showed that the time component explained variability in all metrics and indices, ranging from 5% to 35% of total variance explained. The site component was large (i.e., >40%) for some metrics (e.g., EPT richness), but nearly absent from others (e.g., Diptera richness). Seasonal analysis at one site showed that variability among seasons was small for some metrics or indices (e.g., Coleoptera richness), but large for others (e.g., EPT richness, O/E scores). Climatic variables did not show consistent trends across all metrics, although several were related to the El Niño Southern Oscillation Index at some sites. Bioassessments should incorporate temporal variability during index calibration or include climatic variability as predictive variables to improve accuracy and precision. In addition, these approaches may help managers anticipate alterations in reference streams caused by global climate change and high climatic variability.","Annual variability; Biomonitoring; Climate; Index of biotic integrity (IBI); Indices; Metrics; O/E scores","Annual variability; Biomonitoring; Climate; Index of biotic integrity (IBI); Indices; Metrics; O/E scores; Atmospheric pressure; Climate change; Nickel compounds; Quality assurance; Range finding; Springs (components); Metric system; annual variation; assessment method; beetle; biomonitoring; calibration; climate change; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Index of Biotic Integrity; multivariate analysis; species richness; temporal variation; article; benthos; climate change; community ecology; environmental monitoring; geomorphology; hydrology; nonhuman; seasonal variation; spring; stream (river); Animals; Biodiversity; California; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Invertebrates; Rivers; Seasons; Time; California; North America; United States; Coleoptera; Diptera",,,,,,"Bailey, C.R., Norris, R.H., Reynoldson, T.B., (2004) Bioassessment of Freshwater Ecosystems: Using the Reference Condition Approach, , Kluwer The Netherlands; Bêche, L.A., (2005) Long Term Variability, Disturbance, and Biological Traits of Aquatic Invertebrates in Mediterranean Climate Streams, , PhD Dissertation, University of California, Berkeley; Beche, L.A., Resh, V.H., Short-term climatic trends affect the temporal variability of macroinvertebrates in California 'Mediterranean' streams (2007) Freshwater Biology, 52 (12), pp. 2317-2339. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01859.x; Beche, L.A., Resh, V.H., Biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrates in California mediterranean-climate streams: Long-term annual variability and trait diversity patterns (2007) Fundamental and Applied Limnology, 169 (1), pp. 1-23. , DOI 10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0169-0001; Bêche, L.A., McElravy, E.P., Resh, V.H., Long-term seasonal variation in biological traits of benthic- macroinvertebrates in two Mediterranean-climate streams in California, U.S.A.
