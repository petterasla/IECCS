Within deep water bodies, the phytoplankton spring bloom provides a short time window of high food quantity and quality for herbivores. The onset of algal bloom development, however, varies strongly from year to year due to interannual variability in meteorological conditions. Furthermore, the onset is predicted to change with global warming. Here, we use a long-term dataset to study (a) how a cyclopoid copepod, Cyclops vicinus, is dealing with the large variability in phytoplankton bloom phenology, and (b) if bloom phenology has an influence on offspring numbers. C. vicinus performed a two-phase dormancy, that is, the actual diapause of fourth copepodid stages at the lake bottom is followed by a delay in maturation, that is, a quiescence, within the fifth copepodid stage until the start of the spring bloom. This strategy seems to guarantee a high temporal match of the food requirements for successful offspring development, especially through the highly vulnerable naupliar stages, with the phytoplankton spring bloom. However, despite this match with food availability in all study years, offspring numbers, that is, offspring survival rates were higher in years with an early start of the phytoplankton bloom. In addition, the phenology of copepod development suggested that also within study years, early offspring seems to have lower mortality rates than late produced offspring. We suggest that this is due to a longer predator-free time period and/or reduced time stress for development. Hence, within the present climate variability, the copepod benefited from warmer spring temperatures resulting in an earlier phytoplankton spring bloom. Time will show if the copepod's strategy is flexible enough to cope with future warming. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.","Climate change; Cyclops vicinus; Diapause; Match-mismatch; Maturation delay; Phenological adaptation; Photoperiod; Reproductive success; Time stress; Timing","adaptation; annual variation; climate effect; crustacean; data set; food availability; global warming; herbivore; life cycle; phenology; phytoplankton; reproduction; survival; algae; Copepoda; Cyclopoida; Cyclops vicinus",,,,,,"Adrian, R., Walz, N., Hintze, T., Hoeg, S., Rusche, R., Effects of ice duration on the plankton succession during spring in a shallow polymictic lake (1999) Freshwater Biology, 41, pp. 621-634; Alekseev, V.R., Destasio, B.T., Gilbert, J., (2007) Diapause in Aquatic Invertebrates, , Springer, New York, NY, USA; Bäuerle, E., Gaedke, U., Lake Constance - Characterization of an ecosystem in transition (1998) Archiv Für Hydrobiologie Special Issue Advances in Limnology, 53, pp. 1-610; Belsley, D.A., Kuh, E., Welsch, R.E., (1980) Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY, USA; Bollen, K., (1989) Structural Equations With Latent Variables, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY, USA; Both, C., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.E., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Brandl, Z., Fernando, C.H., The impact of predation by cyclopoid copepods on zooplankton (1981) Verhandlungen Der Internationalen Vereinigung Für Limnologie, 21, pp. 1573-1577; De Block, M., Campero, M., Stoks, R., Developmental costs of rapid growth in a damselfly (2008) Ecological Entomology, 33, pp. 313-318; De Block, M., Stoks, R., Compensatory growth and oxidative stress in a damselfly (2008) Proceedings of the Royal Society B - Biological Sciences, 275, pp. 781-785; Durant, J.M., Hjermann, D.O., Ottersen, G., Stenseth, N.C., Climate and the match or mismatch between predator requirements and resource availability (2007) Climate Research, 33, pp. 271-283; Eiane, K., Ohman, M.D., Stage-specific mortality of Calanus finmarchicus, Pseudocalanus elongatus and Oithona similis on Fladen Ground, North Sea, during a spring bloom (2004) Marine Ecology-Progress Series, 268, pp. 183-193; Einsle, U., Larvalentwicklung von Cyclopiden und Photoperiodik (1964) Naturwissenschaften, 14, p. 345; Einsle, U., (1993) Crustacea: Copepoda: Calanoida Und Cyclopoida - Süsswasserfauna Von Mitteleuropa, , Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany; Elgmork, K., Evolutionary aspects of diapause in freshwater copepods (1980) Evolution and Ecology of Zooplankton Communities, pp. 411-417. , In: (ed.
