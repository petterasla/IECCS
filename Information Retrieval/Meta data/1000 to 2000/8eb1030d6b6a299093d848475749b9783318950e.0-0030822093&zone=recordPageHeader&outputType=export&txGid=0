Very little attention, however, has been given to the effect of volcanic eruptions on patterns of storminess. Here we present a historical record of gale-day frequency for Edinburgh, Scotland, extending from AD 1780 to 1988 (the Mossman-Hichey chronology), which we believe represents the longest historical record of gales in Europe. Calculation of galeday frequency for this time interval shows three clear peaks in storminess that follow the volcanic eruptions of Tambora (1815), Krakatoa (1883) and El Chichon (1982). It appears that the greatest periods of storminess evident in the Edinburgh record during the last 200 years have taken place during relatively short intervals following major episodes of volcanism. If correct, the processes linking high-magnitude volcanic eruptions to storminess in the North Atlantic need to he included in IPCC research that presently focuses most attention on linkages between increased storminess and the effects of global warming.","Edinburgh; El Chichon; Gale days; Krakatoa; Scotland; Storminess; Tambora; Volcanism","climate change; climate record; gale; palaeoclimate; storminess; volcanic eruption; UK, Scotland, Lothian, Edinburgh",,,,,,"(1992) Volcanism and Climate Change, pp. 1-27. , Special Report, May 1992; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., (1994) Time Series Analysis Forecasting and Control, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ and London: Prentice-Hall; Bradley, R.S., Jones, P.D., Records of explosive volcanic eruptions over the last 500 years (1995) Climates since 1850, pp. 606-622. , Bradley, R.S. and Jones, P.D., editors, London: Routledge; Franzen, L.G., The changing frequency of gales on the Swedish west coast and its possible relation to the increased damage to coniferous forests of southern Sweden (1991) International Journal of Climatology, 11, pp. 769-793; Graf, H.-F., Kirchner, I., Robock, A., Schult, I., Pinatubo eruption winter climate effects: Model versus observations (1993) Climate Dynamics, 9, pp. 81-93; Graf, H.F., Perlwitz, J., Kirchner, I., Northern Hemisphere tropospheric midlatitude circulation after violent volcanic eruptions (1994) Contributions to Atmospheric Physics, 67, pp. 3-13; Groisman, P.Y., Possible regional climate consequences of the Pinatubo eruption: An empirical approach (1992) Geophysical Research Letters, 19, pp. 1603-1606; Houghton, J.T., Meira, L.G., Callander, B.A., Harris, N., Kattenberg, A., Maskell, K., (1996) Climate Change 1995; the Science of Climate Change, 572p. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Hurrell, J.W., Decadal trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation: Regional temperature and precipitation (1995) Nature, 269, pp. 676-679; Kelly, P.M., Jones, P.D., Pengqun, J., The spatial response of the climate system to explosive volcanic eruptions (1996) International Journal of Climatology, 16, pp. 537-550; Kirchner, I., Graf, H.-F., Volcanoes and El Niño: Signal separation in Northern Hemisphere winter (1995) Climate Dynamics, 11, pp. 341-358; Krueger, A., Sightings of El Chichon sulphur dioxide clouds with the Nimbus 7 total ozone mapping spectrometer (1983) Science, 220, pp. 1377-1379; Kuhn, G.G., Shepard, F.P., Importance of phreatic volcanism in producing abnormal weather conditions (1983) Journal of the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, 51 (4), pp. 19-29; (1991) Sea Cliffs, Beaches and Coastal Valleys of San Diego County: Some Amazing Histories and Some Horrifying Implications, 193p. , Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press; Lamb, H.H., (1982) Climate History in the Modern World, , London: Methuen; McCracken, M.C., Luther, F.M., Preliminary estimate of the radiative and climative effects of the El Chichon eruption (1984) Geofisica Internacional, 23, pp. 385-401; (1991) Meteorological Glossary, 335p. , London: HMSO Publication, Met.
