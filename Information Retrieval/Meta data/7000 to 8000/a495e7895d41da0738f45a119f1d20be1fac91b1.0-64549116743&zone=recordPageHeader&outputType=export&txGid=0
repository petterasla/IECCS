Ideally, the injected greenhouse gas stays in the injection zone for a geologic time, eventually dissolves in the formation brine and remains trapped by mineralization. However, one of the potential problems associated with the geologic method of sequestration is that naturally present or inadvertently created conduits in the cap rock may result in a gas leakage from primary storage. Even in supercritical state, the carbon dioxide viscosity and density are lower than those of the formation brine. Buoyancy tends to drive the leaked CO2plume upward. Theoretical and experimental studies of buoyancy-driven supercritical CO2 flow, including estimation of time scales associated with plume evolution and migration, are critical for developing technology, monitoring policy, and regulations for safe carbon dioxide geologic sequestration. In this study, we obtain simple estimates of vertical plume propagation velocity taking into account the density and viscosity contrast between CO2 and brine. We describe buoyancy-driven countercurrent flow of two immiscible phases by a Buckley-Leverett type model. The model predicts that a plume of supercritical carbon dioxide in a homogeneous water-saturated porous medium does not migrate upward like a bubble in bulk water. Rather, it spreads upward until it reaches a seal or until it becomes immobile. A simple formula requiring no complex numerical calculations describes the velocity of plume propagation. This solution is a simplification of a more comprehensive theory of countercurrent plume migration [Silin, D., Patzek, T.W., Benson, S.M., 2007. A Model of Buoyancy-driven Two-phase Countercurrent Fluid Flow. Laboratory Report LBNL-62607. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA]. In a layered reservoir, the simplified solution predicts a slower plume front propagation relative to a homogeneous formation with the same harmonic mean permeability. In contrast, the model yields much higher plume propagation estimates in a high-permeability conduit like a vertical fracture. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Buoyancy; Countercurrent flow; Geologic sequestration; Plume migration","Atmospheric emissions; Bulk waters; Cap rocks; Counter currents; Countercurrent flow; Experimental studies; Fluid flows; Front propagation; Gas leakages; Gas plumes; Geologic methods; Geologic sequestration; Geological formations; Green house gas; Harmonic means; Heterogeneous porous mediums; Immiscible phasis; Lawrence berkeley national laboratories; Layered reservoirs; Model yields; N-o complexes; Numerical calculations; One-dimensional models; Plume migration; Plume propagation; Potential problems; Saturated porous mediums; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Supercritical CO; Supercritical state; Time-scales; Vertical fractures; Viscosity contrasts; Air pollution; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Buoyancy; Capillarity; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Leakage (fluid); Mineralogy; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Porous materials; Technological forecasting; Viscosity; Water injection; Supercritical fluid extraction; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric plume; buoyancy; carbon dioxide; density; experimental study; global warming; mineralization; one-dimensional modeling; porous medium; solubility; supercritical flow; theoretical study; viscosity",,,,,,"Al-Futaisi, A., Patzek, T.W., Impact of wettability on two-phase flow characteristics of sedimentary rock: Quasi-static model (2003) Water Resources Res., 39 (2), pp. 1042-1055; Bedrikovetsky, P., De Deus, J., Altoé, J.E., Secondary migration of oil: analytical model.
