The emission of PFCs has been targeted for reduction due to the contribution of these species to global warming. An option under investigation is the use of alternative compounds that emit lower amounts of global warming species. The current study presents chamber cleaning times and emissions from the use of one such species, trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA), in a widely used commercial PECVD tool, the Novellus Concept One 200. A central composite design-of-experiments was employed to calculate response surfaces for the chamber clean time and PFC emission concentrations as the chamber pressure, TFAA flow rate, and oxygen flow rate were varied. The chamber clean times were measured using optical emission spectroscopy, quadrupole mass spectrometry, as well as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and the PFC emissions were quantified using FTIR spectroscopy. The performance of TFAA is compared to standard Novellus Concept One 200 C2F6 and C 3F8 chamber cleaning processes and to processes in which the effect of augmentation of C2F6 with NF3 is studied. © 1998 American Vacuum Society.",,"Central composite designs; Chamber cleaning; Chamber pressure; Chamber-cleaning process; Clean chemistry; Emission concentration; Environmental issues; FTIR spectroscopy; Oxygen flow rates; Perfluorinated compounds; Quadrupole mass spectrometry; Response surface; Semiconductor industry; Trifluoroacetic anhydrides; Chemical cleaning; Chemical compounds; Chemical vapor deposition; Emission spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Global warming; Leakage (fluid); Mass spectrometry; Oxygen; Plasma deposition; Semiconductor device manufacture; Optical emission spectroscopy",,,,,,"Dutrow, E., (1996) Proceedings from the SEMI Technical Program: A Partnership for PFC Emissions Reduction, pp. 137-138. , Austin, TX; Sun, S.-P., Lam, K.-S., Lauv, H., Ngo, M.V., (1997) Proceedings from the SEMI Technical Program: Perfluoro Compound Technical Update, , San Francisco, CA, paper.
