The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals are reasonably captured. The strength of the jet significantly increases from the late 17th century to late 19th century. The decreasing in reconstructed jet in 20th century disagrees with previous studies which indicated an enhancement of Southern Asian summer monsoon (SASM) in association with the rapid global warming. The jet reconstructions are useful for understanding of SASM variability and the validation of historical monsoon simulation.
