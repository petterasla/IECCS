This study ascertained the dynamic emission of nitrous oxide (N 2O) from a paddy field under a rice-duck farming system in South China. Two different cultivation and fertilizer treatments, namely, organic fertilizer + ducks (OF+D) and chemical fertilizer + ducks (CF+D) treatments, were employed in this study. Experimental data showed that diurnal variations of N 2O emission were highly correlated with the activities of ducklings. The rates of N 2O emission were normally increased in the early morning and late afternoon due to the frequent movement of ducklings at these time periods. Our study further revealed that the rates of N 2O emission from the paddy field varied with the types of fertilizers used as well as with the stages of the rice growth. In general, the rates of N 2O emission were higher for the CF+D treatment than for the OF+D treatment, whereas more N 2O was emitted from the paddy field at the tillering stage than at the heading stage. The global warming potential with the use of the organic fertilizer was about 22% lower than with the use of the chemical fertilizer. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Fertilizer types; N 2O emission; Paddy field; Rice-duck farming","fertilizer; nitrous oxide; cultivation; diurnal variation; emission; farming system; fertilizer application; global warming; movement; nitrous oxide; paddy field; rice; waterfowl; article; China; controlled study; duck; farming system; nonhuman; priority journal; rice; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Animals; Chickens; China; Ducks; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Manure; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza sativa; Phosphorus; Potassium; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Anas",,"nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Air Pollutants; Fertilizers; Manure; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Potassium, 7440-09-7",,,,"Brady, N.C., (1984) The Nature and Properties of Soils, , 9 Macmillian New York; (2002), http://www.ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/n2o/insituGcs/global/, Climate monitoring and diagnostic laboratory (CMDL) of the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration, Boulder, CO (N2O data available at:)Grosso, S.J.D., Parton, W.J., Mosier, A.R., Walsh, M.K., Ojima, D.S., Thornton, P.E., DAYCENT national-scale simulations of nitrous oxide emissions from cropped soils in the United States (2006) J Environ Qual, 35, pp. 1451-1460; Huang, Y., Wang, H., Huang, H., Feng, Z.W., Yang, Z.H., Luo, Y.C., Characteristics of methane emission from wetland rice-duck complex ecosystem (2005) Agr Ecosyst Environ, 105, pp. 181-193; (2001) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Technical Summary of the 3rd Assessment Report of Working Group 1, , IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).
