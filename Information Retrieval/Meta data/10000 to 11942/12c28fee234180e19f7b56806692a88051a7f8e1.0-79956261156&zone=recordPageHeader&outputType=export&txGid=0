A number of studies published over the past few decades have documented changes in the climate of Hawai'i that are generally consistent with expectations from climate change projections, such as those found in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report (IPCC, 2007). In this study we examine a suite of climate variables that are important from the point of view of ecosystem impacts, but that also relate to societal concerns such Island water resources. Our results are consistent with previous studies in showing a significant warming trend, especially evident at higher elevations. In particular, we document a decrease in the frequency of occurrence of freezing temperatures in the upper slopes of the higher terrain on Maui and the Big Island and a concomitant rise in the freezing level surface in the region that is in good agreement with analogous studies done for other mountainous areas of the world. Temperatures at standard reference surfaces in the free atmosphere have warmed throughout the troposphere, with a maximum near the 850. mb level. The warming peak at this level could be associated with an increased frequency of occurrence and/or lowering of the trade wind inversion layer. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Hawaii climate change; Mountain areas; Temperature and humidity","Climate change projections; Climate variables; Freezing levels; Freezing temperatures; Hawaii climate change; Hawaiian Islands; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Mean temperature; Mountain areas; Mountainous area; Resource managers; Societal concerns; Trade winds; Vertical profile; Atmospherics; Freezing; Global warming; Landforms; Water resources; Atmospheric temperature; climate effect; climate prediction; climate variation; drought; global warming; humidity; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; inversion layer; mountain region; regional climate; temperature profile; trade wind; troposphere; vertical profile; water resource; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; United States",,,,,,"Bradley, R.S., Keimig, F.T., Diaz, H.F., Hardy, D.R., Recent changes in freezing level heights in the Tropics with implications for the deglacierization of high mountain regions (2009) Geophys.
