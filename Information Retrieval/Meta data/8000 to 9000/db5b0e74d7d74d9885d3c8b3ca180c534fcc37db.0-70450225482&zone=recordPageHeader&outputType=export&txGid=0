Given a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, fully 75% of the tropical forests present in 2000 will experience mean annual temperatures in 2100 that are greater than the highest mean annual temperature that supports closed-canopy forest today. Temperature-sensitive species might extend their ranges to cool refuges, defined here as areas where temperatures projected for 2100 match 1960s temperatures in the modern range. Distances to such cool refuges are greatest for equatorial species and are particularly large for key tropical forest areas including the Amazon and Congo River Basins, West Africa, and the upper elevations of many tropical mountains. In sum, tropical species are likely to be particularly sensitive to global warming because they are adapted to limited geographic and seasonal variation in temperature, already lived at or near the highest temperatures on Earth before global warming began, and are often isolated from cool refuges. To illustrate these three points, we examined the distributions and habitat associations of all extant mammal species. The distance to the nearest cool refuge exceeded 1000 km for more than 20% of the tropical and less than 4% of the extratropical species with small ranges. The biological impact of global warming is likely to be as severe in the tropics as at temperate and boreal latitudes. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Climate change; Cool refuges; Extinction threat; Global warming; Land cover; Mammals; Range extension; Range shift; Tropical forest","ecological impact; extinction risk; forest canopy; future prospect; global warming; greenhouse gas; mammal; population distribution; range expansion; refuge; seasonal variation; tropical forest; animal; animal behavior; article; biodiversity; environmental protection; geography; greenhouse effect; mammal; physiology; season; species extinction; temperature; tropic climate; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Extinction, Biological; Geography; Global Warming; Homing Behavior; Mammals; Seasons; Temperature; Tropical Climate; Africa; Amazon Basin; Congo Basin; South America; Sub-Saharan Africa; Mammalia",,,,,,"Asner, G.P., Rudel, T.K., Aide, T.M., Defries, R., Emerson, R., Forest tsunami: Global humid tropical forest change in the 21st century (2009) Conservation Biology, 23, pp. 1386-1395; Brook, B.W., Bradshaw, C.J.A., Strength of density dependence in abundance time series of 1198 species (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 1445-1451; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., Tropical secondary forests (1990) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 6, pp. 1-32; Bush, M.B., Distributional change and conservation on the Andean flank: A palaeoecological perspective (2002) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 11, pp. 463-473; Bush, M.B., Silman, M.R., McMichael, C., Saatchi, S., Fire, climate change and biodiversity in Amazonia: A Late-Holocene perspective (2008) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 363, pp. 1795-1802; Chambers, J.Q., Higuchi, N., Schimel, J.P., Ancient trees in Amazonia (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 135-136; Chazdon, R.L., Peres, C.A., Dent, D., Sheil, D., Lugo, A.E., Lamb, D., Stork, N.E., Miller, S., Assessing the potential for species conservation in tropical secondary forests (2009) Conservation Biology, 23, pp. 1406-1417; Chen, I.-C., Shiu, H.-J., Benedick, S., Holloway, J.D., Chey, V.K., Barlow, H.S., Hill, J.K., Thomas, C.D., Elevation increases in moth assemblages over 42 years on a tropical mountain (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, pp. 1479-1483; Chesson, P., Mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 343-366; Christensen, J.H., Regional climate projections (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
