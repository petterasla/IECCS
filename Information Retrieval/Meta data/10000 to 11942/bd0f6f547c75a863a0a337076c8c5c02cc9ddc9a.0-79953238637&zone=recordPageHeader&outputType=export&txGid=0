Using a life cycle assessment approach, we assessed the influence of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions on the life cycle global warming potential of the production and combustion of biodiesel from canola oil produced in a semiarid climate. Utilizing locally measured soil N2O emissions, rather than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default values, decreased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production and combustion of 1 GJ biodiesel from 63 to 37 carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e)/GJ. GHG were 1.1 to 2.1 times lower than those from petroleum or petroleum-based diesel depending on which soil N2O emission factors were included in the analysis. The advantages of utilizing biodiesel rapidly declined when blended with petroleum diesel. Mitigation strategies that decrease emissions from the production and application of N fertilizers may further decrease the life cycle GHG emissions in the production and combustion of biodiesel. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Biodiesel production; Canola oil; Climate cooling; Default values; Emission factors; Fertilizer applications; GHG emission; Global warming potential; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Life-cycle assessments; Mitigation strategy; N fertilizers; Nitrous oxide; Petroleum diesel; Petroleum fuels; Semi-arid climate; Semi-arid environments; Biodiesel; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Rating; Soils; Life cycle; biodiesel; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; petroleum; rapeseed oil; air-soil interaction; alternative fuel; atmospheric pollution; biofuel; carbon dioxide; combustion; diesel; emission control; essential oil; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; life cycle analysis; nitrous oxide; petroleum; semiarid region; soil emission; article; atmospheric dispersion; biofuel production; combustion; controlled study; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; reference value; semiarid climate; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biofuels; Carbon Footprint; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fertilizers; Nitrogen Dioxide; Brassica napus var. napus",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; petroleum, 8002-05-9; rapeseed oil, 8002-13-9; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Fertilizers; Nitrogen Dioxide, 10102-44-0",,,,"Huo, H., Wang, M., Bloyd, C., Putsche, V., Life Cycle Assessment of Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Soybean-Derived Biodiesel and Renewable Fuels (2009) Environ.
