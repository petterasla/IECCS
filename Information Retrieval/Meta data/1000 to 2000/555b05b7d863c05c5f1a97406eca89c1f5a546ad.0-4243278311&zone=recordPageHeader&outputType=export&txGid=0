There is an increasing concern surrounding the emission levels of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This paper is an extension of earlier work(1) to show how cogeneration concepts can be used to reduce production costs by simultaneously producing electricity, CO2 and steam for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Carbon dioxide recovery; Cogeneration; Enhanced oil recovery; Greenhouse effect",,,,,,,"Tontiwachwuthikul, P., Carbon dioxide production from cogeneration for enhanced oil recovery: An economic evaluation (1996) The Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology, 35, pp. 27-33. , June; Cogeneration Systems, p. 8. , San Diego, California; Jennings, A.R., (1991) Use of CO2/Steam to Enhance Floods in Horizontal Wellbores, , Jan.
