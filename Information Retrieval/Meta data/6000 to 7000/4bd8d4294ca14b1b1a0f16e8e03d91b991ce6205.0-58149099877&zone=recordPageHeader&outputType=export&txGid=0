Since local environmental conditions vary along latitudinal clines, latitude has become an essential component in projecting plant response to warming. Three ecotypes of Arabidopsis were selected from varying latitudes in order to investigate heat stress within an ecotype and project potential effects across a gradient. Control and heat stressed groups received 12 hour photoperiods. Control plants were grown at 22.7/22.7° C day/night mean temperatures and heat stressed plants were grown at 22.7/29° C day/night mean temperatures. Plants were quantified and harvested 35 days after sowing. The number of rosette leaves, flower buds, and fruits resulted in significant differences both between control and heat stressed plants of the same ecotype and also across ecotypes. Heat overwhelmingly resulted in a quantitative decrease across all parameters, including overall plant size, with the exception of flowers in ecotype 902. And even though the heat stressed 902 plants flowered while the control group plants did not, neither produced fruit. Thus, heat adversely affects growth and development as well as reproductive success in Arabidopsis. © 2008, Penkala Bt.","Arabidopsis; Global warming; Heat stress","Arabidopsis",,,,,,"Betts, R.A., Contrasting Physiological and structural vegetation feedbacks in climate change simulations (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 796-799; Bisseling, T., Weigel, D., Plant development: From cell fate to organ formation (2001) Plant Cell, 13, pp. 221-227; Bowman, J.L., Smyth, D.R., Meyerowitz, E.M., Genes directing flower development in Arabidopsis (1989) The Plant Cell, 1, pp. 37-52; Caicedo, A.L., Stinchcombe, J.R., Olsen, K.M., Schmitt, J., Purugganan, M.D., Epistatic interaction between Arabidopsis FRI and FLC flowering time genes generates a latitudinal cline in a life history trait (2004) P.
