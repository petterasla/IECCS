Objectives: In this commentary I highlight current scientific evidence indicating that the fetus and young child are at heightened risk of developmental impairment, asthma, and cancer from fossil fuel pollutants and from the predicted effects of climate disruption such as heat waves, flooding, infectious disease, malnutrition, and trauma. Increased risk during early development derives from the inherently greater biologic vulnerability of the developing fetus and child and from their long future lifetime, during which early insults can potentially manifest as adult as well as childhood disease. I cite recent reports concluding that reducing dependence on fossil fuel and promoting clean and sustainable energy is economically feasible. Discussion: Although much has been written separately about the toxicity of fossil fuel burning emissions and the effects of climate change on health, these two faces of the problem have not been viewed together with a focus on the developing fetus and child. Adolescence and old age are also periods of vulnerability, but the potential for both immediate and long-term adverse effects is greatest when exposure occurs prenatally or in the early years. Conclusions: Consideration of the full spectrum of health risks to children from fossil fuel combustion underscores the urgent need for environmental and energy policies to reduce fossil fuel dependence and maximize the health benefits to this susceptible population. We do not have to leave our children a double legacy of ill health and ecologic disaster.","Asthma; Cancer; Climate change; Energy; Fetal and child development; Fossil fuel; Susceptibility","carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; metal; nitrogen oxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfur oxide; air pollution; asthma; cancer risk; carcinogenicity; child; child development; child health care; climate change; combustion; developmental disorder; disease predisposition; environmental exposure; environmental health; feasibility study; fetus development; flooding; global climate; greenhouse effect; health hazard; high risk population; human; infection; injury; long term exposure; malnutrition; note; policy; pollutant; pollution; poverty; prediction; prenatal exposure; priority journal; racism; risk assessment; risk reduction; vulnerable population; air pollutant; article; child welfare; drug effect; economics; female; fetus; infant; legal aspect; newborn; pregnancy; preschool child; social psychology; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Child; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fetus; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Exposure; Poverty; Pregnancy; Prejudice; Risk Assessment",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; sulfur oxide, 12624-32-7; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Fossil Fuels",,,,"Adam, E., Kaufman, R.H., Adler-Storthz, K., Melnick, J.L., Dreesman, G.R., A prospective study of the association of herpes simplex virus and human papillomavirus infection with cervical neoplasia in women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero (1985) Int J Cancer, 35, pp. 19-26; Global Climate Change and Children's Health (2007) Pediatrics, 120, pp. 1149-1152. , American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Environmental Health; Climatic heat stress and the exercising child and adolescent (2000) Pediatrics, 106, pp. 158-159. , American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Sports Medicine and Fitness; (2007) Cancer Facts and Figures 2007, , http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2007PWSecured.pdf, Atlanta, GA:American Cancer Society.
