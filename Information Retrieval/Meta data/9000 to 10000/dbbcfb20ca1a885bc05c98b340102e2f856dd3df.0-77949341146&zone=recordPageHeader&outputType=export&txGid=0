Sanitary Landfill, Incineration and gasification-pyrolysis of the waste treatment technologies are studied in SimaPro software based on input-output materials flow. SimaPro software has been applied for analyzing environmental burden by different impact categories. All technologies are favorable to abiotic and ozone layer depletion due to energy recovery from the waste treatment facilities. Sanitary landfill has the significantly lower environmental impact among other thermal treatment while gases are used for fuel with control emission environment. However, sanitary landfill has significant impact on photochemical oxidation, global warming and acidification. Among thermal technology, pyrolysis-gasification is comparatively more favorable to environment than incineration in global warming, acidification, eutrophication and eco-toxicity categories. Landfill with energy recovery facilities is environmentally favorable. However, due to large land requirement, difficult emission control system and long time span, restriction on land filling is applying more in the developed countries. Pyrolysis-gasification is more environmental friendly technology than incineration due to higher energy recovery efficiency. Life cycle assessment is an effective tool to analyze waste treatment technology based on environmental performances. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.","Environmental assessment; Incineration; Pyrolysis-gasification; Sanitary landfill; Waste-to-energy","acidification; comparative study; energy efficiency; environmental impact; eutrophication; global warming; incineration; landfill; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; ozone depletion; photochemistry; pyrolysis; software; waste treatment",,,,,,"Barton, J.R., Patel, V.S., Life cycle assessment for waste management (1996) Waste Manage, 16 (1-3), pp. 35-50. , (16 pages); Bilitewski, B., Winkler, J., Comparative evaluation of life cycle assessment models for solid waste management (2007) Waste Manage, 27 (8), pp. 1021-1031. , (11 pages); Björklund, A., Finnveden, G., Life cycle assessment of a national policy proposal - The case of a Swedish waste incineration tax (2007) Waste Manage, 27 (8), pp. 1046-1058. , (13 pages); Björklund, A., (2000) Environmental Systems Analysis of Waste Management: Experiences From Applications of The Orware Model, , P.hD.
