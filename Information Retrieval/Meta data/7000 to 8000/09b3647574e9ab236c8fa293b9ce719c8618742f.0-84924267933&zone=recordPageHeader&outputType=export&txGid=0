We show here that the external cyclic influences of cosmic origin that modulate the earth’s climate may either reinforce or mitigate the ‘local’ terrestrial forcings. Among the external influences is cosmic radiation, whose intensity shows a cyclic variation of 11 years, accompanying the 11-year cycle of solar activity. We put forward a mechanism to explain how the emission of particulate matter into the atmosphere might influence global lightning activity. With respect to global lightning activity, we show why, during the 11-year cycle, the influence of an increase in particulate matter concentration in the atmosphere may be negligible in some years, while it will be reinforced in other years, depending on the place of the years in the cycle. We also remark that the effect on global warming of fossil fuel burning is also modulated by the cosmic ray flux, whose influence is mediated by the variation that it promotes on the cloud cover. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","atmosphere; coal; electric field; fuel; global warming",,,,,,,"Bali Agreement, (2007), http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/index.php/csw/details/bali_climate _declaration/Hansen, J., Nazarenko, L., Ruedy, R., Sato, M., Willis, J., Del Genio, A., Koch, D., Earth’s energy imbalance: confirmation and implications (2005) Science, 308, pp. 1431-1435; Hansen, J., Sato, M., Greenhouse gas growth rates (2004) Proc.
