However, it can still be questioned if biomass-based energy generation is a good environmental choice with regards to the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and if there are negative consequences of using of agricultural land for other purposes than food production. In this study, a simplified life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted over four scenarios for supply of the entire demand of power and heat of a rural village. Three of the scenarios are based on utilization of biomass in 100 kW (e) combined heat and power (CHP) systems and the fourth is based on fossil fuel in a large-scale plant. The biomass systems analyzed were based on 1) biogas production with ley as substrate and the biogas combusted in a microturbine, 2) gasification of willow chips and the product gas combusted in an IC-engine and 3) combustion of willow chips for a Stirling engine. The two first scenarios also require a straw boiler. The results show that the biomass-based scenarios reduce greenhouse gas emissions considerably compared to the scenario based on fossil fuel, but have higher acidifying emissions. Scenario 1 has by far the best performance with respect to global warming potential and the advantage of utilizing a byproduct and thus not occupying extra land. Scenario 2 and 3 require less primary energy and less fossil energy input than 1, but set-aside land for willow production must be available. The low electric efficiency of scenario 3 makes it an unsuitable option. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogas; CHP; Gasification; Green manure; LCA; Willows","Agricultural land; Biogas production; CHP; Combined heat and power plants; Combined heat and power system; Comparative life cycle assessment; Electric efficiency; Energy generations; Farm land; Food production; Fossil energy; Global warming potential; Green manure; If there are; LCA; Micro turbine; Primary energies; Product gas; Renewable fuels; Rural villages; Simplified life cycle assessment; Willows; Biogas; Biomass; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gasification; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Rural areas; Small power plants; Stirling engines; Life cycle; agricultural land; biomass; carbon emission; energy crop; food production; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; manure; power generation; renewable resource; village; Chandipura virus; Salix",,,,,,"(2009) EC, Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, , OJ L140/6; (2006) How much bioenergy can Europe produce without harming the environment?, , EEA, European Environment Agency, Copenhagen; Novak-Zdravkovic, A., De Ruyck, J., Small-scale power generation from biomass (2005) 14th European Biomass Conference, , Paris; (2007) Environment, G.F.M.f.t., Renewable energy sources act - progress report 2007; Obernberger, I., Carlsen, H., Biedermann, F., State-of-the-art and future developments regarding small-scale biomass CHP systems with a special focus on ORC and Stirling engine technologies (2003) International Nordic Bioenergy 2003 Conference.; Henriksen, U., Ahrenfeldt, J., Jensen, T.K., Gøbel, B., Bentzen, J.D., Hindsgaul, C., The design, construction and operation of a 75 kW two-stage gasifier (2006) Energy, 31 (10-11), pp. 1542-1553; Kløverpris, J., (2008) Consequential life cycle inventory modelling of land use induced by crop consumption, , Department of Management Engineering, Technical University of Denmark; Börjesson, P., Good or bad bioethanol from a greenhouse gas perspective - what determines this?
