Eocene-Oligocene Anjihaihe formation mainly deposite gray or dark gray lacustrine mudstone with flat bedding; Late Oligocene Shawan formation are overlain purple meander sandstone, siltstone and interbedded conglomerate are dominant; the lower of Early Miocene Taxihe formation consist of gray or brownish siltstone and mudstone frequently coexist; the upper are brownish or gray-yellowish sandstone with interbedded siltstone; Late Miocene-Early Pliocene Dushanzi formation are composed of braided-fluvial accumulation of dark gray conglomerate or associated with brownish or gray-yellowish sandstone; Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene Xiyu formation consist of a large amount of alluvial fan pebble to boulder conglomerate. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic data show: average δ13 C values from Eocene-Oligocene, through Late Oligocene, lower of Early Miocene, upper of Early Miocene, Late Miocene-Early Pliocene to Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene are ∼ - 3.9‰, ∼ - 8.1‰, ∼ - 5.9‰, ∼ - 8.5‰, ∼ - 6.0‰, respectively, while average δ 18O values are ∼ - 5.0‰, ∼ - 11.0‰, ∼ - 7.7‰, ∼ - 10.3‰, ∼ - 10.4‰ respectively. Stable isotopic changes and sedimentary records indicate paleoenvironmental changes: warm-wet during Eocene-Oligocene, arid and cold during Late Oligocene, semi-humid and semi-warm during lower of Early Miocene, arid and cold during upper of Early Miocene, arid and cold during Late Miocene- Early Pliocene, arid and semi-warm during Late Pliocene to Pleistocene. Combined with paleomagnetic data in this area, stable isotopic results, sedimentary records and global climate change, five paleoenvironmental changes have developed in northern Tianshan since the late Cenozoic: climate conversion during late of Qligocene, climate break at Early Miocene (∼ 24Ma), climate conversion during early of Miocene(24 - 19Ma), C4 rapidly expand at Late Miocene( ∼ 7Ma) and climate intensely vibrate at Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene (∼ 3.17Ma).","Late Cenozoic; Northern Tianshan; Paleoenvironmental changes; Sedimentary records; Stable isotopic changes","Cenozoic; conglomerate; Eocene-Oligocene boundary; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; sandstone; siltstone; stable isotope; uplift; Asia; Eurasia; Tien Shan",,,,,,"Abdrakhmatov, K.Y., Aldazhanov, S.A., Hager, B.H., Relatively recent construction of the Tien Shan inferred from GPS measurements of present-day crustal deformation rates (1996) Nature, 384, pp. 450-453; Allen, M.B., Windley, B.F., Zhang, C., Guo, J.H., Evolution of the Turfan Basin, Chinese Central Asia (1993) Tectonics, 12, pp. 889-896; Avouac, J.P., Tapponnier, P., Bai, M., Active thrusting and folding along the northern TianShan and late Cenozoic rotation of the Tarim relative to Dzungaria and Kazakhstan (1993) Journal of Geophysical Research, 98, pp. 6755-6804; Cerling, T., Quade, J., Stable Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes in Soil Carbonates (1993) American Geophysical Union Monograph, 78, pp. 217-231. , Swart P et al, eds, Continental indicators of climate, Proceedings of Chapman Conference, Jackson Hole, Wyomin; Cerling, T., The stable isotopic composition of mordern soil carbonate and its relationship to climate (1984) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 71, pp. 229-240; Cerling, T., Hay, R., An isotopic study of paleosol carbonates from Olduvai Gorge (1986) Quaternary Research, 25, pp. 63-78; Cerling, T., Harris, J., MacFadden, B., Global vegetation change through the Miocene/Pliocene boundary (1997) Nature, 389 (6647), pp. 153-158; Charreau, J., Chen, Y., Gilder, S., Magnetostratigraphy and rock magnetism of the Neogene Kuitun He section (northwest China): Implications for Late Cenozoic uplift of the Tianshan mountains (2005) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 230, pp. 177-192; Charreau, J., Gilder, S., Chen, Y., Magnetostratigraphy of the Yaha section, Tarim Basin (China): 11Ma acceleration in erosion and uplift of the Tian Shan mountains (2006) Geology, 34, pp. 181-184; Chamberlain, C., Poage, M., Reconstructing the paleotopography of mountain belts from the isotopic composition of authigenic minerals (2000) Geology, 28, pp. 115-118; Clark, I., Fritz, P., (1997) Environmental isotopes in hydrology, pp. 63-78. , Boca Raton, Florida, Lewis Publishers; Dettman, D., Fang, X., Garzione, C., Li, J., (2003) Uplift-driven climate change at 12 Ma: A long delta O-18 record from the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau: Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 214, pp. 267-277; Dworkin, S., Nordt, L., Atchley, Determing terrestrial paleotemperatures using the oxygen isotope composition of pedogenic carbonate (2005) Earth Planetary Science Letters, 237, pp. 56-68; Fricke, H., O'Neil, J., The correlation between 18O/16O ratios of metoric water and surface temperature: Its use in investigating terrestrial climate change over geologic time (1999) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 170, pp. 181-196; Friedman I and O'Neil J. 1977.
