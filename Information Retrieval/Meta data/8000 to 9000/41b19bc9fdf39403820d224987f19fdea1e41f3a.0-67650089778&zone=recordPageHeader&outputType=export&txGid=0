The interpretation resulted in recognition of several changes in nine identified geomorphological land types: beach and coastal flat, coastal dunes, agricultural deltaic land, sabkhas, fish farms, Manzala lagoon, saltpans, marshes and urban centers. Reclamation of vast areas of the coastal dunes and of Manzala lagoon added about 420 km2 to the agricultural deltaic land. About 48 km2 of backshore flats, marshes, salt pans and Manzala lagoon have been converted to productive fish farms. The main urban centers have expanded; nearly 12.1 km2 have been added to their areas, and new urban centers (Damietta harbor and the New Damietta city) with total area reach of ∼35.3 km2 have been constructed at the expense of vast areas of Manzala lagoon, coastal dunes, and backshore flats. As a consequence of human activities, the size of Manzala lagoon has been reduced to more than 65%. Shoreline changes have been determined from beach profile survey (1990-2000), and comparison of 1955 aerial photographs and ETM satellite image of 2002 reveal alongshore patterns of erosion versus accretion. The short-term rate of shoreline retreat (1990-2000) has increased in the downdrift side of Damietta harbor (≲14 m/year), whereas areas of accretion exist within the embayment of Gamasa and in the shadow of Ras El Bar detached breakwaters system, with a maximum shoreline advance of ∼15 m/year. A sandy spit, 12 km long, has developed southeast of Damietta promontory. These erosion/accretion patterns denote the natural processes of wave-induced longshore currents and sediment transport, in addition, the impact of man-made coastal protection structures. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Anthropogenic influences; Coastal dunes; Damietta; Manzala lagoon; Nile Delta","Anthropogenic influences; Coastal dunes; Damietta; Manzala lagoon; Nile Delta; Aerial photography; Beaches; Coastal zones; Erosion; Global warming; Land reclamation; Photographic equipment; Remote sensing; Sea level; Sediment transport; Shore protection; Wetlands; Lakes; accretion; aerial photography; anthropogenic effect; coastal erosion; coastal protection; dune; global warming; marsh; sea level change; sediment transport; thematic mapping; Africa; Egypt; Nile Delta; North Africa",,,,,,"Abdel-Daiem, A.A., Morphological and hydrochemical characteristics of Bardawil lagoon in comparison with that of Manzala lagoon, Northern Egypt (2000) J Environ Sci, El Mansoura University, 20, pp. 177-187. , Egypt; Arbouille, D., Stanley, D.J., Late Quaternary evolution of the Burullus lagoon region, north-central Nile delta, Egypt (1991) Mar Geol, 99, pp. 45-66; Coleman, J.M., Robert, H.H., Murray, S.P., Salama, M., Morphology and dynamic sedimentology of the eastern Nile delta shelf (1981) Mar Geol, 42, pp. 301-312; El Banna, M.M., Damietta sand spit, Nile delta, Egypt (2004) Egypt Sedimentol, 12, pp. 269-282; El Banna, M.M., Nature and human impact on Nile delta coastal sand dunes, Egypt (2004) Environ Geol, 45, pp. 381-390; El Fishawi, N.M., Fanos, A.M., Prediction of sea level rise by 2100, Nile Delta coast (1989) INQUA Comm Quat Shořel Newsl, 11, pp. 43-47; El Raey, M., Dewidar, K., El Hattab, M., Adaptation to the impact of sea level rise in Egypt (1999) J Climate Res, 12, pp. 117-128; Fanos, A.M., Statistical analysis of longshore current data along the Nile delta coast (1986) J Water Sci Cairo, 1, pp. 45-55; Fanos, A.M., Frihy, O.E., Khafagy, A.A., Komar, P.D., Processes of shoreline change along the Nile Delta coast of Egypt (1991) Coastal Sediments'9.1 Conference, 2, pp. 1547-1557. , Seattle, WA; Fanos AM, Naffaa MG, Fouad EE, Omar W (1995) Seasonally and yearly wave regime and climate of the Mediterranean coast of Egypt.
