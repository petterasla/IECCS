Soil samples were taken along three transects marked between sea shore and Ecology Glacier, Baranowski Glacier and Windy Glacier and assigned to four age-class intervals: 0-7, >7- 29, >29-52 and >52 years after the retreat of the glaciers. Changes in nematode communities, in terms of abundance, diversity and trophic structure were related to the duration of the ice-free period. The abundance of nematodes increased with the age of ice-free areas. The highest numbers of nematodes were found on the sites free of ice for more than 52 years. Taxonomic and trophic diversity of nematodes on these sites was also significantly higher in comparison to the rest sites. Nematode communities on the sites from the first three age-class intervals were poor in genera (up to 6 genera) while on the oldest sites in total 16 genera of nematodes were found. A trend of increasing the number of nematode trophic groups along the age classes was also apparent - from community of nematodes belonging to only two trophic groups (bacterial and fungal feeders) on younger ice-free sites to more complex community of nematodes (belonging to five trophic groups), at the oldest sites.","Glacier melting; Global climate change; Soil nematodes","abundance; age class; climate change; glacial hydrology; melting; nematode; protected area; soil fauna; species diversity; trophic structure; Bacteria (microorganisms); Nematoda",,,,,,"Andrássy, I., (1998) Nematodes in the sixth continent - J.
