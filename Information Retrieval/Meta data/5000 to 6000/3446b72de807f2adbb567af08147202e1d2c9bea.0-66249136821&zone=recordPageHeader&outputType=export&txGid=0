Changes in the diets of Caribou followed the same trends as vegetative changes documented in long-term studies in northwestern Alaska. Lichens were significantly less prevalent on the landscape and in the winter diets of Caribou between 1995/1996 and 2005, while graminoids (grasses and sedges) were significantly more prevalent. Dramatic changes are forecasted for Arctic ecosystems under global warming scenarios which may continue the trend of declining lichens in northwestern Alaska and in the diet of Western Arctic Herd Caribou. The question of whether or not the altered diet will affect the population dynamics of this herd remains unresolved.","Caribou; Climate change; Diet; Fecal analysis; Habitat; Rangifer tarandus; Western Arctic Herd","arctic environment; climate effect; comparative study; decadal variation; deer; diet; dietary shift; ecosystem response; feces; grass; lichen; overwintering; population dynamics; sedge; tundra; vegetation dynamics; Arctic; Carex; Poaceae; Rangifer tarandus",,,,,,"Adamczewski, J.Z., Gates, C.C., Soutar, B.M., Hudson, R.J., Limiting effects of snow on seasonal habitat use and diets of caribou (Rangifer groenlandicus) on Coats Island, Northwest Territories, Canada (1988) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 66, pp. 1986-1996; Arsenault, D., Villeneuve, N., Boismenu, C., Leblanc, Y., Deshaye, J., Estimating lichen biomass and caribou grazing on the wintering grounds of northern Quebec: An application of fire history and Landsat data (1997) Journal of Applied Ecology, 34, pp. 65-78; Ballard, W.B., Ayres, L.A., Krausman, P.R., Reed, D.J., Fancy, S.G., 1997.
