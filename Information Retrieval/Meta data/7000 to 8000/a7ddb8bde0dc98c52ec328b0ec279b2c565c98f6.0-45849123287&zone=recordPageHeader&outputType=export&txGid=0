Aim: The study tested hypotheses about the association between the level and variability of rain and temperature early in life on the height of children and adolescents in a foraging-farming society of native Amazonians in Bolivia (Tsimane'). Subject and methods: Measurements were taken for 525 children aged 2-12 and 218 adolescents aged 13-23 in 13 villages in 2005. Log of standing height was regressed on mean annual level and mean intra-annual monthly coefficient of variation (CV) of rain and mean annual level of temperature during gestation, birth year, and ages 2-4. Controls include age, quinquennium and season of birth, parent's attributes, and dummy variables for surveyors and villages. Results: Climate variables were only related with the height of boys age 2-12. The level and CV of rain during birth year and the CV of rain and level of temperature during ages 2-4 were associated with taller stature. There were no secular changes in temperature (1973-2005) or rain (1943-2005). Conclusion: The height of young females and males is well protected from climate events, but protection works less well for boys ages 2-12. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.","Bolivia; Rain; Temperature; Tsimane'; Weather variability","rain; adolescence; child; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; global climate; health impact; height; hypothesis testing; rainfall; regression analysis; temperature anomaly; adolescent; adult; age; American Indian; article; body height; Bolivia; child; cross-sectional study; educational status; ethnology; female; human; male; parent; physiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; puberty; season; temperature; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Body Height; Bolivia; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Parents; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Puberty; Rain; Seasons; Temperature; Bolivia; South America",,,,,,"Alderman, H., Hoddinott, J., Kinsey, B., Long-term consequences of early childhood malnutrition (2006) Ox Econ Papers, 58, pp. 450-474; Barker, D.J.P., Erikson, J.G., Forsen, T., Osmond, C., Fetal origins of adult disease: Strength of effects and biological basis (2002) Int J Epid, 31, pp. 1235-1239; Behrman, J.R., Rosenzweig, M.R., Returns to birth weight (2004) Rev Econ Stat, 119, pp. 249-275; Global climate change and children's health (2007) Pediatrics, 120, pp. 1149-1152. , CEH Committee on Environmental Health; Cole, T.J., Secular trends in growth (2000) Proc Nutr Soc, 59, pp. 317-324; Cruickshank, J.K., Mzayek, F., Liu, L., Kieltyka, L., Sherwin, R., Webber, L.S., Srinavasan, S.R., Berenson, G.S., Origins of the black/white difference in blood pressure (2005) Circulation, 111, pp. 1932-1937; Doblhammer, G., Vaupel, J.W., Lifespan depends on month of birth (2001) PNAS, 98, pp. 2934-2939; Ellison, P.T., (2001) On fertile ground, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Epstein, P.R., Climate change and human health (2005) N Engl J Med, 353, pp. 1433-1436; Foster, Z., Byron, E., Reyes-Garcia, V., Huanca, T., Vadez, V., Apaza, L., Pérez, E., Sandstrom, B., Physical growth and nutritional status of Tsimane' Amerindian children (2005) Am J Phys Anthropol, 126, pp. 343-351; Frich, P., Alexander, L.V., Della-Marta, P., Observed coherent changes in climatic extremes during the second half of the twentieth century (2002) Clim Res, 19, pp. 193-212; Godoy, R., Reyes-Garcia, V., Vadez, V., Leonard, W.R., Huanca, T.L., Bauchet, J., Human capital, wealth, and nutrition in the Bolivian Amazon (2005) Econ Hum Biol, 3, pp. 139-162; Godoy, R.A., Goodman, E., Levins, R., Leonard, W.R., Anthropometric variability in the USA: 1971-2002 (2005) Ann Hum Biol, 32, pp. 469-486; Godoy, R., Leonard, W.R., Reyes-García, V., Physical stature of adult Tsimane' Amerindians, Bolivian Amazon in the 20th century (2006) Econ Hum Biol, 4, pp. 184-205; Godoy, R.A., García, R., Vadez, V., Leonard, W.R., Byron, E., How well do foragers protect food consumption?
