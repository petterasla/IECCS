What enables blackgum to grow nearly everywhere, but almost always at very low densities? It is the longest-lived hardwood species in the eastern United States, with a maximum age that can exceed 650 years. It is inherently slow growing, which most likely explains its great longevity and high shade tolerance; it is also one of the few tree species that are fire resistant as well as shade tolerant. Blackgum can grow in bottomlands or at xeric sites, being tolerant of both flooding and drought. Despite these ecologically beneficial attributes-and the fact that early loggers systematically avoided blackgum because of its tendency to rot-this slow-growing tree is rarely dominant. Blackgum has so far simply persisted as a marginal species. The future of blackgum is uncertain, however, because of the opposing forces of global warming and increased competition from other tree species. This ankle synthesizes a broad range of ecological studies that relate to the unique behavior of blackgum as a consummate subordinate, something that is poorly understood for this and other similar species in the ecology literature. © 2007 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Ecophysiology; Forest geography; Land-use history; Nyssa sylvatica; Witness trees","Nyssa sylvatica; Nyssaceae",,,,,,"Abrams, M.D., The red maple paradox (1998) BioScience, 48, pp. 355-364; Abrams, M.D., Black, B.A., Dendroecological analysis of a mature loblolly pine-mixed hardwood forest at the George Washington Birthplace National Monument, eastern Virginia (2000) Journal of the Torrey Botanical, 127, pp. 139-148. , Club; Abrams, M.D., McCay, D.M., Vegetation-site relationships of witness trees (1780-1856) in the presettlement forests of eastern West Virginia (1996) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 26, pp. 217-224; Abrams, M.D., Orwig, D.A., Structure, radial growth dynamics and recent climatic variations of a 320-year-old Pinus rigida rock outcrop community (1995) Oecologia, 101, pp. 353-360; Abrams, M.D., Ruffner, C.M., Physiographic analysis of witness-tree distribution (1765-1798) and present forest cover through north-central Pennsylvania (1995) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 25, pp. 659-668; Abrams, M.D., Orwig, D.A., DeMeo, T.E., Dendroecological analysis of successional dynamics for a presettlement-origin white pine-mixed oak forest in the southern Appalachians, USA (1995) Journal of Ecology, 83, pp. 123-133; Abrams, M.D., Copenheaver, C.A., Black, B.A., van de Gevel, S., Dendroecology and climate impacts for a relict old-growth, bog forest in the Ridge and Valley Province of central Pennsylvania, USA (2001) Canadian Journal of Botany, 79, pp. 58-69; Auge, R.M., Moore, J.L., Stomatal response to non-hydraulic root-to-shoot communication of partial soil drying in relation to foliar dehydration tolerance (2002) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 47, pp. 217-229; Barnes BV. 1991.
