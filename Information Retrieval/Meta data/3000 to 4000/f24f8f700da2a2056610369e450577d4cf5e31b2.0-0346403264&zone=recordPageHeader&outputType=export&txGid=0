The vulnerability of the maize and sorghum crops to climate change were studied using crop simulation models while climate change scenarios were generated from Global Circulation Models. Simulated yields indicated that rain-fed crop production under the observed climate was a small fraction of what could be produced under optimal conditions. The gap was attributed to both physical (especially lack of rain) and socio-economic constraints. Using the southern African core climate change scenario, simulated yields declined by 36% in the case of maize and 31% for sorghum in the sand veldt region. Yield reductions from the hard veldt region were in the order of 10% for both maize and sorghum. The growing season became shorter, the average reduction in days in the sand veldt region being 5 and 8 days for maize and sorghum respectively, and correspondingly, 3 and 4 days over the hard veldt region. The food security option currently followed in Botswana was found to be a good adaptive strategy under a changed climate.",,"Computer simulation; Crops; Economic and social effects; Food products; Mathematical models; Rain; Sensitivity analysis; Strategic planning; Climatic conditions; Food security; Climate change; climate change; crop yield; global warming; maize; sensitivity analysis; sorghum; Africa; Botswana; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays",,,,,,"Adams, R.M., Rosenzweig, C., Peart, R.M., Ritchie, J.T., McCarl, B.A., Glyer, J.D., Curry, R.B., Aleen Jr., L.H., Global Climate Change and U.S. Agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-223; Adringa, J., (1986) Solar Radiation in Botswana, 18p. , University of Botswana; Alexandrov, V.A., Hoogenboom, G., The Impact of Climate Variability and Change on Crop Yield in Bulgaria (2000) Agric.
