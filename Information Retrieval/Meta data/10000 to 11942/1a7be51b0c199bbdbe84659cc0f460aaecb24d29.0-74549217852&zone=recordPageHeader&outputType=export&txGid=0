To date, however, few studies have assessed the effects of such processes at the limits of species' distribution ranges. In this study, we have examined the potential for hybridization between range-edge populations of the wintergreen Pyrola minor and sympatric populations of Pyrola grandiflora. Location Qeqertarsuaq, Greenland and Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Methods Genetic analysis of samples from Greenland and Canada was carried out using a combination of nuclear and chloroplast single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results Analysis of nuclear SNPs confirmed hybridization in populations of morphologically intermediate individuals, as well as revealing the existence of cryptic hybrids in ostensibly morphologically pure P. minor populations. Analysis of chloroplast SNPs revealed that this hybridization is unidirectional and suggests that hybrids originate via pollen swamping of P. minor by the more common P. grandiflora. Main conclusions Extensive unidirectional hybridization may lead to the extinction of peripheral populations of P. minor where the two species grow sympatrically. Extinction could occur as a result of genetic assimilation where F1s are fertile, or via the removal of unidirectionally pollinated sterile F1s, or by a combination of these processes. This could compromise the ability of species to respond to climate change via habitat tracking, although the final outcome of these processes may ultimately depend on the rate of global climate change and its effect on the species' distributions. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Genetic assimilation; Hybridization; Introgression; Pyrola grandiflora; Pyrola minor; Range-edge","chloroplast; climate change; dicotyledon; evolutionary biology; extinction; genetic analysis; geographical distribution; habitat structure; hybridization; introgression; morphology; polymorphism; range size; rare species; Arctic; Canada; Churchill; Disko Island; Greenland; Manitoba; Ericaceae; Pyrola grandiflora; Pyrola minor",,,,,,"Allendorf, F.W., Leary, R.F., Spruell, P., Wenburg, J.K., The problem with hybrids: Setting conservation guidelines (2001) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 16, pp. 613-622; Anderson, E., Stebbins Jr., G.L., Hybridization as an evolutionary stimulus (1954) Evolution, 8, pp. 377-388; Anderson, E.C., Thompson, E.A., A model-based method for identifying species hybrids using multilocus genetic data (2002) Genetics, 160, pp. 1217-1229; Barton, N.H., The role of hybridization in evolution (2001) Molecular Ecology, 10, pp. 551-568; Beatty, G.E., McEvoy, P.M., Sweeney, O., Provan, J., Range-edge effects promote clonal growth in peripheral populations of the one-sided wintergreen (Orthilia secunda) (2008) Diversity and Distributions, 14, pp. 546-555; Berthier, P., Excoffier, L., Ruedi, M., Recurrent replacement of mtDNA and cryptic hybridization between two sibling bat species Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 3101-3109; Böcher, T.W., Studies in Pyrolaceae- two interesting wintergreens from West Greenland (1961) Botanisk Tidsskrift, 57, pp. 28-37; Boecklen, W.J., Howard, D.J., Genetic analysis of hybrid zones: Numbers of markers and power of resolution (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 2611-2616; Brock, M.T., The potential for genetic assimilation of a native dandelion species, Taraxicum ceratophorum (Asteraceae), by the exotic congener T. officinale (2004) American Journal of Botany, 91, pp. 656-663; Brown, J.H., On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species (1984) The American Naturalist, 124, pp. 255-279; Brumfield, R.T., Beerli, P., Nickerson, D.A., Edwards, S.V., The utility of single nucleotide polymorphisms in inferences of population history (2003) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 18, pp. 249-256; Chan, C., Ballantyne, K.N., Aikman, H., Fastier, D., Daugherty, C.H., Chambers, G.K., Genetic analysis of interspecific hybridization in the world's only Forbes' parakeet (Cyanoramphus forbesi) natural population (2006) Conservation Genetics, 7, pp. 493-506; Darwin, C.R., (1859) On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life., , John Murray.
