There is general agreement in the literature that the frequency of extreme precipitation events in Southeast Asia will increase with global warming. In particular, the potential impact of associated storm hazards will render the densely populated countries in Southeast Asia vulnerable to such changes in precipitation events. One main adaptation strategy given such impending changes is preparedness. Using existing literature and historical meteorological data, this paper establishes that Southeast Asia is indeed experiencing storms of higher intensities and more frequently. Two case of extreme storm event in Southeast Asia, the extreme high rainfall event in December 2006 in Southern Johor and Typhoon Vamei, are presented to consider the implications of the increased storm activities due to global warming. These two examples also discuss the need for preparedness in adapting to the impact of global warming. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Global warming; Southeast Asia; Storm preparedness; Storms","adaptive management; climate effect; disaster management; extreme event; global warming; hazard assessment; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; storm; Southeast Asia",,,,,,"Aldrian, E., Djamil, Y.S., Spatio-temporal climatic change of rainfall in East Java Indonesia (2008) Int J Climatol, 28, pp. 435-448. , 10.1002/joc.1543; Bhaskaran, B., Mitchell, J.F.B., Simulated changes in Southeast Asian Monsoon precipitation resulting from anthropogenic emissions (1998) Int J Climatol, 18, pp. 1455-1462; Brahic, C., Climate change may boost monsoon and worsen droughts (2007) New Scientist Environment, , http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn10978, Available via, Accessed 20 March 2008; (2008) Aid call as Burma casualties rise, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7384858.stm, British Broadcasting Corporation, Available via BBC News, Accessed 7 May 2008; Brooks, N., (2003) Vulnerability, risk and adaptation: A conceptual framework, , Tyndall Centre, Working Paper 38; Brooks, N., Adger, W.N., Kelly, P.M., The determinants of vulnerability and adaptive capacity at the national level and the implications for adaptation (2005) Glob Environ Change, 15 (2), pp. 151-163; Chang, C.P., Ching, H.L., Kuo, H.C., Typhoon Vamei: an equatorial tropical cyclone formation (2003) Geophysical Reserach letters, , http://www.weather.nps.navy.mil/cpchang/papers-pdf/vamei.pdf, Available via, Accessed 20 Dec 2005; (2008) Myanmar claims warning issued ahead of cyclone, , http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/346189/1/.html, Channel NewsAsia, Available via Channel NewsAsia. com, Accessed 8 May 2008; Chatterjea, K., Severe wet spells and vulnerability of urban slopes: case of Singapore (2008) Nat Hazards, , doi: 10. 1007/s11069-009-9362-7; Chen, T.S., Yen, M.C., Weng, S.P., Interaction between the summer monsoons in East Asia and the South China Sea: intraseasonal monsoon modes (2000) J Atmos Sci, 57 (9), pp. 1373-1392; Cruz, R.V., Harasawa, H., Lai, M., Wu, S., Asia.
