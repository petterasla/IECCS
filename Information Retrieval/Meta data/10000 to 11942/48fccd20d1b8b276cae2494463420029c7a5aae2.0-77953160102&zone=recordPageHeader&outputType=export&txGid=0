Episodic outbreaks are a common occurrence in the beetles' primary host, lodgepole pine. Current outbreaks, however, are occurring in habitats where outbreaks either did not previously occur or were limited in scale. Herein, we address widespread, ongoing outbreaks in high-elevation, whitebark pine forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where, due to an inhospitable climate, past outbreaks were infrequent and short lived. We address the basic question: are these outbreaks truly unprecedented and a threat to ecosystem continuity? In order to evaluate this question we (1) present evidence that the current outbreak is outside the historic range of variability; (2) examine system resiliency to MPB disturbance based on adaptation to disturbance and host defenses to MPB attack; and (3) investigate the potential domain of attraction to large-scale MPB disturbance based on thermal developmental thresholds, spatial structure of forest types, and the confounding influence of an introduced pathogen. We conclude that the loss of dominant whitebark pine forests, and the ecological services they provide, is likely under continuing climate warming and that new research and strategies are needed to respond to the crisis facing whitebark pine. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate change; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Disturbance ecology; Ecological resiliency; Global warming; Greater yellowstone ecosystem; Historic range of variability; Lodgepole pine; Mountain ecology; Mountain pine beetle; Pinus albacaulis; Whitebark pine","beetle; climate change; ecosystem resilience; environmental disturbance; evergreen tree; population outbreak; vulnerability; animal; article; beetle; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; physiology; pine; United States; Animals; Beetles; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Northwestern United States; Pinus; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; United States; Coleoptera; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Hexapoda; Pinus albicaulis; Pinus contorta; Pinus mugo",,,,,,"Amman, G.D., Population changes of the mountain pine beetle in relation to elevation (1973) Environmental.
