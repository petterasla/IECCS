This article presents a quantitative eco-efficiency (E/E) analysis on MSW management in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. A methodology for E/E analysis has been proposed, with an emphasis on the consistent integration of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). The environmental and economic impacts derived from LCA and LCC have been normalized and defined as a quantitative E/E indicator. The proposed method was applied in a case study of Tianjin, China. The study assessed the current MSW management system, as well as a set of alternative scenarios, to investigate trade-offs between economy and GHG emissions mitigation. Additionally, contribution analysis was conducted on both LCA and LCC to identify key issues driving environmental and economic impacts. The results show that the current Tianjin's MSW management system emits the highest GHG and costs the least, whereas the situation reverses in the integrated scenario. The key issues identified by the contribution analysis show no linear relationship between the global warming impact and the cost impact in MSW management system. The landfill gas utilization scenario is indicated as a potential optimum scenario by the proposed E/E analysis, given the characteristics of MSW, technology levels, and chosen methodologies. The E/E analysis provides an attractive direction towards sustainable waste management, though some questions with respect to uncertainty need to be discussed further. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Contribution analysis; Cost impact; Eco-efficiency; Environmental and economic impacts; GHG emission; Global warming impact; Key issues; Landfill gas; Life-cycle assessments; Life-cycle costing; Limited capacity; Linear relationships; Management systems; Sustainable waste management; Tianjin; Tianjin , China; Civil aviation; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Uncertainty analysis; Waste treatment; Municipal solid waste; economic impact; environmental impact; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; waste management; waste treatment; article; carbon footprint; case study; China; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; ecosystem; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; quantitative analysis; solid waste management; sustainable development; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; China; Tianjin",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Gases",,,,"Arena, U., Mastellone, M.L., Perugini, F., Life cycle assessment of a plastic packaging recycling system (2003) Int.
