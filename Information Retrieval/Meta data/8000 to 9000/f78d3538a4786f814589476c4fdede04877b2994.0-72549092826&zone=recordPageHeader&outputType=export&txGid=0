For average European waste composition most waste management scenarios provided negative global warming factors and hence overall savings in greenhouse gas emissions: Scenarios with landfilling saved 0ĝ€"" 400, scenarios with incineration saved 200ĝ€""700, and scenarios with mechanical-biological treatment saved 200ĝ€"" 750 kg CO 2-eq. tonneĝ€"" 1 municipal waste depending on recycling scheme and energy recovery. Key parameters were the amount of paper recycled (it was assumed that wood made excessive by paper recycling substituted for fossil fuel), the crediting of the waste management system for the amount of energy recovered (hard-coal-based energy was substituted), and binding of biogenic carbon in landfills. Most other processes were of less importance. Rational waste management can provide significant savings in society""s emission of greenhouse gas depending on waste composition and efficient utilization of the energy recovered.","Environmental performance; Europe; Global warming factors; Greenhouse gas savings; Waste management","Biological waste treatment; Energy recovery; Environmental performance; Key parameters; Landfilling; Management scenarios; Mechanical-biological treatment; Municipal waste; Organics; Paper recycling; Recycling systems; Residual wastes; Waste composition; Waste management systems; Biochemical engineering; Carbon monoxide; Energy conversion; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Industrial waste treatment; Leakage (fluid); Metal recovery; Recycling; Waste incineration; Waste management; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; biogenic emission; carbon dioxide; global warming; greenhouse gas; incineration; landfill; recycling; waste management; anaerobic digestion; article; climate change; combustion; composting; controlled study; electricity; energy consumption; energy recovery; environmental parameters; global warming factors; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; priority journal; recycling; waste management; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Global Warming; Incineration; Models, Theoretical; Waste Management; Waste Products; Europe",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Waste Products",,,,"Astrup, T., Fruergaard, T., Christensen, T.H., (2009a) Recycling of plastic: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 763-772; Astrup, T., Mã̧ller, J., Fruergaard, T., (2009b) Incineration and co-combustion of waste: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 789-799; Beigl, P., Lebersorger, S., Salhofer, S., Modelling municipal solid waste generation: A review (2008) Waste Management, 28 (1), pp. 200-214. , DOI 10.1016/j.wasman.2006.12.011, PII S0956053X07000153; Boldrin, A., Andersen, J.K., Mã̧ller, L., Favoino, E., Christensen, T.H., (2009) Composting and compost utilization: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 800-812; Christensen, T.H., Bhander, G.S., Lindvall, H., Larsen, A.W., Fruergaard, T., Damgaard, A., Manfredi, S., Hauschild, M.Z., Experience with the use of LCA-modelling (EASEWASTE) in waste management (2007) Waste Management & Research, 25, pp. 257-262; Christensen, T.H., Gentil, E.C., Boldrin, A., Larsen, A.W., Weidema, B.P., Hauschild, M.Z., (2009) C balance, carbon dioxide emissions and global warming potentials in LCA-modelling of waste management systems Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 707-715; Damgaard, A., Larsen, A.W., Christensen, T.H., (2009) Recycling of metals: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 773-780; Dones, R., Heck, T., Hirschberg, S., Greenhouse gas emissions from energy systems, comparison and overview (2004) Encyclopedia of Energy, 3, pp. 77-95. , Academic Press/ Elsevier, San Diego, CA, USA; Eisted, R., Larsen, A.W., Christensen, T.H., (2009) Collection, transfer and transport of waste: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contribution Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 738-745; (2007) Protocol for the Quantification of Greenhouse Gases Emissions from Waste Management Activities.
