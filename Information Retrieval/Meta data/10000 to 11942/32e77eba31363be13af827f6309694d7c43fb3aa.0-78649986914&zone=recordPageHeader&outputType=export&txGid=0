Wind turbines are one of the most promising sources of renewable energy in Taiwan. However, on September 28, 2008, Typhoon Jangmi struck Taiwan, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall that collapsed a wind turbine tower located on the shore of Taichung Harbor. This study provides significant insights into, and lessons learned from, post-disaster inspection into the causes of tower failure during this typhoon. This event represented the first time that a wind turbine in Taiwan that had to be reconstructed after collapsing. To prevent similar accidents, the likely causal mechanisms are examined from the risk management perspective. Data for case analysis are collected from original tower design reports, the tower design code, construction records and documents, historical wind-speed data, structural tower analysis, and intact and fractured bolt material tests. Furthermore, similar accidents in other countries and their causes are reviewed to identify potential risk factors affecting the lifecycle of wind turbines. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Failure analysis; Natural disaster; Risk management; Structural failure; Wind turbine","Bolt materials; Case analysis; Energy supplies; Heavy rainfall; Large wind turbines; Natural disasters; Potential risks; Renewable energies; Strong winds; Structural failure; Tower design; Tower failure; Wind turbine towers; Accidents; Data handling; Disasters; Failure (mechanical); Failure analysis; Fracture mechanics; Global warming; Hurricanes; Quality assurance; Rain; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Structural analysis; Structural integrity; Towers; Wind turbines; Wind power",,,,,,"Chen, D.-H., Harris, P., Scullion, T., Bilyeu, J., Forensic investigation of a sulfate-heaved project in Texas (2005) J Perform Constr Facil, 19 (4), pp. 324-330; Noon, R.K., (2000) Forensic engineering investigation, , CRC, Hiawatha; Alec, S., Zimmer, G.R.B., (2006), pp. 97-111. , John Hancock Center Scaffold Collapse.
