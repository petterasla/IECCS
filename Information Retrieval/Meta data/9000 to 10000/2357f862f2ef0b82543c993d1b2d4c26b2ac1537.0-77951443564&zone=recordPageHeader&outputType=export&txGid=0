In this study, temporal changes in the time of spring fruiting in Norway and the UK during 1960-2007 have been investigated by statistical analyses of about 6000 herbarium and field records, covering 34 species. Nearly 30 per cent of the temporal variation in fruiting could be ascribed to spatial and species-specific effects. Correcting for these effects, linear trends towards progressively earlier fruiting were detected during the entire period in both Norway and the UK, with a change in average fruiting day of 18 days over the study period. Early fruiting was correlated with high winter temperatures in both countries, indicating that the observed phenological changes are likely due to earlier onset of spring. There were also significant correlations between climatic conditions in one year and timing of fruiting the following year, indicating that below-ground mycelia are influenced by climatic conditions over a longer time period before fruiting. Fruiting dates were, however, not strictly related to changes in vernal accumulated thermal time. Our results indicate that global warming has lead to progressively earlier fruiting of spring fungi in northwest Europe during the last half century. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Fruit bodies; Phenology; Spring fungi; Thermal time","adaptation; climate change; fruiting; fungus; macroecology; phenotypic plasticity; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; article; climate change; fungus; Norway; physiology; season; time; United Kingdom; Climate Change; Fungi; Great Britain; Norway; Seasons; Time Factors; Norway; United Kingdom; Fungi",,,,,,"Badeck, F.-W., Bondeau, A., Bottcher, K., Doktor, D., Lucht, W., Schaber, J., Sitch, S., Responses of spring phenology to climate change (2004) New Phytologist, 162 (2), pp. 295-309. , DOI 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01059.x; Chmielewski, M., Phenology and agriculture (2003) Tasks for Vegetation Science.
