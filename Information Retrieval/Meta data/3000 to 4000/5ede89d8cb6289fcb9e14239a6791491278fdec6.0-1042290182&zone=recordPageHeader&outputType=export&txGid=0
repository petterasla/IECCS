Predawn leaf nonstructural carbohydrate (soluble sugars and starch) content was significantly lower at the higher night temperatures. Photosynthetic capacity (Amax) during the day increased significantly between 15 and 25°C at 42 and 80 Pa, but not at 120 Pa. • These findings indicate that the previously determined relationships between elevated night-time temperature, dark respiration and increased photosynthetic capacity may also hold at elevated p(CO2)a. This response may have a significant influence on plant and ecosystem carbon exchange under global change scenarios.","Carbohydrate content; Elevated CO2; Global warming; Nocturnal warming; Photosynthesis; Populus deltoides (cottonwood); Respiration; Temperature","carbon dioxide enrichment; global warming; nocturnal activity; photosynthesis; respiration; temperature; Populus; Populus deltoides",,,,,,"Alward, R.D., Detling, J.K., Milchunas, D.G., Grassland vegetation changes and nocturnal global warming (1999) Science, 283, pp. 229-231; Amthor, J.S., Plant respiratory responses to elevated CO2 partial pressure (1997) Advances in Carbon Dioxide Effects Research, , Whitman CE, ed.
