One of the methodologies for solving this problem uses harmless energy resources. Ocean energy is one such energy resource. This reserch involves a study of the OC-OTEC system, which is one ocean thermal energy conversion technology. In this system, the steam that drives a turbine is generated from surface sea water in an evaporator and condenses in a condenser after passing through a turbine. However, the steam evaporation rate in an evaporator is affected by fluctuations in surface sea water temperature and ambient pressure. Therefore, it is necessary to define the dynamic characteristics of the evaporator in order to gain constant power output. This paper presents an analysis as to how the evaporation rate is affected when surface sea water temperature and ambient pressure change. Further ,we clarify that the dynamic characteristics of evaporator are more affected by fluctuation of the ambient pressure than fluctuation of surface sea water temperature.",,,,,,,,"Japanese sourceLorenz, J.J., Yung, D., Howard, P.A., Panchal, C.B., Poucher, F.W., OTEC-1 Heat Exchanger Results (1981) Proc. of 8th Ocean Energy Conference, 2, p. 977; (1993) Solar Energy Intelligence Report, 19 (8), p. 58; Japanese sourceJapanese sourceJapanese source",,,,,,,,,03669092,,DGSKA,,"Japanese","Denshi Gijutsu Sogo Kenkyusho Iho",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-4243195033
