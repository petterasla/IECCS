The number of wintering species of birds was negatively correlated with the depth of snow and positively related to the number of species recorded during the previous count. The total number of birds was negatively correlated with the depth of snow cover and positively correlated with the total number of birds recorded during the previous count. To a great extent it was the presence of snow cover that shaped the assemblages of birds wintering in farmland. During long-lasting snow, birds may leave this type of landscape. At wintering grounds influenced by conditions similar to those in eastern Poland the depth of snow may be of greater importance for birds than the presence of suitable feeding habitats because food is limited. As a consequence of the global climate change, changes in snow cover will occur and should increase the numbers and abundance of bird species wintering in eastern Poland.",,"abundance; agricultural land; climate change; climate effect; feeding ground; food limitation; seasonality; snow cover; Poland; Aves",,,,,,"Ballester, J., Douville, H., Chauvin, F., Present-day climatology and projected changes of warm and cold days in the CNRM-CM3 global climate model (2009) Climate Dynamics, 32, pp. 35-54; Brittingham, M.C., Temple, S.A., Impacts of supplemental feeding on survival rates of black-capped chickadees (1998) Ecology, 69, pp. 581-589; Carey, C., The impacts of climate change on the annual cycles of birds (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 364, pp. 3321-3330; Dierschke, J., Bairlein, F., Habitat selection of wintering passerines in salt marshes of the German Wadden Sea (2004) Journal of Ornithology, 145, pp. 48-58; Dzierzanowski, T., Wintering of birds in the agricultural landscape near Tomaszów Mazowiecki in the season of 2003/2004 (2006) Kulon, 11, pp. 92-98. , In Polish with English summary; Field, R.H., Benke, S., Bádonyi, K., Bradbury, R.B., Influence of conservation tillage on winter bird use of arable fields in Hungary (2007) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 120, pp. 399-404; Fedrigo, A., Fornasari, L., Bonaventura, O., Vigorita, V., Massa, R., The winter bird species and their abundance in Lombardy, Northern Italy (1989) Annales Zoologici Fennici, 26, pp. 291-295; Galarza, A., Influence of temperature on the wintering avifauna of a northern Iberian coastal farmland (2000) Miscellanea Zoologica, 23, pp. 23-29; Gillings, S., Beaven, P., Wintering farmland birds: Results for mass-participation surveys (2004) British Birds, 97, pp. 118-129; Goławski, A., Kasprzykowski, Z., Birds wintering in the open agricultural landscape of eastern Poland (2008) Notatki Ornitologiczne, 49, pp. 152-161. , (In Polish with English summary); Górski, W., (1976) Acta Omithologica, 16, pp. 79-116. , Polish with English summary; Hake, M., Fattening strategies in dominance-structured greenfinch (Carduelis chloris) flocks in winter (1996) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 39, pp. 71-76; Hardi, M., Winter ecology of the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella in Switzerland (1989) Ornithologische Beobachter, 86, pp. 209-217. , In German with English summary; Jylhä, K., Fronzek, S., Tuomenvirta, H., Carter, T.R., Ruosteenoja, K., Based on climate model projections for Europe (2008) Climatic Change, 86, pp. 441-462; Kasprzykowski, Z., Goławski, A., Birds wintering in an open agricultural landscape of the Siedlce Upland in 2002/2003 (2003) Kulon, 8, pp. 21-25. , In Polish with English summary; Kozuchowski, K., Degirmendžić, J., Contemporary changes of climate in Poland: Trends and variation in thermal and solar conditions related to plant vegetation (2005) Polish Journal of Ecology, 53, pp. 283-297; Lack, P., The atlas of wintering birds in Britain and Ireland (1986) T & AD Poyser, , London; Lima, S.L., Initiation and termination of daily feeding in dark-eyed juncos: Influence of predation risk and energy reserves (1988) Oikos, 53, pp. 3-11; Mason, C.F., Macdonald, S.M., Winter bird numbers and land-use preferences in an arable landscape in eastern England (1999) Bird Conservation International, 9, pp. 119-127; Meijer, T., Rozman, J., Schulte, M., Stach-Dressmann, C., New findings in body mass regulation in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in response to photoperiod and temperature (1996) Journal of Zoology, 240, pp. 717-734. , London; Moorcroft, D., Whittingham, M.J., Bradbury, R.B., Wilson, J.D., The selection of stubble fields by wintering granivorous birds reflects vegetation cover and food abundance (2002) Journal of Applied Ecology, 39, pp. 535-547; Naef-Daenzer, L., Widmer, F., Nuber, M., Differential post-fledging survival of great and coal tits in relation to their condition and fledging date (2001) Journal of Animal Ecology, 70, pp. 730-738; Newton, I., (1998) Population Limitation in Birds, , Academic Press, London; Orłowski, G., Gȩbski, P., Effect of weather change on flock size of the Snow Bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis L.) wintering in south-western Poland (2007) Polish Journal of Ecology, 55, pp. 181-185; (2009) The State of Europe's Common Birds 2008.
