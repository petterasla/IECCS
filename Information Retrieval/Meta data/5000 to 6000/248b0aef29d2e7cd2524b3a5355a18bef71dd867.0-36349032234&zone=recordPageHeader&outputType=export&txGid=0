The sedimentary sequence recorded two dry episodes (3.7-2.4 ka and 1.2-0.8 ka ago) in the Holocene as shown by the presence of two layers of loess within the Holocene deposits. These two arid events are consistent with records of global climate change in the Holocene and also coincident with major historic events in China. This finding suggests that loess-paleosol sequences in China can record global climate changes and implies that rapid climate change affected the progress of human civilization. In addition, changes in the sedimentation rate through the section suggest that agricultural expansion may have accelerated the rate of dust accumulation. © 2007 SAGE Publications.","China; Holocene; Loess-palaeosol sequence; Optical dating; Rapid climate change","climate change; historical record; Holocene; loess; paleosol; sedimentary sequence; sedimentation rate; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi",,,,,,"Aitken, M.J., (1985) Thermoluminescence dating, , Academic Press, 359 pp; Almond, P., Up-building soil formation in loess in a high rainfall environment, Westland, New Zealand (1998) International symposium on dust aerosols, loess soil and global change.
