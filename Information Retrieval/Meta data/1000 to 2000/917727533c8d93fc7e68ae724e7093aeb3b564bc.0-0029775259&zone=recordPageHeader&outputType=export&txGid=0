Therefore, the positions of old shorelines (of the past 20,000 years or so) can be considered to indicate positions of actual past sea levels. Over 200 shoreline indicators at positions below as well as above present sea level have been radiocarbon dated. These dated positions indicate that prior to 6 ka the sea rose from at least 90 m below present sea level at rates that initially amounted to 15 mm/year and later became 6 mm/year. At ca. 6 ka, the rising sea surpassed its current position and at ca. 5 ka, it reached 5 m. During this maximum marine inundation, the peninsula was narrower, since the low coastal plains did not yet exist. In the period following this maximum transgression, the available shoreline data indicate that regional sea level subsided through a series of fluctuations that were characterized by amplitudes of 2 m and periods of about 2000 years. The peaks and troughs of the fluctuations became progressively lower. The latest peak was at about +1.7 m (or 0.7 m above present high tide) a few hundred years ago. The cause of these fluctuations is not yet known, but the trend suggests that, in the near future, regional sea level may subside at annual rates between 1.5 mm and 2 mm. This rate of descent is 25 to 30% of the estimated rate of sea-level rise that may result from global warming. In other words, for the Malay-Thai Peninsula, the effect of sea-level rise on account of manmade greenhouse gases will be partly compensated by actual subsidence of regional sea level.",,"global warming; radiocarbon dating; sea level change; sea level rise; shoreline indicator; shoreline position; Malaysia, Malay Peninsula; Thailand, Malay Peninsula; Thailand, Malay-Thai Peninsula",,,,,,"Anizan, I., Wind-stress features and their paleoenvironmental implication in the east coast of Johore (1989) Sains Malaysiana, (1), pp. 13-22; Chappell, J., Shackleton, N.J., Oxygen isotopes and sea level (1986) Nature, 342, pp. 137-140; Engkakul, V., Pramojanee, P., The correlation of Holocene sea level change along the east coast of Peninsular Thailand (1991) IGCP-296 Workshop on Quaternary of Asia and the Pacific, Phuket, Thailand, 20-21 October 1991, , 11 pp; Geyh, M.-A., Kudrass, H., Streif, H., Sea-level changes during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene in the Strait of Malacca (1979) Nature, 278, pp. 441-443; Jones, C.A.R., The Geology and Mineral Resources of Perlis, North Kedah and the Langkawi Islands (1978) Geological Survey of Malaysia, Memoir, 17. , 257 pp; Kamaludin, H., Yunus, A.R., Significance of Quaternary geology studies in the coastal areas (1991) Proceedings IEM/ICE Joint Conference on Coastal Engineering in National Development, Kuala Lumpur, March 1991, pp. B1-B30; Mazlan, M., Kamaludin, H., Quaternary deposits near Pantai Remis, NW Peninsular Malaysia, and significance of the Pleistocene-Holocene unconformity (1991) IGCP-296 Workshop on Quaternary of Asia and the Pacific, Phuket, Thailand, 20-21 October 1991, , 5 pp; Sinsakul, S., Evidence of sea-level changes in the coastal area of Thailand: A review (1990) CCOP-UNEP Workshop on Global Environmental Change, Chiengmai, Thailand, 2-7 July 1990, , 30 pp; Sinsakul, S., Sonsuk, M., Hastings, P.J., Holocene sea levels in Thailand: Evidence and basis for interpretation (1985) Journal of the Geological Society of Thailand, 8 (1-2), pp. 1-12; Tjia, H.D., Ancient shorelines in Peninsular Malaysia (1987) Spafa Final Report Seminar in Prehistory of Southeast Asia, Thailand, 15-25 January 1987, pp. 239-257; Tjia, H.D., Fujii, S., Late Quaternary shorelines in Peninsular Malaysia (1992) The Coastal Zone of Peninsular Malaysia, pp. 28-41. , Tjia, H.D. and Sharifah Mastura Syed Abdullah (eds).
