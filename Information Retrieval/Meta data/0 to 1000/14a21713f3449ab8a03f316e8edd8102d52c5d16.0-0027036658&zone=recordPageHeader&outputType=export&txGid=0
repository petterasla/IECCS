There is a growing number of 'guesstimates' (often called scenarios) about climate change impacts in sub-Saharan Africa. A review of the existing scenarios highlights conflicting, if not opposing, views about those impacts. Such scenarios must be used with caution and labelled as speculation. No single scenario should be used for determining irreversible policy responses to the potential regional consequences of global warming. © 1992.",,"climatic change; environmental change; global warming; man-environment relations; Africa, (sub-Sahara)",,,,,,"Gaile, Rose, Urbiztondo, Adjusting to global climate change in the Zambezi River Basin (1992) paper presented at Southern Africa Development Coordinating Committee (SADCC) Conference on Climate Change in Southern Africa, , Windhoek, Namibia; Stewart, Mumpower, Reagan-Cirincione, (1992) Scientists' Opinions about Global Climate Change: Summary of the Results of a Survey, , See, Center for Policy Research, Graduate School of Public Affairs, State University of New York, Albany, NY, A recent survey has reinforced the existence of such a distinction; Bundestag, Protecting the Earth: A Status Report with Recommendations for a New Energy Policy (1991) report of the Enquete Commission, 2, p. 126. , German Bundestag, Bonn; bundestag, (1989) Protecting the Earth's Atmosphere: An International Challenge, p. 454. , German Bundestag, Bonn, report of the Enquete Commission; bundestag, (1989) Protecting the Earth's Atmosphere: An International Challenge, p. 521. , German Bundestag, Bonn, report of the Enquete Commission; Timberlake, (1985) Africa in Crisis, , International Institute for Environment and Development, London; Foley, Exaggerating the Sahelian woodfuel problem?
