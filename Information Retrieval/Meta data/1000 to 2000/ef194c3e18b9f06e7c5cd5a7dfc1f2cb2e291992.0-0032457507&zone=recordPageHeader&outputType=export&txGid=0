Generally, fishes important in the recreational and commercial fisheries were smaller, and large changes occurred in relative abundance and species composition. Indicative of a warming trend, total species composition of fishes had become more tropical, and a tropical sponge previously unrecorded at this latitude off the North Carolina coast became common. Two new (to the area) families and 29 new species of tropical fishes were recorded. Observations of 28 species of tropical reef fishes increased significantly. No new temperate species were observed, and the most abundant temperate species decreased by a factor of 22. Mean monthly bottom water temperatures in winter were 1-6°C warmer during the recent study. An increase in fish-cleaning symbiosis was especially noticeable.",,"community structure; fishing industry; global warming; ichthyofauna; reef; Atlantic Ocean; United States",,,,,,"Anderson, G.R.V., The community structure of coral reef fishes (1981) American Naturalist, 117, pp. 476-495; Barnola, J.M., Raynaud, D., Korotkevich, Y.S., Lorius, C., Vostok ice core provides a 160,000 year record of atmospheric CO2 (1987) Nature, 329, pp. 408-414; Barry, J.P., Baxter, C.H., Sagarin, R.D., Gilman, S.E., Climate-related, long-term faunal changes in a California rocky intertidal community (1995) Science, 267, pp. 672-675; Beaumariage, D.S., (1969) Returns from the 1965 Schlitz Tagging Program Including a Cumulative Analysis of Previous Results, , Florida Department of Natural Resources, Technical Series 59, Tallahassee; Blanton, J.O., Exchange of Gulf Stream water with North Carolina shelf water in Onslow Bay during stratified conditions (1971) Deep-Sea Research, 18, pp. 167-178; Blanton, J.O., Pietrafesa, L.J., Flushing of the outer continental shelf south of Cape Hatteras by the Gulf Stream (1978) Geophysical Research Letters, 5, pp. 495-498; Brock, R.E., Lewis, C., Wass, R.C., Stability and structure of a fish community on a coral patch reef in Hawaii (1979) Marine Biology, 54, pp. 281-292; Colin, P.L., Weiler, D., Shapiro, D.Y., Aspects of the reproduction of two species of grouper, Epinephelus guttatus and E. striatus, in the West Indies (1987) Bulletin of Marine Science, 40, pp. 220-230; Dixon, R.L., Evidence for mesopelagic feeding by the vermilion snapper, Rhomboplites aurorubens (1975) Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Scientific Society, 91, pp. 240-242; Dixon, R.L., Huntsman, G.R., Estimating catches and fishing effort of the southeast United States headboat fleet, 1972-1982 NOAA Technical Report, , In press.
