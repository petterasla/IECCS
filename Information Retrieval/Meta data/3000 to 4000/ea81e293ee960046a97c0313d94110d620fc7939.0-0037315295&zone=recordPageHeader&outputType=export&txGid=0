Over this same period global temperatures increased by 0.45°C (± 0. 15°C). We analyzed the climatic causes and ecological consequences of glacier retreat by creating spatially explicit models of the creation and ablation of glaciers and of the response of vegetation to climate change. We determined the melt rate and spatial distribution of glaciers under two possible future climate scenarios, one based on carbon dioxide-induced global warming and the other on a linear temperature extrapolation. Under the former scenario, all glaciers in the basin will disappear by the year 2030, despite predicted increases in precipitation; under the latter, melting is slower. Using a second model, we analyzed vegetation responses to variations in soil moisture and increasing temperature in a complex alpine landscape and predicted where plant communities are likely to be located as conditions change.","Climate models; Glacier retreat; Vegetation response","Melampodium",,,,,,"Brathwaite, R.J., Olesen, O.B., Calculation of glacial ablation from air temperature, West Greenland (1989) Glacier Fluctuations and Climatic Change: Proceedings of the Symposium on Glacier Fluctuations and Climatic Change, pp. 219-233. , Oerlemans J, ed; Amsterdam 1987.
