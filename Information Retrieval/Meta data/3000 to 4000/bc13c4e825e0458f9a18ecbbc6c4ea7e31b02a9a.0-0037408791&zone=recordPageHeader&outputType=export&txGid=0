Fertil. Fact., Jinhua City, Zhejiang, China","The increasing anthropogenic CO2 emission and global warming (thus climate change) have challenged the United States and other countries to find new and better ways to meet the world's increasing needs for energy while reducing greenhouse gases emissions. Here, we present a practical and revolutionary method that can sequester greenhouse gas emissions and, at the same time, benefit both agriculture and the economy. The proposed strategy utilizes an innovative application of chemical processes to convert CO2, NOx and SOx emissions into valuable fertilizers (mainly, NH4HCO3) that can enhance sequestration of CO2 into soil and subsoil earth layers, reduce NO3 - contamination of groundwater and stimulate photosynthetic fixation of CO2 from the atmosphere. This invention integrates pollutant removing fertilizer production reactions with coal-fired power plants and other energy operations, resulting in a clean energy system that is in harmony with the earth ecosystem. This technology could contribute importantly to global CO2 sequestration and clean air protection. When this technology is in worldwide use, because of its high efficiency and carbon credit, in addition to the benefit of clean air protection and stimulation of photosynthetic fixation of CO2 from the atmosphere, maximally 300 million tons of CO2 per year (equivalent to about 5% of the CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants in the world) from smokestacks can be placed into soil by the use of this technology. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
