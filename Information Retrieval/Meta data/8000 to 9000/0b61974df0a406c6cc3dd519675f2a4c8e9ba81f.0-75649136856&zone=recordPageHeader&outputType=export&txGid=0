This article specifically looks at the utilization of industrial by-products (IBPs) (coal ash, foundry sand, and foundry slag) as aggregate for roadway sub-base construction for the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, urban region. The scenarios compare the use of virgin aggregate with the use of a combination of both virgin and IBP aggregate, where the aggregate material is selected based on proximity to the construction site and allows for minimization of transportation impacts. The results indicate that the use of IBPs to supplement virgin aggregate on a regional level has the potential of reducing impacts related to energy use, global warming potential, and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), PM10 (particulate matter-10 microns), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb). Regional management of industrial by-products would allow for the incorporation of these materials into the industrial ecology of a region and reduce impacts from the disposal of the IBP materials and the extraction of virgin materials and minimize the impacts from transportation. The combination of reduced economic and environmental costs provides a strong argument for state transportation agencies to develop symbiotic relationships with large IBP producers in their regions to minimize impacts associated with roadway construction and maintenance-with the additional benefit of improved management of these materials. © 2009 by Yale University.","Beneficial use; Industrial capital management; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Road construction; Transportation impacts","Beneficial use; Capital management; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life-cycle assessments; Transportation impacts; Aggregates; Carbon monoxide; Coal ash; Cost reduction; Ecology; Extraction; Foundry practice; Foundry sand; Global warming; Highway administration; Lead; Materials handling; Mercury (metal); Metal recovery; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Road construction; Roads and streets; Slags; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Transportation; Industry; carbon monoxide; energy use; environmental economics; environmental protection; global warming; lead; life cycle analysis; mercury (element); nitrogen oxides; road; road construction; transportation infrastructure; urban area; Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh; United States",,,,,,"(2006) Standard Practice For Evaluating the Engineering and Environmental Suitability of Recycled Materials -pp-056-06, , AASHTO (American Association of State High-ways and Transportation Officials)., Washington, D.C., USA: American Association of State Highways and Transportation Officials; (2004) Coal Combustion Product (ccp) Production and Use Survey, , ACAA (American Coal Ash Association); (2006) Annual Statistical Report, , AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute)., Washington, D.C., USA: American Steel and Iron Institute; (2003) Standard Guide For Design and Construction of Coal Ash Structural Fills - E2277-03, p. 2007. , ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials)., West Conshohocken, PA, USA: ASTM International.
