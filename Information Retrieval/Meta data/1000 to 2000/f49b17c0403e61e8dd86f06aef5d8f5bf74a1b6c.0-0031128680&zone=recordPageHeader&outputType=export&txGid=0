Migrants (>156 000 pigmented elvers and >189 000 juveniles) were trapped as they attempted to ascend weir or sluice barriers. Multiple regression models were developed to compare catches per trap per night (C) with data for various key environmental parameters at seven sites, from the tidal limit to a maximum of 42.5 km upstream. The key stimulus for migration of both elvers and juveniles at the tidal limit was water temperature, with some weaker monthly influences related to seasonal temperature increases. Smaller annual influences probably related to earlier glass eel recruitment into the lower estuary. A weak early tidal effect was demonstrated only once, in 1993 in the Severn. Temperature also exerted significant effects on C of juvenile eels at the tidal limit and in the non-tidal rivers, although effects weakened with distance upstream. Year, month, river flows and whether traps were mounted on weirs or sluices made only small contributions at a few sites. Distance between traps also contributed to combined data for upper Severn sites. The threshold temperature in all cases was 14-16°C, with low zero catches below 10-11°C, catch maxima being achieved above 18-20°C. The implications of strong temperature-dependence of migration in relation to stock recruitment and management are discussed. Special reference is made to recent decreases in recruitment of eels to Europe and N. America and possible long-term effects of global warming.","Anguilla anguilla; elver; environmental factors; juvenile eel; migration","eel; fish juvenile; migration; temperature; tidal influence; UK, England, Avon River; UK, England, Severn River; Anguilla anguilla",,,,,,"Aprahamian, M.W., Age structure of eel, Anguitta anguilla (L.), populations in the river Severn, England, and the river Dee, Wales (1988) Aquaculture and Fisheries Management, 19, pp. 365-376; Barbin, G.P., Kreuger, W.H., Behaviour and swimming performance of elvers of the American eel, Anguilla rostrata, in an experimental flume (1994) Journal of Fish Biology, 45, pp. 111-122; Castonguay, M., Hodson, P.V., Couillard, C.M., Eckersley, M.J., Dutil, J.-D., Verrault, G., Why is recruitment of the American eel, Anguilla rostrata, declining in the St. Lawrence river and gulf?
