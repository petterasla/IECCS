However, this energy use is a significant contributor to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and, hence, global warming. Capture and disposal of CO2 has received increased R&amp;D attention in the last decade as the technology promises to be the most cost effective for large scale reductions in CO2 emissions. This paper addresses CO2 transport via pipeline from capture site to disposal site, in terms of system optimization, energy efficiency and overall economics. Technically, CO2 can be transported through pipelines in the form of a gas, a supercritical fluid or in the subcooled liquid state. Operationally, most CO2 pipelines used for enhanced oil recovery transport CO2 as a supercritical fluid. In this paper, supercritical fluid and subcooled liquid transport are examined and compared, including their impacts on energy efficiency and cost. Using a commercially available process simulator, ASPEN PLUS 10.1, the results show that subcooled liquid transport maximizes the energy efficiency and minimizes the cost of CO2 transport over long distances under both isothermal and adiabatic conditions. Pipeline transport of subcooled liquid CO2 can be ideally used in areas of cold climate or by burying and insulating the pipeline. In very warm climates, periodic refrigeration to cool the CO2 below its critical point of 31.1 °C, may prove economical. Simulations have been used to determine the maximum safe pipeline distances to subsequent booster stations as a function of inlet pressure, environmental temperature and ground level heat flux conditions.","Carbon dioxide; Compression; Energy efficiency; Pipeline; Sequestration; Transportation","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Optimization; Pipelines; Sequestrations; Subcooled liquid state; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, 1971-1997, 1999 Ed.; Gale, J., Freund, P., Coal-bed methane enhancement with CO2 sequestration worldwide potential (2001) Environ Geosci, 8 (3), pp. 210-217; Meisen, A., Shuai, X., Research and development issues in CO2 capture (1997) Energ Convers Manage, 38, pp. S37-S42; Costa, J.D., (2000) Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Molecular Sieve Silica Membranes for Gas Separation, , PhD dissertation.
