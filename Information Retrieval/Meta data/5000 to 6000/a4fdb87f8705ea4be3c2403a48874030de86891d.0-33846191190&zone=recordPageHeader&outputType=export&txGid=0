The CLC concept is based on the split of a conventional combustion of gas fuel into separate reduction and oxidation reactions. The oxygen transfer from air to fuel is accomplished by means of an oxygen carrier in the form of a metal oxide circulating between two interconnected reactors. A Cu-based material (Cu14Al) prepared by impregnation of γ-Al2O3 as support with two different particle sizes (0.1-0.3 mm, 0.2-0.5 mm) was used as an oxygen carrier for a chemical-looping combustion of methane. A 10 kWth CLC prototype composed of two interconnected bubbling fluidized bed reactors has been designed, built in and operated at 800 °C during 100 h for each particle size. In the reduction stage full conversion of CH4 to CO2 and H2O was achieved using oxygen carrier-to-fuel ratios above 1.5. Some CuO losses as the active phase of the CLC process were detected during the first 50 h of operation, mainly due to the erosion of the CuO present in external surface of the alumina particles. The high reactivity of the oxygen carrier maintained during the whole test, the low attrition rate detected after 100 h of operation, and the absence of any agglomeration problem revealed a good performance of these CuO-based materials as oxygen carriers in a CLC process. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
