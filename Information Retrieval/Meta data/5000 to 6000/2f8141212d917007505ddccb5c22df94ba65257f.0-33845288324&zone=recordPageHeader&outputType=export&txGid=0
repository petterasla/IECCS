This paper examines the potential impacts of climate change on London's transport systems, based on the findings of a research study undertaken for the London Climate Change Partnership between 2004 and 2005. Recent extreme weather events have had significant impact on London's transport systems; for example, the effect of high temperatures on London Underground and major flooding of roads and railway stations. Scenarios of climate change show that London will experience hotter summers, wetter winters, more intense rainfall and a rise in sea level over the coming century. This poses a number of risks to the operation and use of transport systems in a city where 26 million trips are made every day. The study focuses on four case studies. Each case study assesses: the issue now, drawing on current weather-related effects; how climate change will affect the future; the action already underway in London to address climate impacts; and options and timescales for adaptation. It is apparent that most risks already exist - climate change will simply make them worse. With forward planning, successful and cost-effective adaptation can be achieved.","Infrastructure planning; Transport management; Weather","Cost effectiveness; Roads and streets; Transportation; Infrastructure planning; Transport management; Weather; Global warming; climate change; climate effect; flooding; hazard management; infrastructure planning; temperature effect; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; weather; England; Eurasia; Europe; London [England]; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,"(2002) London's Warming: The Impacts of Climate Change on London, , LONDON CLIMATE CHANGE PARTNERSHIP.
