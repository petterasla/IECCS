We also analyse the development of some classical branches of landscape ecology regarding pattern and process relationships at broad spatial and temporal scales, such as landscape metrics, the influence of anthropogenic factors and global climate change on landscape development, the fragmentation of ecosystems and disturbances of populations, and material and energy cycling in and between ecosystems. © The Author(s), 2009.","Global change; Landscape aesthetics; Landscape genetics; Landscape perception; Landscape planning; Marine space ecology; Natural disasters; Seascape","esthetics; future prospect; geographical thought; global change; interdisciplinary approach; landscape ecology; landscape evolution; landscape planning",,,,,,"Alessa, L.N., Kliskey, A.A., Williams, P., Barton, M., Perception of change in freshwater in remote resource-dependent Arctic communities (2008) Global Environmental Change, 18, pp. 153-164; Anisimov, O.A., Potential feedback of thawing permafrost to the global climate system through methane emission (2007) Environmental Research Letters, 2, p. 045016. , DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/045016; Antolin, M.F., Savage, L.T., Eizen, R.J., Landscape features influence genetic structure of Black-Tailed Prairie Dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) (2006) Landscape Ecology, 21, pp. 867-875; Appleton, J., Landscape evaluation: The theoretical vacuum (1975) Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers NS, 66, pp. 120-123; Appleton, J., (1975) The Experience of Landscape, , New York: Wiley; Arheimer, B., Brandt, M., Watershed modelling of non-point nitrogen from arable land to the Swedish coast in 1985 and 1994 (2000) Ecological Engineering, 14, pp. 389-404; Arriaza, M., Cañas-Ortega, J.F., Cãas-Maduẽo, J.A., Ruiz-Aviles, P., Assessing the visual quality of rural landscapes (2004) Landscape and Urban Planning, 69, pp. 115-125; Aviron, S., Burel, F., Baudry, J., Schermann, N., Carabid assemblages in agricultural landscapes: Impacts of habitat features, landscape context at different spatial scales and farming intensity (2005) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 108, pp. 205-217; Bastian, O., Landscape ecology: Towards a unified discipline?
