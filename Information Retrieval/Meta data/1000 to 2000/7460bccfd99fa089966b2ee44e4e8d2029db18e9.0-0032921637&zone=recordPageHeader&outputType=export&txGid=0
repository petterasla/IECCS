Epilithic lichens are suggested as biological monitors. The proposed methodology of such monitoring consists of a sampling scheme, including lichen measurement along transects on flat calcareous rocks, and construction of a trend detection index (TDI). TDI is a sum of lichen species cover with coefficients chosen so as to ensure maximum ability to detect global climate trends. Coefficients have been estimated in a study of lichens along an altitudinal gradient from 500 to 1000 m a.s.l. The gradient study demonstrated that the TDI index is performed better than other integrated indices. Recommendations on this system to monitor climate change with epilthic lichens are given. Measuring, for instance, a hundred transects in fifty plots (two transet per plot scheme) allows one to detect a climate-driven change in the epilithic lichen community corresponding to a 0.8°C shift in annual mean temperature. Such resolution appears sufficient in view of global warming of 2.5°C considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a realistic prediction for the end of the next century.","Biological indicators; Change; Epilithic lichens; Global climate; Israel; Monitoring; Negev desert","Epilithic lichens; Trend detection index (TDI); Biomarkers; Environmental engineering; Global warming; Plants (botany); Climatology; biomonitoring; climate change; lichen; monitoring system; altitude; article; biological monitoring; global climate; greenhouse effect; Israel; lichens; methodology; nonhuman; rock; temperature; Israel",,,,,,"Ben-David, R., Mazor, E., Stages in the Evolution of Makhtesh Ramon (1988) Isr.
