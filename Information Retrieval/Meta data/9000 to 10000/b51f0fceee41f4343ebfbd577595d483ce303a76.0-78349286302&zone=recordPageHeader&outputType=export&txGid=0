Biostratigraphic and isotope stratigraphic studies indicate that the PETM event is well documented in the marl deposits of the Yuhuangding section in the Nanyang Basin, Central China, with a carbon isotope negative excursion of ~6.1‰ within 19-m-thick marl deposits. This is the highest resolution record of the PETM so far found in the world. The PETM event was triggered within 2-cm-thick marl sediments, with a decrease of δ13C (stable carbon isotope ratio) from -3.2‰ to -5.2‰, suggesting a massive methane hydrate release for a transient period that was possibly caused by a catastrophic event. A comparison between marine and terrestrial records indicates a ""Three-Phase Model"" for the PETM event. Initially there is a rapid negative excursion in the δ13C record, followed by a slowly decreasing trend, and then a gradual positive recovery, corresponding respectively to a rapid dissociation of oceanic methane hydrate, followed by a slow release of methane and then the consumption of the released methane. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","carbon isotope; greenhouse gases; Nanyang Basin; PETM",,,,,,,"Dickens, G.R., O'Neil, J.R., Rea, D.K., Dissociation of oceanic methane hydrate as a cause of the carbon isotope excursion at the end of the Paleocene (1995) Paleoceanography, 10, pp. 965-971; Svensen, H., Planke, S., Malthe-Sørenssen, A., Release of methane from a volcanic basin as a mechanism for initial Eocene global warming (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 542-545; Kurtz, A.C., Kump, L.R., Authur, M.A., Early Cenozoic decoupling of the global carbon and sulfur cycles (2003) Paleoceanography, 18, pp. 1090-1103; Higgins, J.A., Schrag, D.P., Beyond methane: Towards a theory for the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (2006) Earth Planet Sci Lett, 145, pp. 523-537; Kennett, J.P., Stott, L.D., Abrupt deep-sea warming, paleoceanographic changes and benthic extinctions at the end of Palaeocene (1991) Nature, 353, pp. 225-229; Thomas, E., Shackleton, N.J., The latest Paleocene benthic foraminiferal extinction and stable isotope anomalies (1996) Correlation of the Early Paleogene In Northwest Europe.
