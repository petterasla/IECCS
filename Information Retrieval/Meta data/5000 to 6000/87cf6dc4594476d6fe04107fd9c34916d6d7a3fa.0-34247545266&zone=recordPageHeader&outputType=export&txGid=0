Methane (CH4) is especially interesting as it contributes to the greenhouse gas emission and thus also to the global warming. CH4 production and its relation to fermentation in growing pigs (74 diets) as well as adult sows (36 diets), were investigated in diets varying greatly in chemical composition. All diets were assayed in digestibility and energy balance experiments in respiration chambers. Growing pigs fed diets varying in total fibre content (2.8-40%) had a CH4 production equivalent to 0.1 to 1.3% of digested energy (DE). Non-lactating sows fed at maintenance had a CH4 production equivalent to 0.4 to 3.3 % of DE. Intensively fed lactating sows had the lowest CH4 production (about 0.6% of DE). In general, the production of methane depended on fibre origin, however high variation was found between animals. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
