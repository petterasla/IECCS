The major objective was to focus on N2O releases as either a positive or negative feedback in response to global warming. The soils of a fallow field and a wheat field were heated 3°C above ambient temperature and N2O fluxes were measured weekly from June 1994 to March 1996. During the experimental period, measured temperature differences between the control plots and the heated plots were 2.9±0.3°C at a depth of 0.01 m and 1.0-1.8°C at a depth of 1 m. Soil moisture decreased with the elevated soil temperatures of the heated plots. The mean differences in soil moisture between the treatments were 6.4% (fallow field) and 5.2%(DW) (wheat field dry weight, DW), respectively. Overall N2O releases during the experimental period from the fallow field were 4.8 kg N2O-N ha-1 in the control plot against 5.0 kg N2O-N ha-1 in the heated plot, and releases from the wheat field were 8.0 N2O-N ha-1 in the control plot and 7.6 N2O-N kg ha-1 in the heated plot. However, on a seasonal basis, cumulated N2O emissions differed between the plots. During the summer months (May-October), releases from the heated fallow plot were 3 times the rates from the control plot. In the winter months, N2O releases increased in both the fallow and wheat fields and were related to the number of freezing and thawing cycles.","Agriculture; Ecosystem manipulation; Global warming; Nitrous oxide; Soil warming","environmental management; fallow; freezing; greenhouse effect; measurement; nitrous oxide emission; soil degradation; soil; temperature; thawing; wheat; global warming; nitrogen; soil emission",,,,,,"Badr, O., Probert, S.D., Nitrous oxide in the earth's atmosphere (1992) Appl Energy, 41, pp. 177-200; Bandibas, J., Vermoesen, A., Degroot, C.J., Van Cleemput, O., The effect of different moisture regimes and soil characteristics on nitrous oxide emission and consumption by different soils (1994) Soil Sci, 158, pp. 106-114; Bauchhenss, J., Beck, T., Graf, R., Haisch, A., Jordan, F., Schuch, M., Vaitl, W., Zant, M., (1982) Agrotherm Gundremmingen - Abschlußbericht (in German), , Bayer Landesanst Bodenkultur Pflanzenbau, München; Beauchamp, E.G., Nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils (1997) Can J Soil Sci, 77, pp. 113-123; Benckiser, G., Relationships between field-measured denitrification losses, CO2 formation and diffusional constraints (1994) Soil Biol Biochem, 26, pp. 891-899; Bouwman, A.F., Exchange of greenhouse gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere (1990) Soils and the Greenhouse Effect, pp. 61-167. , Bouwman AF (ed) Wiley Chichester; Burton, D.L., Bergstrom, D.W., Covert, J.A., Wagner-Riddle, C., Beauchamp, E.G., Three methods to estimate N2O fluxes as impacted by agricultural management (1997) Can J Soil Sci, 77, pp. 125-134; Crutzen, P.J., The influence of nitrogen oxides on the atmospheric ozone content (1970) QJR Meteorol Soc, 96, pp. 320-325; Flessa, H., Dörsch, P., Beese, F., Seasonal variability of N2O and CH4 fluxes in differently managed arable soils in Southern Germany (1995) J Geophys Res, 100, pp. 23115-23124; Groffman, P.M., Tiedje, J.M., Relationships between denitrification, CO2 production and air-tilled porosity in soils of different texture and drainage (1991) Soil Biol Biochem, 23, pp. 299-302; Hansen, S., Mælum, J.E., Bakken, L.R., N2O and CH4 fluxes in soil influenced by fertilization and tractor traffic (1992) Soil Biol Biochem, 25, pp. 621-630; Hantschel, R.E., Kamp, T., Beese, F., Increasing the soil temperature to study global warming effects on the soil nitrogen cycle in agroecosystems (1995) J Biogeogr, 22, pp. 375-380; Harrison, P.A., Butterfield, R.E., Downing, T.E., (1995) Climate Change and Agriculture in Europe - Assessment of Impacts and Adaptation, , Environmental Change Unit, research report no. 9.
