Here, we calculate the energy content of nationwide food waste from the difference between the US food supply and the food consumed by the population. The latter was estimated using a validated mathematical model of metabolism relating body weight to the amount of food eaten. We found that US per capita food waste has progressively increased by ∼50% since 1974 reaching more than 1400 kcal per person per day or 150 trillion kcal per year. Food waste now accounts for more than one quarter of the total freshwater consumption and ∼300 million barrels of oil per year.",,"article; catering service; energy yield; environmental impact; food intake; food spoilage; food waste; human; physical activity; waste; weight gain; Western Hemisphere; agriculture; body weight; chemistry; climate; environment; environmental protection; food; methodology; sewage; statistical model; theoretical model; United States; waste disposal; water pollutant; carbon dioxide; Agriculture; Body Weight; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Food; Humans; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; United States; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Water Pollutants",,,,"von Braun, J., Ahmed, A., Asenso-Okyere, K., Fan, S., Gulati, A., (2008) High food prices: The what, who, and how of proposed policy actions, , Washington D.C, International Food Policy Research Institute; Wiggins, S., Levy, S., (2008) Rising food prices: Cause for concern, , London: Overseas Development Institute; Griffin, M., Sobal, J., Lyson, T.A., An analysis of a community food waste stream (2009) Agric Hum Values, 26, pp. 67-81; Kantor, L.S., Lipton, K., Manchester, A., Oliveira, V., Estimating and addressing America's food losses (1997) Food Review, 20, pp. 2-12; Muth, M.K., Kosa, K.M., Nielsen, S.M., Karns, S.A., Exploratory research on estimation of consumer-level food loss conversion factors (2007), Agreement No. 58-4000-6-0121, Final ReportVentour, L., (2008) The food we waste, , WRAP and Exodus market research; http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx, FAOSTAT, AvailableFood balance sheets: A handbook.
