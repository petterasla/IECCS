An abrupt enhancement of summer monsoon in the 1920s and its synchronism with the global rapid warming have been detected by the Mann-Kendall Rank Statistic test. Based on diagnostic analysis on the atmospheric circulation over the monsoon region and the thermal conditions of both ocean and land during the period of abrupt change, it is found that the warming over land was stronger and earlier than that over the ocean, which would enhance the land-sea thermal contrast and therefore be favorable to the development of monsoon low and the disturbance in the monsoon flow. This may be a direct factor for the abrupt enhancement of summer monsoon. © 1992.","abrupt climatic change; global warming; monsoon","climate change; global warming; monsoon",,,,,,,"Fu, C.-b.; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Academia Sinica, Beijing, 100080, China",,,,,,,,1001652X,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027059550
