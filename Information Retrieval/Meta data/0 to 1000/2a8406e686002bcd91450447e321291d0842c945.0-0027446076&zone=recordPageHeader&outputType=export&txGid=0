The known effects that methane has on the atmosphere are reviewed and the relationship to those effects caused by other greenhouse gases is described. A methodology utilized in assessing the quantity of landfill gas emitted from landfill sites is described, as are the main principles used in a gas generation model. Results of a survey, field trials and categorisation of the many types of site condition and waste mixtures are explainted, including the techniques incorporated into the model to allow a potential gas yield to be predicted. The factors that limit this potential yield of methane such as the oxidizing capacity of soil are identified and assessed. The potential effect of landfill-gas utilisation on the total emission and the economic viability of such schemes is reviewed in relation to reduced carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Combustion of landfill gas is shown to make a small net contribution to the potential equivalent CO2 reductions. The economics of energy recovery from landfill gas associated with CO2 reductions are shown to be significantly better than other alternative energy forms. © 1992.",,"atmospheric pollution; gas emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; landfill; methane yield; UK; Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Gaseous effluents; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Methane; Reduction; Waste utilization; Global warming; Landfill gas utilization; United Kingdom landfills; Land fill",,,,,,"Jaegaer, The changing atmosphere (1988) Paper presented at 9th International Seminar on Environmental Impact Assessment, , University of Aberdeen; Greenhouse effect will accelerate (1990) Daily Telegraph, p. 6; Environmental Data Services Ltd, Scientific consensus will favour curbs on greenhouse gases (1990) Report 181, pp. 9-10; Environmental Data Services Ltd, Getting to grips with greenhouse-gas emissions (1989) Report 179, pp. 11-13; Pearce, Methane: The hidden greenhouse gas (1989) New Scientist, pp. 37-41; Church, Shepherd, The ozone hole and the greenhouse effect (1989) Gas Engng and Management, 29; Richards, (1989) All gas and garbage.
