The naturally developed Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is one of the most pronounced low oxygen ocean environments known today. The OMZ impinges the Indian margin where oxygen concentration reaches values less than 0.05 ml/l leading denitrification. In recent studies, it has been observed that the OMZ strength has varied considerably in the past, in tune with the global climate change. But the effect of changes in natural mid-water hypoxic environment on the marine biota particularly of the eastern Arabian Sea is unknown. Here, we analyzed 30,000 yr record of temporal changes in two major groups of marine calcifying microfauna pteropods secreting aragonitic shells and foraminifera secreting calcitic shells in terms of abundance and diversity variations. This study will provide an insight into our understanding of potential impact of rising atmospheric CO 2 on marine ecosystem.","Aragonite lysocline; Calcitic shells; Global climate change; Oxygen depletion",,,,,,,"Alabet, M.A., Francois, D., Murray, W., Prell, W.L., Climate - related variations in denitrification in the Arabian Sea from 15N/ 14N ratios (1995) Nature, 373, pp. 195-509; Millero, F.J., (1996) Chemical Oceanography, pp. 1-469. , CRC Press, Boca Raton; Naqvi, S.W.A., Jayakumar, D.A., Narvekar, P.V., Naik, H., Sarma, V.S., D'Souza, W., Joseph, T., George, M.D., Increased marine production of N 2O due to intensifying anoxia on the Indian continental shelf (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 346-349; Reichart, G.J., Lourens, L.J., Zachariasse, W.J., Temporal variability in the northern Arabian Sea Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) during the last 225,000 years (1998) Paleocenography, 13, pp. 607-621; Riebesell, U., Zondervan, I., Rost, B., Tortell, P.D., Zeebe, R.E., Morel, F.M.M., Reduced calcification of marine plankton in response to increased atmospheric CO 2 (2000) Nature, 407, pp. 364-367; Singh, A.D., Kroon, D., Ganeshram, R.S., Productivity and OMZ intensity variations in the Eastern Arabian Sea at the Millennial scale (2006) Indian Monsoon, Special Publication of the Geological Society of India, 68, pp. 369-377; Singh, A.D., Episodic preservation of pteropods in the eastern Arabian Sea: Monsoonal change, oxygen minimum zone intensity and aragonite compensation depth (2007) Indian Journal of Marine Science, 36, pp. 378-383; Singh, A.D., Singh, O.P., Potentiality of Pteropods in Reconstruction of the Quaternary Climatic and Oceanographic History of the Arabian Sea"", Special Issue on ""Applied Micropaleontology (2010) Gondwana Geological Magazine, 25 (1), pp. 81-88","Singh, A.
