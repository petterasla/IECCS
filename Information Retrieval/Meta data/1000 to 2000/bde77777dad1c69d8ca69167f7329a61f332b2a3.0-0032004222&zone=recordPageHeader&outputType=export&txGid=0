If this continues, CO2 emissions in this sector may increase through the first half of the 21st century. Consequently, a study of measures for reducing these CO2 emissions is essential. In this paper, possible automotive technologies, improvements in fuel consumption and the introduction of electric vehicles are discussed. These measures are then evaluated for the Japanese case. Furthermore, market penetration of these technologies is evaluated, using life-cycle cost analysis based on initial cost and annual fuel cost. It is concluded that reducing CO2 emissions to 1995 levels by 2010 is possible. This would require the simultaneous implementation of fuel-consumption improvements and the introduction of electric vehicles. However, automotive consumers would be reluctant to accept these technologies, particularly electric vehicles, because of their high purchase-price and low benefits in terms of operating economy. Acceptance will require financial and institutional support from the public sector in introducing these automotive technologies into the Japanese transportation sector.",,"Automotive transportation sector; Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Fuel consumption; Global warming; Electric vehicles; automotive technology; carbon dioxide emissions; electric vehicles; fuel consumption; Japan",,,,,,"Okano, H., Toyota lean-burn engine (1992) Proceedings of Lean-burn Engine Symposium, pp. 20-25. , Tokyo, Japan Society of Automotive Engineering; (1995) Nikkei Mechanical, pp. 38-44. , Nikkei BP, Tokyo, August; Nakajima, Y., Automotive society in the 21st century (1995) Japan Journal of Resources and Environmental Measures, 31, pp. 32-44; Kobayashi, O., Analysis of the effect of reducing CO2 emissions of electric vehicles, considering the differences of electric generation system in each country (1993) Automotive Transportation, pp. 22-25. , Nissan Motor Co., Tokyo; (1991) Study on the Social, Economic, Environmental, and Energy Impacts of Introducing Electric Vehicles, pp. 95-101. , National Institute for Research Advancement, Japan; Takeishi, T., Kobayashi, O., Cost-effectiveness of introducing alternative-energy vehicles (1993) Automotive Transportation, pp. 18-21. , Nissan Motor Co., Tokyo; Mackenzie, J.J., Walsh, M.P., (1990) Driving Forces: Motor Vehicle Trends and Their Implications for Global Warming, Energy Strategies, and Transportation Planning, pp. 11-38. , World Resources Institute, Washington, DC; (1995) Monthly Statistics of Automotive Industries, pp. 42-43. , Japan Society of Automotive Industries, Tokyo, March; (1993) Population Trends of Japan and the World, p. 23. , Institute for the Population Problem, The Ministry of Welfare, Tokyo, Japan; (1994) Statistics of Automotive Industries, pp. 192-193. , Japan Society of Automotive Industries, Tokyo; Takeishi, T., Kobayashi, O., Market acceptability of alternative energy vehicles (1996) Proceedings of 12th Energy System and Economic Conference, pp. 37-42. , Tokyo; Edmonds, J., Reilly, J., A long-term global energy-economic model of carbon-dioxide release from fossil fuel use (1983) Energy Economics, , April; Dean, A., Hoeller, P., Costs of reducing CO2 emissions: Evidence from six global models (1992) Economic Costs of Reducing CO2 Emissions, pp. 15-47. , OECD, Paris; (1995) Statistical Handbook of Energy and Economy, pp. 36-37. , The Energy Data and Modeling Center, Tokyo, Japan; (1990) Climate Change, the IPCC Response Strategies, p. 22. , IPCC, WMO/UNEP","Imaseki, T.; Sch Interdisciplinary Eng, Univ of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku Tokyo 153, Japan",,,,,,,,03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.
