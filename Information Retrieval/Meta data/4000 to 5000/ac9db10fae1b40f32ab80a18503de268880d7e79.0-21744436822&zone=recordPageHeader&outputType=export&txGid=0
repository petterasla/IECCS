This in turn leads to large uncertainties in the sensitivity of climate to human perturbations, and therefore also in carbon cycle feedbacks and projections of climate change. In the future, aerosol cooling is expected to decline relative to greenhouse gas forcing, because of the aerosols' much shorter lifetime and the pursuit of a cleaner atmosphere. Strong aerosol cooling in the past and present would then imply that future global warming may proceed at or even above the upper extreme of the range projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",,"Carbon; Climatology; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Sensitivity analysis; Aerosol cooling; Carbon cycle; Greenhouse gases; Projections; Atmospheric aerosols; carbon dioxide; mineral; organic compound; rain; sulfate; aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; aerosol; atmosphere; carbon cycle; climate change; cloud; cooling; energy; environmental temperature; futurology; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heat; light absorption; mineral dust; photosynthesis; priority journal; review; sea; soil; sun; sunlight; thermodynamics; warming",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; sulfate, 14808-79-8",,,,"Houghton, J.T., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
