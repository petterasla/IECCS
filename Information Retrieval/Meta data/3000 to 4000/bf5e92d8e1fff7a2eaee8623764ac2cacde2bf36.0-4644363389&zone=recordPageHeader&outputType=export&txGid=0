Biodiesel fuel is produced from renewable natural bio-sources and is easily combustible, and therefore various processes involved in biodiesel fuel production have been recently developed. In the present study, we produced biodiesel transportation fuel from fish waste oil using ozone treatments and evaluated its properties as an alternative to diesel fuel. Ozone treatment lowered the flash point of the produced fuel, resulting in easy combustibility. Quantitative changes in the amounts of fatty acids that form triglycerides and hydrocarbons in three oil samples (untreated and ozone treated) were also shown. Total ion chromatograms produced from gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) revealed that the fatty acid compositions of fish waste oil decompose giving rise to hydrocarbons. The ozone treated fish waste oil was considered to be a suitable alternative to diesel fuel from the viewpoint of fuel quality and exhaust gases. © 2004 The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.","Biodiesel; Fatty acids; Fish waste oil; Hydrocarbons; Ozone","Chromatographic analysis; Diesel fuels; Flammability; Global warming; Hydrocarbons; Oils and fats; Ozone; Biodiesel fuels; Fish oil; Ozone treatment; Waste oils; Fossil fuels; alternative energy",,,,,,"Alcantara, R., Amores, J., Canoira, L., Fidaldo, E., Franco, M.J., Navarro, A., Catalytic production of biodiesel from soy-bean oil, used frying oil and tarrow (2000) Biomass and Bioenergy, 18, pp. 515-527; Bondioli, P., Gasparili, A., Lanzani, A., Fedeli, E., Veronese, S., Sala, M., Strage stability of biodiesel (1995) J.
