Biological responses reflect selection due to the earlier arrival of spring, the later arrival of fall, or the increasing length of the growing season. Animals from rotifers to rodents use the high reliability of day length to time the seasonal transitions in their life histories that are crucial to fitness in temperate and polar environments: when to begin developing in the spring, when to reproduce, when to enter dormancy or when to migrate, thereby exploiting favourable temperatures and avoiding unfavourable temperatures. In documented cases of evolutionary (genetic) response to recent, rapid climate change, the role of day length (photoperiodism) ranges from causal to inhibitory; in no case has there been demonstrated a genetic shift in thermal optima or thermal tolerance. More effort should be made to explore the role of photoperiodism in genetic responses to climate change and to rule out the role of photoperiod in the timing of seasonal life histories before thermal adaptation is assumed to be the major evolutionary response to climate change. © 2007 The Authors.","Day length; Evolution; Genetic response; Global warming; Photoperiodism; Seasonal timing","adaptation; animal; climate; genetics; geography; greenhouse effect; mosquito; photoperiodicity; review; season; songbird; time; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Climate; Culicidae; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Passeriformes; Photoperiod; Seasons; Time Factors; Animalia; Rodentia; Rotifera",,,,,,"Ayala, F.J., Serra, L.L., Prevosti, A., A grand experiment in evolution: The Drosophila subobscura colonization of the Americas (1989) Genome, 31, pp. 246-255; Balanyá, J., Oller, J.M., Huey, R.B., Global genetic change tracks global climate warming in Drosophila subobscura (2006) Science, 313, pp. 1773-1775; Bearhop, S., Fiedler, W., Furness, R.W., Assortative mating as a mechanism for rapid evolution of a migratory divide (2005) Science, 310, pp. 502-504; Van Berkum, F.H., Evolutionary patterns of the thermal sensitivity of sprint speed in Anolis lizards (1986) Evolution, 40, pp. 594-604; Van Berkum, F.H., Latitudinal patterns of the thermal sensitivity of sprint speed in lizards (1988) American Naturalist, 132, pp. 327-343; Berteaux, D., Réale, D., McAdam, A.G., Keeping pace with fast climate change: Can arctic life count on evolution?
