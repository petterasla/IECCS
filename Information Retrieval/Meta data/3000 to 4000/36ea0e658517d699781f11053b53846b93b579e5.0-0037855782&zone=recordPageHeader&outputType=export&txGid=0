Mitigation - curtailing greenhouse gas emissions dominated initial discussions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and international conferences on global climate change. Now that climate change has become a clear and present danger, however, adaptation - lessening the harm and maximizing the benefits of climate change - has received more attention. Analysis reveals that integrating the two responses, though challenging, may be the most effective approach.",,"adaptation; climate change; cost benefit analysis; environmental management; global climate; greenhouse gas; review",,,,,,"Houghton, J., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Metz, B., (2001) Climate Change 2001: Mitigation, p. 13. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; McCarthy, J., (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, pp. 3-4. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; (2000) Climate Change Impacts on the United States, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; McCarthy et al., note 2 aboveClark, W.C., Assessing vulnerability to global environmental risks (2000) Discussion Paper 200-12, , Environment and Natural Resources Program, Kennedy School of Government (Cambridge: Harvard University; Speth, J.G., A new green regime: Attacking the root causes of global environmental deterioration (2002) Environment, pp. 16-25. , September; Kane, S., Shogren, J., Linking adaptation and mitigation in climate change policy (2000) Climatic Change, 45, pp. 75-102; The Adaptation Policy Framework, , (forthcoming), Figure SPM-2; (1997) Technology Opportunities to Reduce U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions, , (October): Appendix B, Technology Pathways Characterization; Wilbanks, T.J., Integrated Analysis of Mitigation and Adaptation as Responses to Concerns About Impacts of Global Climate Change, , ORNL Report (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory, forthcoming); The National Assessment Synthesis Team, note 3 aboveRozenweig, C., Solecki, W.D., (2001) Climate Change and a Global City: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, , New York: Columbia Earth Institute; Ruth, M., Kirshen, P., (2002) Dynamic Investigations into Climate Change Impacts on Urban Infrastructure: Background, Examples, and Lessons, , paper presented to the Western Regional Science Association, Monterey, Calif; www.ukcip.org.uk(2002) Climate Change in the Netherlands: Consequences and Adaptation Options, , Bilthoven; Kates, R.W., Wilbanks, T.J., Making the global local: Responding to climate change concerns from the bottom up (2003) Environment, pp. 12-23. , April; (2002) Climate Change Activities in the United States, , Arlington, Va.: Pew Center on Global Climate Change, June","Wilbanks, T.J.; Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN, United States; email: twz@ornl.gov",,,,,,,,00139157,,ENVTA,,"English","Environment",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037855782
