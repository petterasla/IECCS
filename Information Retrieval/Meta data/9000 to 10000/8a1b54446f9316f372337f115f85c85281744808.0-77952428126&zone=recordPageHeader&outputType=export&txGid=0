It is increasingly clear that even large-scale deployments of the best technologies available today cannot meet the rising energy demands of a growing world population. Achieving a secure and sustainable energy future will require full utilization of, and substantial improvements in, a comprehensive portfolio of energy systems and technologies. This goal is complicated by several factors. First, energy strategies are inextricably linked to national security and health issues. Second, in developing and deploying energy technologies, it is vital to consider not only environmental issues, such as global climate change, but also economic considerations, which strongly influence both public and political views on energy policy. Third, a significant and sustained effort in basic and applied research and development (R&D) will be required to deliver the innovations needed to ensure a desirable energy future. Innovations in materials science and engineering are especially needed to overcome the limits of essentially all energy technologies. A wealth of historical evidence demonstrates that such innovations are also the key to economic prosperity. From the development of the earliest cities around flint-trading centers, to the Industrial Revolution, to today's silicon-based global economy, the advantage goes to those who lead in exploiting materials. I view our challenge by considering the rate of innovation and the transition of discovery to the marketplace as the relationship among R&D investment, a skilled and talented workforce, business innovations, and the activities of competitors. Most disturbing in analyzing this relationship is the need for trained workers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). To develop the STEM workforce needed for innovation, we need sustainable, positive change in STEM education at all levels from preschool through postgraduate. Materials sciences can be a significant magnet in attracting students to STEM areas, and a focused effort is needed to ensure that it is included in STEM programs. From this effort will come the next generation of materials scientists and the innovations that will enable us to overcome the energy challenge. © 2010 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Basic and applied research; Business innovation; Economic considerations; Economic prosperity; Energy demands; Energy future; Energy strategy; Energy systems; Energy technologies; Environmental issues; Global climate changes; Global economies; Health issues; Industrial revolutions; Large-scale deployment; Materials science and engineering; Materials scientist; National security; Positive changes; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; Silicon-based; STEM education; STEM program; Sustainable energy; World population; Climate change; Competition; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Investments; Materials; Professional aspects; Technology; Innovation",,,,,,"(2009) Battelle: Battelle History, , http://www.battelle.org/ABOUTUS/history.aspx; (2009) Battelle: Battelle: 75 Years of Innovation, , http://www.battelle.org/ASSETS/36DC84C50C0049778FAE3A68E7FD1F02/75.pdf; Battelle, L.S., (1889) Battelle Genealogical Record, , Robert Clarke & Co Cincinnati, OH; Gordon Battelle, J., (1920) The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, 17, pp. 2-3. , James T.
