Pure and mixed swards of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) were established under ambient and warmed (+3.4°C) air temperatures, at ambient and 690 μmol mol-1 CO2 concentrations in field tunnels in temperate south-eastern Australia. Over one year, elevated CO2 increased clover foliage growth in the monoculture by 19%, and by 31% in the mixture. Warming reduced clover monoculture herbage production at ambient CO2 by 28% and reduced the growth enhancement by elevated CO2 to +8%. Forage growth of phalaris monoculture was not affected significantly by either factor. Forage growth of the mixture was increased by 34% in response to higher CO2, but unaffected by warming. Elevated CO2 combined with warming increased forage growth of the mixed sward by 23%. Concurrent rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration and temperature increased productivity of subterranean clover-phalaris swards. However, longer term effects on species competition and persistence may modify this conclusion.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Forage; Global warming; Pastures; Phalaris aquatica; Temperature gradient tunnel; Trifolium subterraneum","carbon dioxide enrichment; pasture; productivity; temperature effect",,,,,,"Bengtsson, L., Climate change, climate of the 21st century (1994) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 72, pp. 3-29; Bray, R.H., Kurtz, L.T., Determination of total, organic and available forms of phosphorus in soil (1945) Soil Science, 59, pp. 39-45; Carlson, I.T., Oram, R.N., Surprenant, J., Reed canarygrass and other phalaris species (1996) Cool-season forage grasses, pp. 569-604. , Moser LE, Buxton DR, Casler MD, eds.
