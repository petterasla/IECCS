This article addresses the concept of 'scale' and its relevance to the design and implementation of policy. Paul R. Schulman's 'theory of large-scale policy' is used to illuminate both prospects and problems of implementing climate change management strategies. This approach helps to highlight practical reasons why it will be a challenge to build or sustain international support for efforts to prevent or slow climate change. © 1992.",,"climatic change; environmental management; large-scale policy; management strategy",,,,,,"Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment (Report of Working Group 1), , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; World Meteorological Organization, Report of the International Conference on the Assessment of the Role of Carbon Dioxide and of Other Greenhouse Gases in Climate Variations and Associated Impacts (1985) WMO No 661, , For example, World Meteorological Organization, Geneva; National Research Council, (1987) Current Issues in Atmospheric Change, , National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Tegart, Sheldon, Griffiths, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Impacts Assessment, , Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra; National Academy of Sciences, (1991) Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming, , For example, National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Office of Technology Assessment, Changing By Degrees: Steps To Reduce Greenhouse Gases (1991) OTA-0-482, , US Govenrment Printing Office, Washington, DC; World Meteorological Organization/United Nations Environment Programme, (1991) Climate Change: The IPCC Response Strategies, , Island Press, Washington, DC; Delegates adopt negotiating guidelines in first effort toward climate convention (1991) International Environment Reporter, 14, p. 97; Collins, Climate change negotiations polarize (1991) Ambio, 20 (7), pp. 340-344; Schmidt, ‘Industrial countries’ responses to global climate change (1991) Environmental and Energy Study Institute Special Report, , Washington, DC; The hot-air summit (1991) The Economist, 321 (7736), p. 15; Schulman, (1980) Large-Scale Policy Making, , Elsevier-North Holland, New York; National Academy of Sciences, (1991) Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Report of the Mitigation Panel, , National Academy Press, Washington, DC, Ch 10; McKeon, (1941) The Complete Works of Aristotle, p. 1284. , Random House, New York; Sabine, (1961) A History of Political Theory, pp. 96-97. , 3 ed, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York; Sabine, (1961) A History of Political Theory, pp. 124-125. , 3 ed, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York; Hobbes, (1964) Leviathan, p. 85. , Washington Square Press, New York, Part I, Ch XIII; Locke, (1963) Two Treatises of Government, , Cambridge University Press, New York, Ch 5, §32; (1961) The Federalist Papers, p. 101. , New American Library, New York; Schulman, (1980) Large-Scale Policy Making, p. 6. , Elsevier-North Holland, New York; Schulman, (1980) Large-Scale Policy Making, p. 7. , Elsevier-North Holland, New York; Lindblom, The science of “muddling through” (1959) Public Administration Review, 19, pp. 79-88; Schulman, (1980) Large-Scale Policy Making, p. 7. , Elsevier-North Holland, New York; Schulman, (1980) Large-Scale Policy Making, p. 15. , Elsevier-North Holland, New York; Schulman, (1980) Large-Scale Policy Making, p. 16. , Elsevier-North Holland, New York; Schulman, (1980) Large-Scale Policy Making, p. 7. , Elsevier-North Holland, New York; Schulman, (1980) Large-Scale Policy Making, p. 137. , Elsevier-North Holland, New York; Katz, (1989) The Undeserving Poor: From the War on Poverty To the War on Welfare, p. 90. , Pantheon Books, New York; Zarefsky, (1986) President Johnson's War on Poverty: Rhetoric and History, p. xi. , University of Alabama Press, University, AL; Epstein, (1978) The Politics of Cancer, p. 322. , Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, CA; Epstein, (1978) The Politics of Cancer, p. 322. , Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, CA; Price, (1965) The Scientific Estate, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Katz, (1989) The Undeserving Poor: From the War on Poverty To the War on Welfare, p. 90. , Pantheon Books, New York; Miller, Rein, Will the war on poverty change America?
