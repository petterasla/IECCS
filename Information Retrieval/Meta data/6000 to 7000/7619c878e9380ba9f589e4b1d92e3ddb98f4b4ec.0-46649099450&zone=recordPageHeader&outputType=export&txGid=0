The most important causes for concern are not the median projections of future climate change, but the low-probability, high-consequence impacts. Because the policy question is one of sequential decision making under uncertainty, we need not decide today what to do in the future. We need only to decide what to do today, and future decisions can be revised as we learn more. In this study, we use a stochastic version of the DICE-99 model (Nordhaus WD, Boyer J (2000) Warming the world: economic models of global warming. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA) to explore the effect of different rates of learning on the appropriate level of near-term policy. We show that the effect of learning depends strongly on whether one chooses efficiency (balancing costs and benefits) or cost-effectiveness (stabilizing at a given temperature change target) as the criterion for policy design. Then, we model endogenous learning by calculating posterior distributions of climate sensitivity from Bayesian updating, based on temperature changes that would be observed for a given true climate sensitivity and assumptions about errors, prior distributions, and the presence of additional uncertainties. We show that reducing uncertainty in climate uncertainty takes longer when there is also uncertainty in the rate of heat uptake by the ocean, unless additional observations are used, such as sea level rise. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Architectural design; Climate control; Climatology; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Education; Finance; Global warming; Image segmentation; Insurance; Management; Mathematical models; Oceanography; Photoacoustic effect; Probability distributions; Problem solving; Public policy; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Sea level; Stochastic models; Water levels; (n-1) criterion; (R ,s ,S) policy; Bayesian updating; Business media; Cambridge; Climate sensitivity; Economic modeling; Future climate; Policy design; posterior distributions; Prior distributions; Sea level rise; Sequential decision making; Springer (CO); Temperature changing; Climate change; Bayesian analysis; climate change; decision making; environmental policy; global warming; learning; risk assessment; sea level change; stochasticity",,,,,,"Andronova, N.G., Schlesinger, M.E., Objective estimation of the probability density function for climate sensitivity (2001) J Geophys Res-Atmos Res, 106, pp. 22605-22611; Arrow, K.J., Fisher, A.C., Environmental Preservation, Uncertainty, and Irreversibility (1974) Q J Econ, 88, pp. 312-319; Baehr, J., Keller, K., Marotzke, J., Detecting potential changes in the meridional overturning circulation at 26°N in the Atlantic (2007) Climatic Change, , Published online: 10 January 2007 DOI 2010.1007/s10584-10006-19153-z; Brohan, P., Kennedy, J.J., Haris, I., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, P.D., Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: A new dataset from 1850 (2006) J Geophys Res, 111, p. 12106; Church, J.A., Gregory, J.M., Huybrechts, P., Kuhn, M., Lambeck, K., Nhuan, M.T., Qin, D., Johnson, C.A., Changes in sea level,' Chapter 11 (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
