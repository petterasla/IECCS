Some of them, mainly low volume premium brands, have chosen to introduce fairly expensive lightweight materials such as aluminium and magnesium to meet these targets, whereas the main portion of high volume producers are trying to optimize the classic steel concept by introducing different grades of advanced high strength steels. Volvo Cars has decided upon a unique utilization of hot-formed, press-hardened, ultra high strength steel components featuring tensile strength levels in the order of 1 500 MPa, but on the other hand, producing these parts in very thin gauges for weight saving reasons. The first product launched according to this ultra high strength steel intensive concept was the 2008YM version of the Volvo V70 and its sibling, the cross-country version XC70, both built on the EuCD platform. The body contains several parts manufactured by hot-forming and press-hardening. The extensive use of this type of Boron alloyed steel challenged all welding methods commonly used in car body manufacturing, not least, traditional resistance spot welding. This paper will address the following topics: overview of the V70 body structure and utilization of materials, a brief description of the hot-forming, press-hardening process, the procedure for validating weldability before going into series production, lessons learnt from resistance spot welding trials of material combinations involving one or more boron alloyed steel parts, and recommendations for default welding data, influence on the manufacturing system, introducing electro-servo welding guns, adaptive weld timers and ultrasonic non-destructive weld quality checking, necessary revisions of existing spot weld requirements. The presentation will end with a glimpse at perspectives for future welding challenges in Volvo body shops, as the need for further weight saving will promote a considerable introduction of various new grades of advanced high strength steels.","Automobile engineering; Hardening; Heat treatment; High strength steels; Manufacturing; Nondestructive testing; Process conditions; Process parameters; Quality; Resistance spot welding; Resistance welding; Steels; Ultrasonic testing; Welding","Automobile engineering; Non destructive testing; Process conditions; Process parameters; Quality; Resistance spot welding; Automobile bodies; Automobile engine manufacture; Automobile parts and equipment; Automobile testing; Automotive engineering; Boron; Boron compounds; Elastic constants; Fuel consumption; Global warming; Hardening; Heat resistance; Heat treatment; Hydrogen embrittlement; Magnesium; Manufacture; Martensitic stainless steel; Nondestructive examination; Presses (machine tools); Resistance welding; Spot welding; Steel sheet; Tensile strength; Ultrasonic testing; Ultrasonic waves; Ultrasonics; Welding; Welding shops; Welds; High strength steel",,,,,,"Wästlund, C., Structural adhesive bonding in volume series production on the example of the new Volvo S80 (2006) Proceedings Joining Future Lightweight Concepts for Car Body, Chassis and Powertrain, , Bad Nauheim, April; Larsson, J.K., Laser brazing - A new technology for cosmetic joints in the body structure (2007) Proceedings 11th NOLAMP Conference, , Lappeenranta, August; Larsson, J.K., How to meet assembly issues in lightweight and mixed materials scenarios (2006) Proceedings TRANSFAC'06, , San Sebastian, October","Larsson, J.
