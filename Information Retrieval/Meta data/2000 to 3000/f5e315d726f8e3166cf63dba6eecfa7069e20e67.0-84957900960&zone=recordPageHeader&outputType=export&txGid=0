A basic belief of cultural theory is that all societies and their underlying worldviews, irrespective of time or place, must be more or less hierarchic, more or less individualistic, more or less egalitarian, or more or less fatalistic. This approach has a potential for cross-temporal and spatial comparisons that makes it a particularly attractive instrument for a study of the human dimensions of global climate change. However, a significant difficulty in the previous attempts for utilizing cultural theory in integrated assessment models (IAMs) has been the inexactness or uncertainty inherent in both IAMs and cultural theory. In this paper we introduce a fuzzy-based modeling approach that makes use of cultural theory in integrated assessment approach to provide a mechanism for understanding the reaction of a populace to environmental policy decisions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.",,,,,,,,"Risbey, J., Kandlikar, M., Patwardhan, A., Assessing Integrated Assessments (1996) Climate Change, 34, pp. 369-395; Thompson, M., Ellis, R., Wildavsky, A., (1990) Cultural Theory, , Westview Press, Boulder, CO, US; Pendergraft, C., Using Cultural Theory: Environmental Concerns in Texas and Louisiana, , progress; Malone, E., Rayner, S., Thompson, M., Human Choice and Climate Change (1998) National Association of Environmental Professionals, 23Rd Annual Conference, , San Diego, CA, USA, June; Polyani, M., (1962) Personel Knowledge, 322p. , University of Chicago; Van Asselt, M., Rotmans, J., Den Elzen, M., Hilderink, H., Uncertainty in Integrated Assessment: A Cultural Perspective-Based Approach GLOBO Report Series No. 9, RIVM, 71p. , Bilthoven, The Netherlands; Pedrycz, W., Gomide, F., (1998) An Introduction to Fuzzy Sets: Analysis and Design, , MIT Press, Cambridge MA; Dubois, D., Prade, H., (1988) Possibility Theory – an Introduction to Computerized Processing of Uncertainty, , Plenum Press, New York; Mamdani, E., Assilian, S., An experiment in Linguistic Synthesis with a Fuzzy Logic Controller (1975) Int.
