The climate over Kerala also shifted from wetness to dryness within the humid climate (B 4 to B 3) during the study period from 1951 to 2007. There was a shift in cropping systems across the State of Kerala as the index of foodgrain crops was declining while increasing the index of non-foodgrain crops. Unlike in seasonal crops, the effects of climate change on long term basis in terms of global warming may not be seen on crops like coconut, rubber and arecanut as they are grown under tolerable limits of surface air temperature. However, the occurrence of floods and droughts as evident in 2007 (floods due to excess monsoon rainfall by 41% against normal) and summer 2004 (drought due to no significant rainfall from November, 2003 to April 2004), is likely to increase in ensuing decades as projected and crop losses are expected. The unusual summer rains in 2008 devastated the paddy crop in Kuttanad and Kole lands of Thrissur. In contrast, it was beneficial to crops like cardamom, coconut and arecanut. The thermosensitive crops like cocoa, black pepper, coffee, cardamom and tea may need attention as temperature range is likely to increase and rainfall is likely to decline in addition to deforestation as these crops are grown under the influence of typical forest -agroecosystems. Deforestation, shift in cropping systems, decline in wetlands and depletion of surface and groundwater resources may aggravate the ill effects of floods and droughts on all the crops. Hence, there is an urgent need for pro-active measures on short-term and long-term basis against the climate change risks for sustenance of crop production both in terms of quantity ands quality.","Change in cropping systems; Climate change; Climate projection; Food security; Thermosensitve crops","Elettaria cardamomum; Piper nigrum; Theobroma cacao",,,,,,"Hingane, L.S., Rupakumar, K., Ramana Murthy, B.V., Long term Trends of surface air temperature in India (1985) International J.
