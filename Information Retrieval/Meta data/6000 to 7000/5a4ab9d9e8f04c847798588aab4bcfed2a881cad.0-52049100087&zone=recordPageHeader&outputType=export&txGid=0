Because it is free of any carbon compounds and can be produced from alternative sources, hydrogen is an interesting candidate for future ICE-based powertrains. However, the peculiar properties of hydrogen, among those its low density and its very high laminar flame speed, impose specific operating strategies and the adaptation of the conventional research tools. In this context, the 3D CFD models dedicated to combustion and pollutant prediction have to be modified. In the present work, the ECFM (Extended Coherent Flame Model) is adapted to hydrogen combustion through the addition of a new laminar flame speed correlation and a new laminar flame thickness expression. Furthermore, the prediction of the NOx emissions is performed with a modified version of the extended Zeldovitch model. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","3D CFD; Combustion modelling; ECFM; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engine; NOx emission modelling","Alternative fuels; Arsenic compounds; Chlorine compounds; Combustion; Energy resources; Engines; Flame spraying; Flammability; Forecasting; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Global warming; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engines; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Nonmetals; Smoke; Speed; Thermochemistry; Three dimensional; 3D CFD; Carbon compounds; Cfd codes; CFD modelling; Coherent flame model; Combustion modelling; ECFM; Fuel research; Hydrogen combustion; Internal combustion engine; Laminar flame speeds; Laminar flames; Low density; NO<sub>x</sub> emission modelling; Operating strategies; Oxide formation; Research tools; Flame research",,,,,,"Colin, O., Benkenida, A., Angelberger, C., 3D modeling of mixing, ignition and combustion phenomena in highly stratified gasoline eniges (2003) Oil Gas Sci Technol, 58, pp. 47-62; Zeldovitch YAB, Sadovnikov PYA, Frank-Kamenetskii DA.
