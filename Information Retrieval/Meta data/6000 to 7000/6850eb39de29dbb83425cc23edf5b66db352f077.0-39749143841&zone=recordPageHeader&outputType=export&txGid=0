The MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides a 1-km resolution LST product with almost daily coverage of the Earth, invaluable to both local and global change studies. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) provides a LST product with a high spatial resolution of 90-m and a 16-day recurrent cycle, simultaneously acquired at the same height and nadir view as MODIS. ASTER and MODIS are complementary in resolution, offering a unique opportunity for scale-related studies. ASTER and MODIS LST have been widely used but the errors in LST were mostly disregarded. Correction of ASTER-to-MODIS LST discrepancies is essential for studies reliant upon the joint use of these sensors. In this study, we compared three correction approaches: the Wan et al.'s approach, the refined Wan et al.'s approach, and the generalized split window (GSW) algorithm based approach. The Wan et al.'s approach corrects the MODIS 1-km LST using MODIS 5-km LST. The refined approach modifies the Wan et al.'s approach through incorporating ASTER emissivity and MODIS 5-km data. The GSW algorithm approach does not use MODIS 5-km but only ASTER emissivity data. We examined the case over a semi-arid terrain area for the part of the Loess Plateau of China. All the approaches reduced the ASTER-to-MODIS LST discrepancy effectively. With terrain correction, the original ASTER-to-MODIS LST difference reduced from 2.7±1.28 K to -0.1±1.87 K for the Wan et al.'s approach, 0.2±1.57 K for the refined approach, and 0.1±1.33 K for the GSW algorithm based approach. Among all the approaches, the GSW algorithm based approach performed best in terms of mean, standard deviation, root mean square root, and correlation coefficient. © 2007 by MDPI.","ASTER; Land surface temperature; MODIS; Remote sensing; Retrieval algorithm; Scale effects; Surface emissivity; Terrain effects","ASTER; Land surface temperature; MODIS; Retrieval algorithms; Scale effects; Surface emissivity; Terrain effect; Algorithms; Atmospheric temperature; Electromagnetic wave emission; Global warming; Image reconstruction; Landforms; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Radiometers",,,,,,"Karl, T.R., Hassol, S.J., Miller, C.D., Murray, W.L., (2006) Temperature trends in the lower atmosphere: Steps for understanding and reconciling differences, , http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/default.php, Available at; Justice, C., Vermote, E., Townshend, J., Defries, R., Roy, D., Hall, D., Salomonson, V., Barnsley, M., The MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS): Land remote sensing for global change research (1998) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 36, pp. 1228-1249; Yamaguchi, Y., Kahle, A., Tsu, H., Kawakami, T., Pniel, M., Overview of Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) (1998) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 36, pp. 1062-1071; Houborg, R.M., Soegaard, H., Regional simulation of ecosystem CO2 and water vapor exchange for agricultural land using NOAA AVHRR and Terra MODIS satellite data.
