Sandy materials from flood plains and palaeo-lacustrine plains through wind erosion are the main sources of the desert. Cold air intrusions from the northeast of the Tarim Basin are the main form of aeolian motivation. During the past 30 000 years, an arid climate has dominated the desert. However, sand sources and wind conditions affected by ice, snow cover, glacial meltwater and lower evaporation as well as more stable air conditions during very cold periods may have led to temporary decreases in aeolian actions. It is predict that desertification will continue due to the effects of global warming. -Authors",,"aeolian process; arid climate; desert; desertification; sand sea history; China, Taklimakan Desert",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028583825
