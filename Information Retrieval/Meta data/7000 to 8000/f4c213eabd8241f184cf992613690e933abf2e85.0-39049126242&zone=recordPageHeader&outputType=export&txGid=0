Based on spatial and temporal analysis (e.g. monthly, seasonally and annually) of simulated results from ecological process mechanism models of CASA, GLOPEM and CEVSA, the following conclusions could be made: (1) during the last 20 years, NPP change in China followed closely the seasonal change of climate affected by monsoon with an overall trend of increasing; (2) simulated average seasonal NPP was: 0.571±0.2 GtC in spring, 1.573±0.4 GtC in summer, 0.6±0.2 GtC in autumn, and 0.12±0.1 GtC in winter. Average annual NPP in China was 2.864±1 GtC. All the five models were able to simulate seasonal and spatial features of biomass for different ecological types in China. This paper provides a baseline for China's total biomass production. It also offers a means of estimating the NPP change due to afforestation, reforestation, conservation and other human activities and could aid people in using for-mentioned carbon sinks to fulfill China's commitment of reducing greenhouse gases. © 2008 Science in China Press.","China; Model comparison; Net primary production (NPP); Temporal and spatial changes",,,,,,,"(2000) Land-Use Change and Forestry. a Special Report of the IPCC, , IPCC.
