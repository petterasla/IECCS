One critical area of our economy is liquid transportation fuels. This article presents the results of the biodegradability potential of newly developed engineered fuels and compares the results to the biodegradability of conventional fuels and alternative fuels in current use. Biodegradability potential was determined under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Fuels that have a high degree of components derived from renewable sources proved to have a higher degradability potential than those composed of petroleum components.","Aerobic biodegradability; Alternative transportation fuels; Anaerobic biodegradability; Biodegradability screening; Biodegradation; Biomass derived fuels; Fuel biodegradability; Global warming; Green fuels; Renewable transportation fuels","fuel; petroleum; anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; biomass; conference paper; engineering; global climate; greenhouse effect; petrochemical industry; screening; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Energy-Generating Resources; Environmental Pollution; Ethanol; Fuel Oils; Gasoline; Oxygen; Transportation",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Ethanol, 64-17-5; Fuel Oils; Gasoline; Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Doggett, T., (1998) Infoseek, , January 16; Preining, O., (1993) World Resour.
