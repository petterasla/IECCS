However, they may be threatened by human activities and global climate change. These wetlands are often located in remote, biogeographically isolated locations at high elevations. One of the largest of these wetlands - the peatlands within the Cranberry Glades Botanical Area - was assessed for meadow-forest ecotone characteristics. The Cranberry Glades have been reported to be infilling with trees from the surrounding forest, but little research has been conducted on the patterns of tree growth within the moss-dominated communities. Tree establishment patterns were analyzed in regard to location within the ecotone, hummock/hollow topography, and soil conditions by recording the growing conditions of 1389 trees located within nine, 10 × 100. m belt transects. The results indicated that tree growth within the ecotone occurred in decreasing density from the forest to the meadow interior, and much of the tree establishment occurred in tree islands (80% of trees were found in tree islands). Significantly more trees (92%) were also found on hummocks than hollows (8%), likely in response to the greater distance from the water table that the hummocks provide. Most soil properties did not vary significantly across the ecotone or in association with topography. The results add to the minimal literature on southern peatlands and may assist in peatland restoration and conservation efforts. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Appalachian Mountains; Cranberry Glades; Ecotones; Mountain wetlands; Peatlands","climate change; conservation management; dominance; ecotone; growth response; human activity; meadow; montane forest; moss; mountain region; peatland; restoration ecology; topography; water table; wetland; Appalachians; Bryophyta; Vaccinium macrocarpon",,,,,,"Almquist-Jacobson, H., Foster, D.R., Toward an integrated model for raised-bog development: theory and field evidence (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 2503-2516; Barry, R.G., Mountain climatology and past and potential future climate changes in mountain regions: a review (1992) Mountain Research and Development, 12, pp. 71-86; Bedford, B.L., Walbridge, M.R., Aldous, A., Patterns in nutrient availability and plant diversity of temperate North American wetlands (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 2151-2169; Bekker, M.F., Positive feedback between tree establishment and patterns of subalpine forest advancement, Glacier National Park, Montana, U.S.A (2005) Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, 37, pp. 97-107; Brady, N.C., Weil, R.R., (2008) The Nature and Properties of Soils, , Pearson Education, Inc., New Jersey; Braun, E.L., Development of the deciduous forests of eastern North America (1947) Ecological Monographs, 17, pp. 211-219; Brooks, A.B., Cranberry Glades (1911) West Virginia Geological Survey, 5, pp. 358-368; Butler, D.R., (1995) Zoogeomorphology: Animals as Geomorphic Agents, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Butler, D.R., Malanson, G.P., The geomorphic influences of beaver dams and failures of beaver dams (2005) Geomorphology, 71, pp. 48-60; Byers, E.A., Vanderhorst, J.P., Streets, B.P., (2007) Classification and Conservation Assessment of High Elevation Wetland Communities in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia, , West Virginia Natural Heritage Program, 4 December 2007; Callaway, R.M., Facilitative and interfering effects of Arthrocnemum subterminale on winter annuals (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 681-686; Callaway, R.M., (2007) Positive Interactions and Interdependence in Plant Communities, , Springer, The Netherlands Dordrecht; Callaway, R.M., Walker, L.R., Competition and facilitation: a synthetic approach to interactions in plant communities (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1958-1965; Chapin, F.S., The mineral nutrition of wild plants (1980) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 11, pp. 233-260; Clarkson, R.B., The vascular flora of the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia (1966) Castanea, 31, pp. 1-119; Clarkson, R.B., (1993) Destruction of the Upland Forests by Lumbering and Fire, pp. 35-46. , McClain Printing Company, Parsons, WV, Upland forests of West Virginia, S.L.
