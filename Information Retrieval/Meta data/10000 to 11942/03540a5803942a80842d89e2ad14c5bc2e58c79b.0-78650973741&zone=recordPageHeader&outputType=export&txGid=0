Data on coal mine methane emissions from the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety of China has been analyzed. It is estimated that the methane emission from coal mining in China reached 20 billions of cubic meters in 2008, most of which comes from state-owned coal mines with high-gas content. China releases six times as much of methane from coal mines as compared to the United States. However, Chinese methane emission from coal production accounts for only a very small proportion on the environmental impact when compared to emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption. The Chinese government has shown environmental awareness and resolution on the mitigation and utilization of coal mine methane emissions. Measures have been taken to implement the programs of mitigation and utilization of coal mine methane, and at the same time, to ensure mining safety. Nearly 7.2 billions of cubic meters of methane were drained from the coal mines, and 32% of it was utilized in 2008. The slow advancement of technologies for the drainage and utilization of low-concentration methane from ventilation air hinders the progress of mitigation of atmospheric methane and the utilization of coal mine methane emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Coal mine methane; Global climate change; Greenhouse gas; Methane emission","Atmospheric methanes; China; Chinese Government; Coal mine methane; Coal mine safety; Coal mining; Coal production; Economic development; Environmental awareness; Gas content; Global climate changes; Low concentrations; Methane emission; Methane emissions; Mining safety; State administration; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal industry; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Mining; Coal mines; carbon emission; climate change; coal mine; coal mining; environmental impact; fuel consumption; global change; greenhouse gas; methane; safety; China",,,,,,"Bibler, C., Marshall, J., Pilcher, R., Status of worldwide coal mine methane emissions and use (1998) Int.
