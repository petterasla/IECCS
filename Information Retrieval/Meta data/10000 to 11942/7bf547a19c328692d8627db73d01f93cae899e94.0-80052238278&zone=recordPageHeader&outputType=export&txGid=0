It can affect estimates of sea level acceleration, in particular for tide gauge records with lengths of less than 60 years. We provide an analytic solution that shows the effect of the nodal tide on estimates of sea level trend and acceleration. By adding a term to the least squares formulation used to estimate sea level trend and acceleration, we can account for the nodal tide and eliminate its effect on the estimate. Using representative world-wide tide gauge records, we demonstrate that accounting for the nodal tide can improve estimates, particularly of acceleration. © 2011, the Coastal Education & Research Foundation (CERF).","Global climate change; nodal tide; sea level rise","acceleration; climate change; estimation method; sea level change; tidal cycle; tide gauge",,,,,,"Araujo, I.G., De, B., (2005) Sea Level Variability: Examples from the Atlantic Coast of Europe, p. 216. , http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/41361/, Southampton U.K.: University of Southampton Faculty of Engineering Science and Mathematics School of Ocean and Earth Science Doctoral thesis accessed May 9 2011; Cherniawsky, J.Y., Foreman, M.G.G., Kang, S.K., Scharroo, R., Eert, A.J., 18.6-year lunar nodal tides from altimeter data (2010) Continental Shelf Research, 30, pp. 575-587; Church, J.A., White, N.J., 20th century acceleration in global sea-level rise (2006) Geophysical Research Letters, 33, pp. L01602. , 10.1029/2005GL024826 accessed May 9 2011; Ding, X., Chao, J., Zheng, D., Chen, Y., Long-term sea-level changes in Hong Kong from tide-gauge records (2001) Journal of Coastal Research, 17 (3), pp. 749-754; Douglas, B.C., Global sea level acceleration (1992) Journal of Geophysical Research, 97 (C8), pp. 12699-12706; Draper, N.R., Smith, H., (1981) Applied Regression Analysis, , New York: Wiley -Interscience; Holgate, S.J., On the decadal rates of sea level change during the twentieth century (2007) Geophysical Research Letters, 34, pp. L01602. , 1029/2006GL028492 accessed May 9 2011; Hollebrandse, F.A.P., (2005) Temporal Development of the Tidal Range in the Southern North Sea, p. 95. , http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/live/binaries/4de0d195-5207-4e67-84bb- 455c5403ae47/doc/2005Hollebrandse.pdf, Delft The Netherlands: Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences Delft University of Technology Doctoral thesis accessed May 9 2011; Iz, B., How do unmodeled systematic mean sea level variations affect long-term sea level trend estimates from tide gauge data (2006) Journal of Geodesy, 80 (1), pp. 40-46; Jevrejeva, S., Moore, J.C., Grinsted, A., Woodworth, P.L., Recent global sea level acceleration started over 200 years ago (2008) Geophysical Research Letters, 35, pp. L08715. , 10.1029/2008GL033611 accessed May 9 2011; Kaye, C.A., Stuckey, G.W., Nodal tidal cycle of 18.6 yr: Its importance in sea-level curves of the east coast of the united states and its value in explaining long-term sea-level changes (1973) Geology, 1 (3), pp. 141-144; Lisitzin, E., The tidal cycle of 18.6 years in the oceans (1956) Journal du Conseil Permanent International pour lExploration de la Mer, 22 (2), pp. 147-151; Lisitzin, E., (1974) Sea-Level Changes, 8, p. 286. , Amsterdam: Elsevier Oceanographic Series Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company; Orford, J., Murdy, J., Freel, R., 20th century sea-level changes around the north of ireland (2003) Environment and Heritage Service Research and Development Series No. 06/12, , http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/sea-level-changes_amended.pdf, Belfast Northern Ireland: School of Geography Queens University accessed May 9 2011; Proudman, J., The condition that a long-period tide shall follow the equilibrium-law (1960) Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, 3 (2), pp. 244-249; Pugh, D.T., (1987) Tides Surges and Mean Sea-Level, , http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/19157/, New York: John Wiley & Sons Ltd accessed May 9 2011; Rossiter, J.R., An analysis of annual sea level variations in European waters (1967) Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, 12 (3), pp. 259-299; Schureman, P., Manual of harmonic analysis and prediction of tides (1941) Coast and Geodetic Survey, , Special Publication No. 98 U.S. Department of Commerce Washington DC: U.S. Government Printing Office; Sturges, W., Hong, B.G., Decadal variability of sea level 2001 (2001) Sea Level Rise, , Ch 7.
