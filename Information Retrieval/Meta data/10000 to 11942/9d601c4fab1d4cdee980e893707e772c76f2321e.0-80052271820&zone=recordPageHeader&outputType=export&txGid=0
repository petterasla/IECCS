This paper reports an evaluation of many individual runs of AR4 models in the simulation of past global mean temperature. We find that most of the individual model runs fail to reproduce the MDV of past climate, which may have led to the overestimation of the projection of global warming for the next 40 years or so. Based on such an evaluation, we propose an alternative approach, in which the MDV signal is taken into account, to project the global mean temperature for the next 40 years and obtain that the global warming during 2011-2050 could be much smaller than the AR4 projection. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CMIP3 multi-model; decadal prediction; global warming; multi-decadal climate variability; the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition","Alternative approach; Cast shadow; Climate projection; Climate variability; decadal prediction; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Future climate; Global-mean temperature; Individual models; Intergovernmental panel; Multi-model; Natural factors; Quantitative estimates; Surface air temperatures; Climatology; Computer simulation; Global warming; Uncertainty analysis; Climate models; air temperature; climate change; climate modeling; climate variation; decadal variation; ensemble forecasting; global warming; surface temperature; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,"(2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
