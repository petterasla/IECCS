Specifically, the communication of climate change from scientists and policy-makers to the public via the mass media has been a subject of major interest because of its implications for creating national variation in public understanding of a global environmental issue. However, to date, no study has assessed the situation in India. As one of the major emerging economies, and so one of the major greenhouse gas emitters, India is a key actor in the climate change story. This study analyses the four major, national circulation English-language newspapers to quantify and qualify the frames through which climate change is represented in India. The results strongly contrast with previous studies from developed countries; by framing climate change along a 'risk-responsibility divide', the Indian national press set up a strongly nationalistic position on climate change that divides the issue along both developmental and postcolonial lines. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Developed countries; Emerging economies; Environmental issues; Key Actors; Mass media; Policy makers; Public understanding; Greenhouse gases; Global warming; environmental issue; global climate; global warming; greenhouse gas; mass media; media role; policy making; science and technology; India",,,,,,"Adams, W.M., Mulligan, M., (2003) Decolonising Nature, , 1st edn., London: Earthscan; Agarwal, A., Narain, S., (1991) Global Warming in an Unequal World: A Case of Environmental Colonialism, , New Delhi: Centre for Science and Environment; Ananthapadmanabhan, G., Srinivas, K., Gopal, V., (2007) Hiding behind the Poor: A Report by Greenpeace on Climate Injustice in India, , New Delhi: Greenpeace; Antilla, L., Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change.
