For the Tibetan Plateau as a whole potential evapotranspiration (PET) has decreased in all seasons. The average annual evapotranspiration rate decreased by 13.1 mm/decade or 2.0% of the annual total. Superimposed on this general decline are fluctuations ranging from app. 600 to 700 mm with above average rates in the 1970s and 1980s. On a regional basis, spatial trend distributions remain stable throughout the year with similar seasonal variations. Decreasing PET rates are more pronounced in winter and spring (80% of all stations) as compared to summer and autumn (58% of all stations). Maximum negative (positive) annual rates were recorded at two stations in the southern Qaidam Basin with -79.5 mm/decade (84.8 mm/decade) even though in general negative rates tend to be noticeably higher than positive rates. Changes in wind speed and to a lesser degree relative humidity were found to be the most important meteorological variables affecting PET trends on the Tibetan Plateau while changes in sunshine duration played an insignificant role. Stable daytime temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau have limited the importance of temperature trends for changes of PET rates. Negative evapotranspiration trends are therefore thought to be linked to a general decrease in intensity of the regional monsoon circulation rather than to reductions in sunshine duration. Reduced PET rates appear to be in contrast to a predicted increased hydrological cycle under global warming scenarios. © Springer 2006.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Earth atmosphere; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Pattern recognition; Hydrological cycle; Meteorological variables; Monsoon circulation; Temperature trends; Climate change; annual variation; climate change; global warming; hydrological cycle; Penman-Monteith equation; plateau; potential evapotranspiration; relative humidity; seasonal variation; time series analysis; wind velocity; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,,,,,"Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., Crop evapotranspiration (1998) FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56, , Food and Agriculture Organisation, Rome; Barry, R.G., (1992) Mountain Weather and Climate, , Methuen, London; Beniston, M., Rebetez, M., Regional behaviour of minimum temperatures in Switzerland for the period 1979-1993 (1996) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 53, pp. 231-244; Choudhury, B.J., Global pattern of potential evapotranspiration calculated from the Penman-Monteith equation using satellite and assimilated data (1997) Remote Sensing of Environment, 61 (1), pp. 64-81; Chase, T.N., Knaff, J.A., Pielke Sr., R.A., Kalnay, E., Changes in global monsoon circulations since 1950 (2003) Natural Hazards, 29 (2), pp. 229-254; Chattopadhyay, N., Hulme, M., Evaporation and potential evapotranspiration in India under conditions of recent and future climatic change (1997) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 87 (1), pp. 55-74; Chen, D., Gao, G., Xu, C.-Y., Guo, J., Ren, G., Comparison of the Thornthwaite method and pan data with the standard Penman-Monteith estimates of reference evapotranspiration in China (2005) Climate Research, 28, pp. 123-132; Cohen, S., Ianetz, A., Stanhill, G., Evaporative climate changes at Bet Dagan, Israel, 1964-1988 (2002) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 3, pp. 83-91; Doorenbos, J., Kassam, A.H., Yield response to water (1986) Irrigation and Drainage Paper 33, , Food and Agriculture Organisation, Rome; Doorenbos, J., Pruitt, O.W., Crop Water Requirements (1977) FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 24, , Food and Agriculture Organisation, Rome; Duffie, J.A., Beckman, W.A., (1980) Solar Engineering for Thermal Processes, , Wiley, New York; FAOCLIM 1.2 (2001) FAO Agrometeorology Series Working Papers 11, , Food and Agricultural Organisation, Rome; Feng, S., Yang, M., Wang, D., New evidence of Chinese climate startup region for Tibet Plateau (1998) Chinese Science Bulletin, 43 (6), pp. 633-666. , in Chinese; Fischer, G., Van Velthuizen, H., Nachtergaele, F.O., Global Agro-Ecological Zones Assessment: Methodology and Results (2000) IIASA Technical Report IR-00-064, , International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria; Flohn, H., Contributions to a meteorology of the Tibetan Highlands (1968) Atmospheric Science Papers 130, , Fort Collins, Colorado, USA; Garcia, M., Raes, D., Allen, R., Herbas, C., Dynamics of reference evapotranspira-tion in the Bolivian highlands (Altiplano) (2004) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 125 (1-2), pp. 67-82; Gong, D.-Y., Ho, C.-H., The Siberian High and climate change over middle to high latitude Asia (2002) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 72, pp. 1-9; Henning, I., Henning, D., Potential evapotranspiration in mountain geo-ecosystems of different altitudes and latitudes (1981) Mountain Research and Development, 1, pp. 267-274; Henning, I., Henning, D., (1984) Die Klimatologische Wasserbilanz der Kontinente, p. 19. , Münsterische Geographische Arbeiten. in German; Hess, T.M., (1998) Reference Evapotranspiration Program, pp. 8-16. , Silsoe College, Cranfield University, Silsoe, UK; Huang, B., Climatic and physio-geographic division of China: Retrospectives and prospects (1986) German-Chinese Workshop 'The Climate of China', , unpublished paper presented, August 11-13, 1968, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany; Huddleston, B., De Salvo, E.A.P., Zanetti, M., Bloise, M., Bel, J., Franceschini, G., D'Ostiani, L.F., Towards a GIS-based analysis of mountain environments and populations (2003) Environment and Natural Resources Working Paper No. 10, , Food and Agricultural Organisation, Rome; (1992) Climate Change Due to the Greenhouse Effect and Its Implications for China, , Hulme, M.
