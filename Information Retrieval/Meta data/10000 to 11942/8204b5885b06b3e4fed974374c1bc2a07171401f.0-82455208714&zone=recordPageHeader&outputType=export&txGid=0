Besides, it is always desirable to have an environmental friendly energy system in order to maintain its natural beauty and prevent the effect of global warming. As the project economics is concerned, it is necessary to indentify the system life cycle cost or Total Net Present Cost, TNPC, of the optimal hybrid energy system, where this also can be analysing by optimization in HOMER. For observing the realistic effect has on power system designed and it economics, it is also important to assess the effect of uncertainty or a change in sensitivity variable such wind speed and fuel price which this can be done by performing sensitivity analysis. © 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All righs reserved.","HOMER; Optimisation; Renewable energy; Stand-alone systems",,,,,,,"Borowy, B.S., Salameh, Z.M., Methodology for optimally sizing the combination of a battery bank and PV array in a wind/PV hybrid system (1996) IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 11 (2), pp. 367-375. , June; Bernal-Agustin, J.L., Dufo-Lopez, R., Simulation and optimization of stand-alone hybrid renewable energy systems (2009) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 13 (8), pp. 2111-2118. , October; Optimal Sizing of a Stand-Alone Hybrid Wind/PV/Battery System Considering Reliability Indices Accompanied by Error Propagation Assessment (2010) International Review of Electrical Engineering (IREE), 5 (2 PART B), pp. 748-775. , March-April; Tankari, M.B., Camara, B.D., Nichita, C., Ultracapacitors and Batteries Integration in Wind Energy Hybrid System - Frequencies Distribution Method (2010) International Review of Electrical Engineering (IREE), 5 (2 PART A), pp. 521-529. , March-April; Analyzing the East Coast Malaysia Wind Speed Data (2009) International Journal of Energy and Environment, 3 (2), pp. 53-60. , June; Silva, S.B., de Oliveira, M.A.G., Severino, M.M., Economic evaluation and optimization of a photovoltaic-fuel cell-batteries hybrid system for use in the Brazilian Amazon (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (11), pp. 6713-6723. , November; Haidar, A.M.A., John, P.N., Shawal, M., Optimal configuration assessment of renewable energy in Malaysia (2011) Renewable Energy, 36 (2), pp. 881-888. , February; Tankari, M.A., Camara, M.B., Dakyo, B., Nichita, C., Power Fluctuations Attenuation in Wind-PV-Diesel Hybrid System Ultracapacitors and Batteries (2010) International Review of Electrical Engineering (IREE), 5 (5 PART A), pp. 2063-2071. , September-October; Zoulias, E.I., Lymberopoulos, N., Techno-economic analysis of the integration of hydrogen energy technologies in renewable energy-based stand-alone power systems (2007) Renewable Energy, 32 (4), pp. 680-696. , April; Strategy for Participation of Wind Power in Power Market Considering the Uncertainty in Production (2009) International Review of Electrical Engineering (IREE), 4 (5 PART B), pp. 1005-1014. , September-October; Sopian, K., Fudholi, A., Ruslan, M.H., Sulaiman, M.Y., Alghoul, M.A., Yahya, M., Amin, N., Zaharim, A., Hydrogen production from combined wind/PV energy hybrid system in Malaysia (2009) 4th International Conference on Energy & Environment World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society~ IASME/WSEAS 2009, , February 24-26, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Lau, K.Y., Yousof, M.F.M., Arshad, S.N.M., Anwari, M., Yatim, A.H.M., Performance analysis of hybrid photovoltaic/diesel energy system under Malaysian conditions (2010) Energy, 35 (8), pp. 3245-3255. , May; Nelson, D.B., Nehrir, M.H., Wang, C., Unit sizing and cost analysis of stand-alone hybrid wind/PV/fuel cell power generation systems (2006) Renewable Energy, 31 (10), pp. 1641-1656. , August; Rohani, A., Mazlumi, K., Kord, H., Modeling of a hybrid power system for economic analysis and environmental impact in HOMER (2010) 18th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering ~ ICEE 2010, , May 11-13, Isfahan, Iran; Hosseini, S.H., Jalilzadeh, S., Jalilvand, A., Bagheri, A., A New Approach for Sub-transmission System Expansion Planning Using Genetic Algorithm (2010) International Review of Electrical Engineering (IREE), 5 (5 PART B), pp. 2343-2349. , September-October; (2004) HOMER Brochure, , http://analysis.nrel.gov/homer, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, (NREL), Available at, Accessed 8 October 2010; Lambert, T., Gilman, P., Lilienthal, P., Micropower System Modeling With HOMER Integration of Alternative Sources of Energy, p. 2006. , In A.
