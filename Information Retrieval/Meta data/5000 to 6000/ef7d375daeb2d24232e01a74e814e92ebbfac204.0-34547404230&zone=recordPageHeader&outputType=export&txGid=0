The result shows that new manufacturing system of Pb-free bronze made by removing Pb from scrap Pb-bronze reduces such environmental impacts as global warming, acidification, energy consumption, resource consumption significantly. Thus, in LCA perspective, the new manufacturing system using a recycling Pb-free bronze is economically superior to the conventional one using virgin materials. © 2007 The Japan Institute of Metals.","Lead-free bronze; Life cycle assessment; Recycle; Scrap bronze","Inventory analysis; Lead-free bronze; Life cycle assessment; Scrap bronze; Acidity; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Scrap metal; Bronze",,,,,,"(2002) Cyuzou Kougaku Binran, p. 397. , Japan Foundry Engineering Society:, Maruzen, Japan; (2002) Cyuzou Kougaku Binran, p. 437. , Japan Foundry Engineering Society:, Maruzen, Japan; Yamada, K., Rochman, N.T., Fujimoto, R., Suehiro, S., Sueyoshi, H., (2001) J.
