Based on these data, the features of the climate change in the investigated region in the past 250 years have first been studied. In the past 250 years, the change trend of climate in this region can be divided into two periods by the year 1860. Both the temperature and accumulation rate display increasing trend before 1860, while after 1860, the decreasing trend of the temperature is obvious but the change of the accumulation rate is not clear. Although both the temperature and the accumulation rate are increasing in the past 50 years, they are not the highest values in the past 250 years. So it is clear that the climate change in this region during this period does not reflect recent global warming.","Accumulation rate; Antarctic ice sheet; Firn core; Temperature",,,,,,,"Li, Z.Q., Primaiy research on the seasonal variations of δ18O, Cl-, NO3 -, Na+ and Ca2+ in the snow and firn recovered from Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica (1999) Chinese Science Bulletin, 44 (24), p. 2270; Zhang, M.J., The primary research on the environmental climatic records of the two snow pits recovered from Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica (1999) Chinese Journal of Polar Science, 10 (1), p. 61; Zhang, M.J., A continuous 250a record of volcanic activity from Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica (2000) Progress in Natural Science (in Chinese), 10 (10), p. 920; Zhang, M.J., Analyzing the climate features in Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica (1999) Geographical Research (in Chinese), 19 (1), p. 60; Dansgaard, W., Stable isotopes in precipitation (1964) Tellus, 16, p. 436; Jouzel, J., Vostok ice core: A continuous isotope temperature record over the last climatic cycles (160000 years) (1987) Nature, 329, p. 403; Isaksson, E., A century of accumulation and temperature changes in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica (1996) J.
