They can therefore play an important role in the global carbon cycle, influencing atmospheric CO2 concentrations if climate warms. We applied meta-analyses to published data to evaluate the apparent effects of temperature on carbon fluxes and storages in mature, moist tropical evergreen forest ecosystems. Among forests, litter production, tree growth, and belowground carbon allocation all increased significantly with site mean annual temperature (MAT); total net primary productivity (NPP) increased by an estimated 0.2-0.7 Mg C·ha-1.yr-1.°C-1. Temperature had no discernible effect on the turnover rate of aboveground forest biomass, which averaged 0.014 yr-1 among sites. Consistent with these findings, forest biomass increased with site MAT at a rate of 5-13 Mg C·ha -1.°C-1. Despite greater productivity in warmer forests, soil organic matter accumulations decreased with site MAT, with a slope of 28 Mg C·ha-1.°C-1, indicating that decomposition rates of soil organic matter increased with MAT faster than did rates of NPP. Turnover rates of surface litter also increased with temperature among forests. We found no detectable effect of temperature on total carbon storage among moist tropical evergreen forests, but rather a shift in ecosystem structure, from low-biomass forests with relatively large accumulations of detritus in cooler sites, to large-biomass forests with relatively smaller detrital stocks in warmer locations. These results imply that, in a warmer climate, conservation of forest biomass will be critical to the maintenance of carbon stocks in moist tropical forests. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Belowground carbon allocation; Carbon cycle; Carbon turnover; Decomposition; Forest biomass; Forest productivity; Global warming; Mean annual temperature; Meta-analysis; Net primary productivity; Soil organic matter; Tropical evergreen forests","carbon; water; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; global warming; net primary production; soil organic matter; temperature effect; article; biomass; clinical trial; comparative study; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; meta analysis; metabolism; physiology; soil; temperature; tree; tropic climate; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Soil; Temperature; Trees; Tropical Climate; Water",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Adams, D.C., Gurevitch, J., Rosenberg, M.S., Resampling tests for meta-analysis of ecological data (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1277-1283; Alexander, E.B., Pichott, J., Soil organic matter in relation to altitude in equatorial Colombia (1979) Turrialba, 29, pp. 183-188; Anderson, J.M., Swift, M.J., Decomposition in tropical forests (1983) Tropical Rain Forest: Ecology and Management, pp. 287-309. , S.
