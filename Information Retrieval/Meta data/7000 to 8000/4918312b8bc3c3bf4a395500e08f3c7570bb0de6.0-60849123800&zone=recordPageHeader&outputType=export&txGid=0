However, in fiscal 2005, Japan's GHG emissions actually increased by 7.8% versus the 1990 level. In Japan, where industry is responsible for about 65% of the national CO 2 emissions related to energy consumption, each sector has organized a voluntary action plan to promote activities to achieve the mandatory goal set by the Japanese government. Also in the electronics and IT sectors, there is a need for further reinforcement of those activities in association with the enhancement of the current voluntary action plan. In fiscal 2007, the Fujitsu Group started its Environmental Protection Program (Stage V) to comply with increasingly demanding laws and regulations. In this program, the Fujitsu Group announced its target to reduce absolute CO 2 emissions related to energy consumption as its continued efforts from Stage IV, within the framework of its activities for global warming countermeasures. Fujitsu's activities in the areas of manufacturing processes and office division, areas which the Group considers to still be the subject for future challenges, are introduced in this paper in addition to the Group's conventional activities.",,"Emission levels; Energy consumption; Fujitsu; Fujitsu groups; Future challenges; Ghg emissions; Kyoto protocols; Manufacturing process; Voluntary actions; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Reinforcement; Environmental regulations",,,,,,"http://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/english/index.htm, Agency for Natural Resources and EnergySato, K., Approach to Energy Conservation Stable Supply of Electric Power by Introducing NAS Battery System- (2003) FUJITSU, 54 (6), pp. 511-516. , in Japanese","Kawaguchi, S.; environmental engineering divisionemail: s.kawaguchi@jp.fujitsu.com",,,,,,,,00162523,,FUSTA,,"English","Fujitsu Sci Tech J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-60849123800
