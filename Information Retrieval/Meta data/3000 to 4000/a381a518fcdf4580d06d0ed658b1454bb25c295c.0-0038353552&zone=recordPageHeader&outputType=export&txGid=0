Starting with the (aborted) 'hot crisis' of the Greenhouse summer of 1988, this paper tries to show why, despite dire scientific warning, advantages in claims-making, and the perceived emergence of strange weather, global warming consistently obtained lesser outcomes. Whereas global warming is a complex and uncertain scientific issue, the ozone hole was associated and resonated with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture. The latter problem not only gave rise to a hot crisis, but was also caught up in a cultural whirlwind-a rapidly evolving and progressive sequence of dynamic and often surprising events that surge through a variety of public arenas with a strong conversational and practical presence. Effectively, ozone loss provided a sense of concrete risk with both strong emotional overtones and everyday relevance for talk and action. Global warming, in contrast, is not amenable to bridging metaphors and did not lend itself to a cultural whirlwind.","Climate change; Hot crisis; Ozone hole; Social construction","global warming; ozone depletion; perception; public attitude; North America",,,,,,"Bernard, H., (1993) Global Warming Unchecked: Signs to Watch for, , Indiana University Press, Bloomington; Bray, D., von Storch, H., Climate science: An empirical example of postnormal science (1999) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 80, pp. 439-455; Clemens, E., Of asteroids and dinosaurs: The role of the press in the shaping of scientific debate (1986) Social Stud Sci, 16, pp. 421-456; Cline, W., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington; Colt, G., The strange allure of disasters (1997) Life, pp. 58-75. , June; Cortese, A., As the earth warms, will companies pay?
