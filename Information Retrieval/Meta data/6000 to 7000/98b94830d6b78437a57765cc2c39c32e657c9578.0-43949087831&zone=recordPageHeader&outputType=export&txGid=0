The presence or absence of sea-ice affects the atmosphere and the ocean, and therefore the climate in many ways. In this study we have used the Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR) brightness temperature data over the Antarctic/Southern Ocean region to calculate the weekly sea-ice extents, during the melting phase from August 1999 to March 2000 to quantitatively estimate the melting rates of sea-ice on a hemispheric scale. Compared to the melting rates based on the seasonal cycle of the solar irradiance, the MSMR-estimated melting rate remains less until the beginning of October and then rapidly increases to its peak value by the end of December. The observed melting rate behaviour indicates that apart from the seasonal cycle of solar irradiance, it is controlled by other mechanisms like the ice-albedo feedback. The present study estimates the feedback factor, response time and acceleration in the melting rate, which are important towards a better quantitative understanding of the future of Antarctic sea-ice variability, and the climate trends in the context of global warming.","Hemispheric scale; Ice-albedo feedback; Melting rate; Sea-ice extent",,,,,,,"Thomas, D.N., Dieckmann, G.S., (2003) Sea Ice: An Introduction to its Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Geology, p. 6. , Blackwell Publishing; Grenfell, T.C., Maykut, G.A., The optical properties of ice and snow in the Arctic Basin (1977) J.
