Natural science has a key role to play in quantifying vulnerabilities of elements of the Earth system and estimating the risks from a changing climate. But attempts to interpret Article 2 will inevitably draw on understanding from social science, psychology, law, and ethics. Here I consider the limits of science in defining climate ""danger"" by focusing on the potential disintegration of the major ice sheets as an example of an extreme impact. I show that considerations of timescale, uncertainty, and learning preclude a definition of danger drawn purely from natural science. Decisionmakers will be particularly challenged by one characteristic of global problems: answers to some scientific questions become less accurate over decadal timescales, meandering toward the wrong answer, a feature I call negative learning. I argue for a precautionary approach to Article 2 that would be based initially on current, limited scientific understanding of the future of the ice sheets. © 2005 Society for Risk Analysis.","Climate change; Global warming; Ice sheets; Precautionary principle; UNFCCC","Climatology; Global warming; Natural sciences; Public policy; Anthropogenic interference; Ice sheets; Precautionary principles; UNFCCC; Risk assessment; ice; climate change; environmental research; risk assessment; accuracy; climate change; decision making; ethics; greenhouse effect; human; law; learning; natural science; policy; psychology; review; risk assessment; sociology; time; United Nations",,,,,,"(2005), http://www.unihamburg.de/Wiss/FB/15/Sustainability/atlantis.htmChurch, J.A., Gregory, J., Changes in sea level (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, pp. 525-582. , J.
