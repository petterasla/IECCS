There were two glacial intervals, a short (about half a million years) Hirnantian one at the end of the Ordovician and a very much longer one which lasted for much of the Carboniferous and the lower part of the Permian. There were also periods of global warming; for example, the late Ordovician (Middle Ashgill) Boda Event immediately preceded the Hirnantian glaciation. Much has been deduced about Palaeozoic climatic variation for about two hundred years, but it is only since the advent of the understanding of plate tectonics in the 1960s that a coherent picture is beginning to emerge of palaeoclimates around the globe. Although the terms themselves are somewhat misleading, recognition of alternating 'greenhouse' and 'icehouse' states provides effective models for global climate analysis, both today and in the Palaeozoic. © 2007 Geologists' Association.","Boda event; Climate; Glaciations; Ordovician; Palaeozoic; Pangaea; Permian","glaciation; global warming; Ordovician; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; Paleozoic; Pangaea; Permian",,,,,,"Bathurst, R.G.C., Diagenetic fabrics in some British Dinantian limestones (1958) Liverpool and Manchester Geological Journal, 2, pp. 11-36; Berner, R.A., Geocarb II: A revised model of atmospheric CO2 over Phanerozoic time (1994) American Journal of Science, 294, pp. 56-91; Berner, R.A., Modeling atmospheric O2 over Phanerozoic time (2001) Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 65, pp. 685-694; Berry, J.P., Wilkinson, B.H., Paleoclimatic and tectonic control on the accumulation of North American cratonic sediment (1994) Geological Society of America Bulletin, 106, pp. 855-865; Beuf, S., Biju-Duval, B., de Charpal, O., Rognon, P., Gariel, O., Bennacef, A., Les Grès du Paléozoique inferieur an Sahara (1971) Publications de l'Institut français du Petrole, 18, pp. 1-464; Boucot, A.J., (2006) Global climates through geologic time, , Harvard University Press; Brenchley, P.J., Carden, G.A., Hints, L., High-resolution stable isotope stratigraphy of Upper Ordovician sequences: Constraints on the timing of bioevents and environmental changes associated with mass extinction and glaciation (2003) Geological Society of America Bulletin, 115, pp. 89-104; Bustin, R.M., Cold-temperate peats and coals: Their sedimentology and composition (1997) Late glacial and postglacial environmental changes, pp. 294-310. , Martini, I.P, ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford; Caputo, M.V., Ordovician-Silurian glaciations and global sea-level changes (1998) New York State Museum Bulletin, 491, pp. 15-25; Cocks, L.R.M., Presidential Address 2005: Where was Britain in the Palaeozoic?
