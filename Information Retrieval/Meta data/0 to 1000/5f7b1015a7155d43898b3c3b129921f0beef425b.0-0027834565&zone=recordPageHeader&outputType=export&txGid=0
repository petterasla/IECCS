We have developed and applied such an approach to production of methanol fuel from woody biomass. The entire approach is detailed, whereby the system was defined, its emissions for its entire lifetime delineated, and the atmospheric warming forcing calculated for that lifetime plus after effects. The results are presented with material and energy balances including ancillary equipment, external energy subsidies and invested quantities. These extend the analysis considerably beyond those possible using the global warming potential (GWP). For wood input of 283 mg day-1, 70 mg of methanol are produced. System carbon dioxide emissions are 3.18 tonne/tonne methanol produced, with another 1.37 mg emitted when that tonne methanol is burned in a vehicle. System energy usage efficiency was 41.2%, and 41.1% with inclusion of energy to construct the system. In essence, more than two Joules of carbon must be produced in wood for every Joule burned in the vehicle. © 1993.","alternate fuels; atmospheric warming; greenhouse gases; Renewable; renewable energy technology; systems analysis","alternative fuel; biomass; climate forcing; greenhouse warming; methanol; renewable energy",,,,,,"Helm, (1990) Energy Production, Consumption, and Consequences, , National Academy of Engineering, National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment (1990) Report prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by Working Group I, , First Edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Houghton, Callander, Varney, (1992) Climate Change 1992, The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, New York, NY; Lashof, Tirpak, (1990) Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate, , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC; Multi-Laboratory Climate Change Committee, U.S. Department of Energy, (1990) Energy and Climate Change, , Lewis Publishers, Chelsea, MI; National Research Council, (1990) Confronting Climate Change: Strategies for Energy Research and Development, , National Academy Press, Washington, DC; U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, (1991) Changing By Degrees: Steps to Reduce Greenhouse Gases, , U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC; The Potential for Renewable Energy: An Interlaboratory Analytic Paper (1990) prepared for the Department of Energy Office of Policy, Planning and Analysis by INEL, LANL, ORNL, SNL and SERI, , First Edition, SERI/TP-260-3674; (1991) National Energy Strategy, , First Edition, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC; U.S. Congress, (1992) Energy Policy Act of 1992, , U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC; Chang, Hammerle, Japar, Saleem, Alternative transportation fuels and air quality (1991) Env.
