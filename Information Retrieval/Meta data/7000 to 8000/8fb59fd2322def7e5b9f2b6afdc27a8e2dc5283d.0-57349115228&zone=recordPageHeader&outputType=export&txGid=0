This study measured levels of hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and neutralizing antibodies against Akabane virus (AKAV) and Aino virus (AINV) for Thoroughbred horses in Korea. Blood samples were collected from 989 racehorses in several provinces, between October 2005 and March 2007. Sera were tested using either an HI assay or a virus neutralization test. Approximately half (49.7%; 492/989) of the horses tested were antibody-positive for JEV. The HI titer against JEV was significantly correlated with racehorse age (p < 0.05). Horses with an HI antibody titer of 1:160 or higher accounted for 3.9% of the animals tested, indicating that vectors transmitting arthropod- borne viruses bit relatively few horses. In contrast, 3.8% (19/497) and 19.5% (97/497) of horse sera collected in March 2007 were positive against AKAV and AINV, respectively. The presence of antibodies against AKAV and AINV may indicate the multiplication of AKAV and AINV in these horses.","Arbovirus; Racehorse; Serosurveillance","aging; animal; animal disease; article; blood; epidemiology; hemagglutination inhibition test; horse; horse disease; isolation and purification; Japanese encephalitis virus; Korea; Orthobunyavirus; Aging; Animals; Encephalitis Virus, Japanese; Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests; Horse Diseases; Horses; Korea; Orthobunyavirus; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Aino virus; Akabane virus; Animalia; Arbovirus; Congiopodidae; Equidae; Japanese encephalitis virus",,,,,,"Clarke, D.H., Casals, J., Techniques for hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition with arthropod-borne viruses (1958) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 7, pp. 561-573; Cybinski, D.H., St George, T.D., Paull, N.I., Antibodies to Akabane virus in Australia (1978) Aust Vet J, 54, pp. 1-3; Davies, F.G., Jessett, D.M., A study of the host range and distribution of antibody to Akabane virus (genus bunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae) in Kenya (1985) J Hyg (Lond), 95, pp. 191-196; Ishibashi, K., Shirakawa, H., Uchinuno, Y., Ogawa, T., Seroprevalence survey of Aino virus infection in dairy cattle of Fukuoka, Japan in 1990 (1995) J Vet Med Sci, 57, pp. 1-4; Konishi, E., Shoda, M., Ajiro, N., Kondo, T., Development and evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for quantifying antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus nonstructural 1 protein to detect subclinical infections in vaccinated horses (2004) J Clin Microbiol, 42, pp. 5087-5093; Konishi, E., Shoda, M., Kondo, T., Prevalence of antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus nonstructural 1 protein among racehorses in Japan: Indication of natural infection and need for continuous vaccination (2004) Vaccine, 22, pp. 1097-1103; Kurogi, H., Akiba, K., Inaba, Y., Matumoto, M., Isolation of Akabane virus from the biting midge Culicoides oxystoma in Japan (1987) Vet Microbiol, 15, pp. 243-248; Kwon, H.J., Jang, B.J., Lim, Y.M., Lee, C.K., Jeon, Y.S., Studies on Japanese encephalitis live vaccine.
