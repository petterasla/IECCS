Box 5466, Aleppo, Syrian Arab Republic","Arguably the most important adaptive criterion in annual crops is appropriate phenology that minimizes exposure to climatic stresses and maximizes productivity in target environments. To date this has been achieved empirically by selecting among diverse genotypes in target locations. This approach is likely to become inadequate with pending climate change because selection is imposed on the outcome (flowering time) rather than the underlying mechanism (i. e. responses to daylength, ambient or vernalizing temperatures). In contrast to the cereals, in legumes the interaction between phenological mechanisms and environmental selection pressure is largely unknown. This paper addresses this shortcoming through photothermal modelling of chickpea germplasm from the world's key production areas using a meta-analysis of multi-environment trials located from 49° N to 35° S. Germplasm origin had significant effects on temperature and daylength responsiveness, the former strongly correlated to vegetative phase temperatures at the collection or development site (r = 0.8). Accordingly, temperature responses increase from winter- to spring-sown Mediterranean and Australian material, and then to north, central & southern India. Germplasm origin also affects the relationship between photoperiod and temperature response. In Eastern Mediterranean material a strong negative relationship (r = -0.77) enables temperature insensitive genotypes to compensate through a strong photoperiod response. Clearly, chickpea evolution has selected for different phenological mechanisms across the habitat range. Given that under the anticipated global warming temperature sensitive cultivars will flower relatively earlier than those responding largely to photoperiod, it is important to exploit this diversity in developing better-adapted genotypes for future cropping environments. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Daylength and temperature responses; Flowering; Grain legume; Habitat characterization; Specific adaptation","Cicer arietinum",,,,,,"Ben-David, R., Abbo, S., Berger, J.D., Stress gradients select for ecotype formation in Cicer judaicum Boiss., a wild relative of domesticated chickpea (2010) Genet Resour Crop Evol, 57, pp. 193-202; Berger, J.D., Ecogeographic and evolutionary approaches to improving adaptation of autumn-sown chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) to terminal drought: the search for reproductive chilling tolerance (2007) Field Crops Res, 104, pp. 112-122; Berger, J.D., Turner, N.C., The ecology of chickpea: evolution, distribution, stresses and adaptation from an agro-climatic perspective (2007) Chickpea Breeding and Management, pp. 47-71. , S.
