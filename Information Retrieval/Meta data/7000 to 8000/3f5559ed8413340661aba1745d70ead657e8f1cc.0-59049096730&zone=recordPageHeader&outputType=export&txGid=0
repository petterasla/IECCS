Franceza Nr 20, Bucharest, Romania","Due to the increased trend of global warming and accompanying natural disasters, which may vary from extreme drought to severe floods in various parts of Europe, specific measures are to be taken from transnational to local levels. Among them, it is worth mentioning to support local authorities in promoting/implementing the concept of sustainable development, in terms of land use and protection of the national heritage and disaster management. Consequently, public information about possible consequences due to natural hazards is highly recommended in economically developed regions with enclosed tourist resorts and specific vulnerable environment. Such an activity can lead to a more precautionary behaviour of the local population and tourists, and, furthermore, to limitation of the damages in case of a natural disaster. A measure of this kind consists of warning panels, posters and leaflets, available in the areas of high vulnerability for natural disasters, advising people living in the very area and tourists to pay attention or even to avoid the dangerous areas, because natural hazards can happen frequendy affecting both environment and infrastructures. In other words, an efficient informational system concerning risks produced by natural disasters is of main importance for local authorities, environmental protection agencies and water management systems. The improvement of the disaster management in the European Union and candidate countries should be based on implementation of lessons learned from previous disasters. The paper presents a dichotomic paradox, i.e. positive versus negative effects of the natural hazards taking into account examples from Romania. Our case studies concentrate on such positive impact that reveals very important archaeological treasures, buried for hundreds years beneath a thick sedimentary cover or at the bottom of shallow waters. Both sites are located in Dobrogea, the antique Scythia Minor.","Cultural heritage; Natural hazards; Romania; Vulnerability","cultural heritage; disaster management; environmental management; European Union; global warming; heritage conservation; local government; natural hazard; shallow water; vulnerability; water management; Eurasia; Europe; Romania; Southern Europe",,,,,,"BAUMANN, H.V., (1976) New arcaheological evidences regarding the origin of the martyrs from Niculiţel, pp. 581-586. , in Romanian, Biserica ortodoxǎ românǎ, Bucuresti, XCIV5-6; BAUMANN, H.V., From Danube to Sea - Historical evidences and Christians architectural monuments (in Romanian) (1977) From Turcoaia to Niculiţel.
