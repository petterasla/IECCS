To minimize its biological impact, it is necessary to make CO2 disperse as quickly as possible, and it is said that injection with a pipe towed by a moving ship is effective for this purpose. Because the injection ship moves over a spatial scale of O(102km), a mesoscale model is necessary to analyse the dispersion of CO2. At the same time, since it is important to investigate high CO2 concentration near the injection point, a small-scale model is also required. Therefore, in this study, a numerical model was developed to analyse CO2 dispersion in the deep ocean by using a fixed mesoscale and a moving small-scale grid systems, the latter of which is nested and moves in the former along the trajectory of the moving ship. To overcome the artificial diffusion of mass concentration at the interface of the two different grid systems and to keep its spatial accuracy almost the same as that in the small-scale, a particle Laplacian method was adopted and newly modified for anisotropic diffusion in the ocean. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd..","Anisotropic diffusion; CO2 ocean sequestration; Low-wavenumber forcing; Moving and nesting grid; Multi-scale ocean model; Particle anisotropic Laplacian method","Anisotropic Diffusion; Low-wavenumber forcing; Moving and nesting grid; Multiscales; Ocean sequestration; Particle anisotropic Laplacian method; Diffusion; Environmental impact; Global warming; Laplace transforms; Oceanography; Optical anisotropy; Ships; Direct injection",,,,,,"(2005), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
