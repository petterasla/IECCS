However, few studies have involved invasive species. The aims of this study were to examine the effect of extreme heating (40/35°C for 30d) on the growth and photosynthesis of an alien invasive species Wedelia trilobata and its indigenous congener (Wedelia chinensis) in South China, and to determine the development of this invasive species and its potential adaptive mechanism. In comparison with W. chinensis, W. trilobata suffered less inhibition of the relative growth rate (RGR) and biomass production due to high temperature, which was consistent with the changes of photosystem II (PSII) activity and net photosynthetic rate (Pn). High temperature caused a partial inhibition of PSII, but the adverse effect was more severe in W. chinensis. Measurement of the minimum fluorescence (Fo) versus temperature curves showed that W. trilobata had a higher inflexion temperature of Fo (Ti), indicating greater thermostability of the photosynthetic apparatus. Moreover, comparisons of absorbed light energy partitioning revealed that W. trilobata increased xanthophyll-dependent thermal dissipation (ΦNPQ) under high temperature, while retaining the higher fraction of absorbed light allocated to photochemistry (ΦPSII) relative to W. chinensis. The results suggest that the invasive W. trilobata has a high thermostability of its photosynthetic apparatus and an effective regulating mechanism in energy partitioning of PSII complexes to minimize potential damage and to retain greater capability for carbon assimilation. These factors confer greater heat stress tolerance compared with the native species. Therefore, the invasive W. trilobata may become more aggressive with the increasingly extreme heat climates. © 2010 The Author(s).","Chlorophyll fluorescence; high temperature; invasive species; photosynthesis; thermotolerance","chlorophyll; light harvesting system; photosystem II; acclimatization; article; biomass; China; fluorescence; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; heat; light; light harvesting system; metabolism; photochemistry; photosynthesis; photosystem II; temperature; Wedelia; growth, development and aging; photosystem II; Wedelia; Acclimatization; Biomass; China; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Light; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Photochemical Processes; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Temperature; Wedelia; Wedelia; Wedelia chinensis; Wedelia trilobata; Acclimatization; Biomass; China; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Light; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Photochemical Processes; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Temperature; Wedelia",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; Chlorophyll, 1406-65-1; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Chlorophyll; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Photosystem II Protein Complex",,,,"Allakhverdie, S.I., Kreslavski, V.D., Klimov, V.V., Los, D.A., Carpentier, R., Mohanty, P., Heat stress: An overview of molecular responses in photosynthesis (2008) Photosynthetic Research, 98, pp. 541-550; Arnon, D.I., Copper enzymes in isolated chloroplasts: Polyphenoloxidase in Beta vulgaris (1949) Plant Physiology, 24, pp. 1-15; Berry, J.A., Björkman, O., Photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants (1980) Annual Review of Plant Physiology, 31, pp. 491-543; Boyer, J.S., Plant productivity and environment (1982) Science, 218, pp. 443-448; Bradford, M.M., A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding (1976) Analytical Biochemistry, 72, pp. 248-254; Briand, J.F., Leboulanger, C., Humbert, J.F., Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (cyanobacteria) invasion at mid-latitudes: Selection, wide physiological tolerance, or global warming?
