We performed simulation analysis of the effects on pricing of emission allowances by including major players such as China and India into the hypothetical global CO2 emission trading scheme according to non-cooperative game framework. In the presence of a negative public good, i.e., CO2, we extended the Lindahl-Bowen-Samuelson condition to include a class of uncertainty typical in climate change policy into utility. By using the result, we explained, with some numerical examples, the welfare effects caused by the changes of factors, such as level of uncertainty, degree of risk averse, asymmetric utility structure, initial allocation among players, based on our model surrounding the bargaining of CO2 emissions allocation games. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 emission allowance; International air cargo; International passenger transport; Lindahl-Bowen-Samuelson condition","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emissions trading; environmental policy; global climate; China; India",,,,,,"Bohm, P., Larsen, B., Fairness in a tradable-permit treaty for carbon emission reduction in Europe and the former Soviet Union (1994) Environmental and Resource Economics, 4, pp. 219-239; Brueckner, J.K., Zhang, A., Airline emission charges: Effects on airfares, service quality, and aircraft design (2009), http://ssrn.com/abstract=1347950, (February).
