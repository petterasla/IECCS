Between March to May the threshold of maximum temperature observed as ≥ 40 °C was considered. While for winter season, a threshold of ≤ 8 °C was used between January and February. Actual number of days with temperature in selected intervals were determined and analysed to study severity of the season. Climatic effects of industrialization in and around Pune on temperature and rainfall have also been explored. Industrialisation at Pune has been found to result in fall in temperature (maximum, minimum and annual), at this location.","Global warming; Maximum temperature; Minimum temperature; Temperature trend",,,,,,,"Adams, R.M., Rosenzweig, C., Peart, R.M., Richie, J.T., McCarl, B.A., Glyer, J.D., Curry, R.B., Allen Jr., L.H., Global climate change and US Agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-224; Baron, W.R., Historical climatic records from NE United States 1640 to 1960 (1992) Climate since 1500, , Bradely R.S. and Jonnes P.D.
