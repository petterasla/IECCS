It places the present (Quaternary) ice age in the context of Earth history and outlines possible causes of ice ages and the scale and style of ice age climate. Milankovitch climate forcing is described and explained as the cause of relatively predictable climatic variations within an ice age (and at other times), and this is followed by an outline of the factors likely to be responsible for short and rapid sub-Milankovitch climate variations that are superimposed on the predictable changes. Finally the anomalous, relatively constant climate of the last 11.5. ka (Holocene) is highlighted and explained in terms of human input of greenhouse gasses into the Earth's atmosphere. © 2010 The Geologists' Association.","Global warming; Ice Age; Milankovitch forcing; Quaternary; Sub-Milankovitch forcing","climate change; climate variation; global warming; greenhouse gas; Milankovitch cycle; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; Quaternary",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., (2000) The Two-mile Time Machine: Ice Cores, Abrupt Climate Change and Our Future, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, USA; Gibbard, P.L., Head, M.J., Walker, M.J.C., And the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (2010) Journal of Quaternary Science, 25, pp. 96-102; Imbrie, J., Imbrie, K.P., (1979) Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery, , The Macmillan Press, London, UK; Jouzel, J., Stiévenard, M., Johnsen, S.J., Landais, A., Masson-Delmotte, V., Sveinbjornsdottir, A., Vimeux, F., White, J.W.C., The GRIP deuterium-excess record (2007) Quaternary Science Reviews, 26, pp. 1-17; Lowe, J.J., Walker, M.J.C., (1997) Reconstructing Quaternary Environments, , Addison Wesley Longman Ltd, Harlow, UK; Oldfield, F., Alverson, K., The societal relevance of paleoenvironmental Research (2002) Palaeoclimate, Global Change and the Future, , Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, K.
