Among 25 species of Ascomycota isolated from leaf litter, nine were able to grow after incubation in a drying oven for 2. h at 100 °C; the spores of two of these species survived 2. h incubation at 110 °C, and one survived exposure to 115 °C for 2. h. The range of thermotolerance among mesophilic fungi isolated from the leaf litter was surprising: filamentous fungi from other habitats, including species that colonize scorched vegetation after fires and thermophilic forms occurring in self-heating plant composts, cannot survive even brief exposure to such high temperatures. It is possible that the exceptional heat resistance of the Indian fungi is related to adaptations to surviving fires. Genetic analysis of the physiological mechanisms of heat resistance in these fungi offers prospects for future biotechnological innovations. The discovery of extreme thermotolerance among common saprotrophs shows that this physiological trait may be more widespread than recognized previously, adding to concern about the evolution of opportunistic pathogens on a warmer planet. The fungi in this study are among the most heat-resistant eukaryotes on record and are referred to here as 'Agni's Fungi', after the Hindu God of Fire. © 2011 British Mycological Society.","Extremophile; Fire resistance; Global warming; Spores; Thermotolerance","adaptation; biotechnology; cohort analysis; evolutionary biology; extremophile; fungus; genetic analysis; global warming; pathogen; physiological response; semiarid region; spore; temperature tolerance; article; Ascomycetes; chemistry; classification; fungus spore; genetics; heat; India; isolation and purification; microbiology; molecular genetics; phylogeny; plant leaf; Ascomycota; Hot Temperature; India; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Spores, Fungal; India; Western Ghats; Ascomycota; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eukaryota; Fungi",,,,,,"Baggerman, W.I., Samson, R.A., Heat resistance of fungal spores (1988) Introduction to Food-Borne Fungi, pp. 262-267. , Centraalbureau vor Schimmelcultures, Baarn, R.A.
