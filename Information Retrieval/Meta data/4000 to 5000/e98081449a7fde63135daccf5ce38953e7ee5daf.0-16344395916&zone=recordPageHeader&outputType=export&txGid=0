The model consists of a northern high-latitude box, a tropical box, and a southern high-latitude box, which correspond to the northern, tropical, and southern Atlantic Ocean, respectively. Restoring boundary conditions are adopted for the temperature variables, and flux boundary conditions are adopted for the salinity variables. This paper examines how the strength of THC changes when the system undergoes forcings that are analogous to those of global warming conditions by applying the equilibrium state perturbations to the moisture and heat fluxes into the three boxes. In each class of experiments, using suitably defined metrics, the authors determine the boundary dividing the set of forcing scenarios that lead the system to equilibria characterized by a THE pattern similar to the present one from those that drive the system to equilibria with a reversed THC. Fast increases in the moisture flux into the northern high-latitude box are more effective than slow increases in leading the THC to a breakdown, while the increases of moisture flux into the southern high-latitude box strongly inhibit the breakdown and can prevent it, as in the case of slow increases in the Northern Hemisphere. High rates of heat flux increase in the Northern Hemisphere destabilize the system more effectively than low ones; increases in the heat fluxes in the Southern Hemisphere tend to stabilize the system. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.",,"Geographical regions; Global warming; Magnetic flux; Mathematical models; Moisture; Oceanography; Perturbation techniques; Saline water; Hemisphere; Thermohaline circulation (THC); Three-box model; Climatology; air-sea interaction; thermohaline circulation",,,,,,"Baumgartner, A., Reichel, E., (1975) The World Water Balance, p. 179. , Elsevier; Boyle, E.A., Keigwin, L., North Atlantic thermohaline circulation during the past 20 000 years linked to highlatitude surface temperature (1987) Nature, 330, pp. 35-40; Bretherton, F.P., Ocean climate modeling (1982) Progress in Oceanography, 11, pp. 93-129. , Pergamon; Broecker, W.S., Thermohatine circulation, the Achilles heel of our climate system: Will man-made CO2 upset the current balance?
