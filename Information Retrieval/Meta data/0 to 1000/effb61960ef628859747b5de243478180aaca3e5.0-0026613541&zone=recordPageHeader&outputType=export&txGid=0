The measured rate coefficients at 298 and 277 kelvin were ∼20 and ∼15%, respectively, lower than earlier values. These results will increase the tropospheric OH concentrations derived from the CH3CCl3 budget analysis by ∼15%. The predicted atmospheric lifetimes of species whose main loss process is the reaction with OH in the troposphere will be lowered by 15% with consequent changes in their budgets, global warming potentials, and ozone depletion potentials.",,"1,1,1 trichloroethane; hydroxyl radical; article; atmosphere; priority journal; atmospheric implication; hydroxyl radical; kinetics; methyl chloroform; ozone depletion; species lifetime",,"1,1,1 trichloroethane, 71-55-6; hydroxyl radical, 3352-57-6",,,,,,,,,,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","Science",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026613541
