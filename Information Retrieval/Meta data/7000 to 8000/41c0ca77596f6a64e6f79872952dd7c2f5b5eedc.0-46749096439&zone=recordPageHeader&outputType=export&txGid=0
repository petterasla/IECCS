This paper suggests a new cost-effective idea to locate a vehicle in public transport domain and compares proposed technique to some of the methods advised previously to find the location of a vehicle. This paper further proposes a framework that is inspired by the thematic layers of a GIS (Geographic Information System). Proposed transportation GIS works as a visualization tool and helps to process spatio-temporal queries. Building such a system will first of all require a strategy to keep track of vehicles in specific public transport, a client interface, and a query processing system to handle spatial and temporal queries put up by the users of the transport system. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
