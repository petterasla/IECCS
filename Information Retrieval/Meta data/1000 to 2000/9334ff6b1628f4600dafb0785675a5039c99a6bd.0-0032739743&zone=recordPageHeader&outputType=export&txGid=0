These scenarios derive from modelling experiments completed by the Hadley Centre over the last four years using successive versions of their coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate model. The scenarios benefit from ensemble simulations (made using HadCM2) and from an un-flux-corrected experiment (made using HadCM3), but consider only the effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The effects of associated changes in sulphate aerosol concentrations are not considered. The scenarios are presented for three future time periods - 30-year means centred on the 2020s, the 2050s and the 2080s - and are expressed with respect to the mean 1961-1990 climate. A global land observed climatology at 0.5°latitude/longitude resolution is used to describe current climate. Other scenario variables - atmospheric CO2 concentrations, global-mean sea-level rise and non-climatic assumptions relating to population and economy - are also provided. We discuss the limitations of the created scenarios and in particular draw attention to sources of uncertainty that we have not fully sampled.","Climate change scenarios; HadCM2; HadCM3; Sea-level rise","climate change; environmental research; global change; man-environment relations",,,,,,"Airey, M.J., Hulme, M., Johns, T.C., Evaluation of simulations of terrestrial precipitation by the UK met office/Hadley centre model (1996) Geophysical Research Letters, 23, pp. 1657-1660; Arnell, N.W., Climate change and global water resources (1999) Global Environmental Change, 9, pp. S31-S49; Bos, E., Vu, M.T., Massiah, E., Bulatao, R.A., World population projections 1994-95: estimates and projections with related demographic statistics (1994) World Bank, , The Johns Hopkins University Press, New York, USA; Bryan, K., A numerical model for the study of the circulation of the world ocean (1969) Journal of Computational Physics, 3, pp. 347-376; Bryan, K., Climate and the ocean circulation.
