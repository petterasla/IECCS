The major research undertaken in the U.S. concentrates on finding the pathogens responsible. This paper suggests an alternative avenue of research a) that as a result of global warming there is a disjunction between bees pollinating cycles and the life cycle of plants b) that understanding changes in ""timing cycles"" as a result of global warming is the key to understanding the disappearance of the bees. It notes that Gregory Bateson argued that any condition of ecosystem collapse would be characterized first by a collapse in its communicative order rather, than from changed physical states. The collapse of bee colonies and demise of other pollinators is a seeming confirmation of Gregory Bateson argument. Honeybees are 'go betweens' in ecosystemic order. It also argues that an appropriate topology of timing cycles and their recursions would enable better visual comprehension of the heterarchical 'pattern which connects', in Bateson's phrase, and prompt awareness of possible catastrophe in human food supplies. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Communication; Don McNeil; Go-betweens in ecosystems; Gregory Bateson; Honeybee-plant recursions; Sterile nectar; Topology of timing cycles","Apis mellifera; Apoidea",,,,,,"Allen, T., Hoekstra, T., (1992) Toward A Unified Ecology: Complexity in Ecological Systems, , Columbia University Press New York; Baluska, F., (2006) Communication in Plants: Neuronal Aspects of Plant Life, , Springer; Bateson, G., (2000) Steps to An Ecology of Mind, , [1973] Chicago: Chicago University Press; Gregory, B., Catherine Bateson, M., (1987) Angels Fear: Towards An Epistemology of the Sacred, , Macmillan New York; Berger, K., Who killed the honeybees?
