Past studies of GS changes in China have largely been based on phenological observations and satellite data, and little attention has been paid to changes in starting and ending dates of GS. Here we examine changes in the thermal GS over China from 1951 to 2007 based on observed daily surface air temperature. Using five indices, trends of three GS parameters, start, end and length, were determined at 114 high-quality stations over China. Our results show large spatial and temporal differences in the GS parameters in China, where the most prominent changes have occurred in northern China relative to southern China. On average, from 1951 to 2007 the GS has been extended by 2.3 days/decade in northern China where most of these changes is due to an earlier onset of the GS in spring (-1.7 days/decade). In southern China, there is an average increase of GS by 1.3 days/decade with 0.6 days/decade earlier onsets in spring. Furthermore, most stations showing significant trends of GS changes are located in northern China. An extended GS in northern China indicates improved agricultural conditions due to warmer and longer GS. However, this effect may be counteracted by changes in the precipitation pattern. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.","China; Climate change; Thermal growing season; Trend","20th century; Agricultural conditions; Growing season; High quality; Northern China; Northern Hemispheres; Phenological observations; Precipitation patterns; Satellite data; Southern China; Surface air temperatures; Temporal differences; Global warming; Atmospherics; air temperature; climate change; global warming; growing season; Northern Hemisphere; precipitation (climatology); satellite data; trend analysis; twentieth century; China",,,,,,"Aasa, A., Jaahus, J., Ahas, R., Sepp, M., The influence of atmospheric circulation on plant phenological phases in central and eastern Europe (2004) International Journal of Climatology, 24, pp. 1551-1564; Abu-Asab, M.S., Peterson, P.M., Shetler, S.G., Orli, S.S., Earlier plant flowering in spring as a response to global warming in the Washington, DC, area (2001) Biodiversity and Conservation, 10, pp. 597-612; (2004) Impacts of A Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, p. 140. , ACIA., Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, New York; Barford, C.C., Wofsy, S.C., Goulden, M.L., Munger, J.W., Pyle, E.H., Urbanski, S.P., Hutyra, L., Moore, K., Factors controlling long-and short-term sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in a mid-latitude forest (2001) Science, 294, pp. 1688-1691; Bootsma, A., Long term (100yr) climate trends for agriculture at selected locations in Canada (1994) Climatic Change, 26, pp. 65-88; Carter, T.R., Change in the thermal growing season in Nordic countries during the past century and prospects for the future (1998) Agricultural and Food Science In Finland, 7, pp. 161-179; Cayan, D.R., Kammerdiener, S.A., Dettinger, M.D., Caprio, J.M., Peterson, D.H., Changes in the onset of spring in the western United States (2001) Bulletin of The American Meteorological Society, 82, pp. 399-415; Chen, X.Q., Hu, B., Yu, R., Spatial and temporal variation of phenological growing season and climate change impacts in temperate eastern China (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 2266-2278; Chen, X.Q., Zhang, F.C., Spring phenological change in Beijing in the last 50 years and its response to the climatic changes (2001) Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology, 22 (1), pp. 1-5. , in Chinese with English abstract; Chmielewski, F.M., Muller, A., Bruns, E., Climate change and trends in phenology of fruit trees and field crops in Germany, 1961-2000 (2004) Agriculture and Forest Meteorology, 121, pp. 69-78; Chmielewski, F.M., Rötzer, T., Response of tree phenology to climate change across Europe (2001) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 108, pp. 101-112; Chmielewski, F.M., Rötzer, T., Annual and spatial variability of the beginning of growing season in Europe in relation to air temperature changes (2001) Climate Research, 19, pp. 257-264; Ding, Y., Ren, G., Shi, G., Gong, P., Zheng, D., Zai, P., Zhang, D., Dai, X., China's national assessment report on climate change (I): Climate change in China and the future trend (2007) Advances In Climate Change Research, 3, pp. 1-5; D'odorico, P., Yoo, J.C., Jaeger, S., Changing seasons: An effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation?
