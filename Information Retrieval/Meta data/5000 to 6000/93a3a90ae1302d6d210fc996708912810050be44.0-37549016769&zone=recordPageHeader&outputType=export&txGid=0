However, R134a has a very high global warming potential (GWP = 1300). Our objective was to evaluate the cooling effectiveness of an alternative cryogen with a much lower GWP, namely liquid carbon dioxide (CO2, GWP = 1). Study Design/Materials and Methods: A thin-film thermocouple deposited on an epoxy skin phantom was used to measure surface temperature (Ts) variations induced by R134a or CO2 sprays. The temperature distribution in the skin phantom was estimated using Ts and Duhamel's method. Impact pressure and noise level of both cryogen sprays were measured with a dynamic sensor and sound meter, respectively. Consumption of both cryogens was also evaluated. Results: For R 134a sprays, Ts was kept almost constant after 15 milliseconds. For CO2 sprays, Ts decreased continuously during the entire spurt of 50 milliseconds. The minimum Ts induced by the CO2 sprays was lower than that induced by R134a when the spurt duration was longer than 35 milliseconds. Numerical simulation shows that CO2 sprays were able to induce very similar temperature reductions in the skin phantom as compared to R134a sprays when the spurt duration and delay time were selected appropriately. R134a sprays induced an impact pressure of 3.6 kPa, as compared to 43.1 kPa for CO2 sprays. The maximum noise level for R134a sprays was 109 dBA as compared to 135 dBA for the CO2 sprays. The R134a consumption for a 50 milliseconds spurt is 67 mg as compared to 225 mg for a CO2 spurt of the same duration. Conclusions: CO2 sprays are expected to have similar skin cooling efficacy as R134a sprays. Although the CO2 consumption is higher than R134a, its contribution to global warming is still much less than R 134a. The effects of varying spurt durations on in vivo human skin and the impact on cutaneous blood flow require further investigation. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Carbon dioxide; Cryogen spray cooling; Global warming potential; Laser dermatologic surgery; Thin-film thermocouple","carbon dioxide; epoxide; article; cryosurgery; film; greenhouse effect; laser surgery; noise measurement; priority journal; skin blood flow; skin surgery; skin temperature; Aerosols; Carbon Dioxide; Cold; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Laser Therapy; Models, Biological; Skin Temperature",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Aerosols; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Fluorocarbons; tetrafluoroethylene, 116-14-3",,,,"Nelson, J.S., Milner, T.E., Anvari, B., Tanenbaum, B.S., Kimel, S., Svaasand, L.O., Jacques, S.L., Dynamic epidermal cooling during pulsed laser treatment of port-wine stain: A new methodology with preliminary clinical evaluation (1995) Arch Dermatol, 131 (6), pp. 695-700; Nelson, J.S., Milner, T.E., Anvari, B., Tanenbaum, B.S., Svaasand, L.O., Kimel, S., Dynamic epidermal cooling in conjunction with laser-induced photothermolysis of port wine stain blood vessels (1996) Lasers Surg Med, 19 (2), pp. 224-229; Waldorf, H.A., Alster, T.S., McMillan, K., Kauvar, A.N.B., Geronemus, R.G., Nelson, J.S., Effect of dynamic cooling on 585-nm pulsed dye laser treatment of port-wine stain birthmarks (1997) Dermatol Surg, 23 (8), pp. 657-662; Chang, C.J., Nelson, J.S., Cryogen spray cooling and higher fluence pulsed dye laser treatment improve port-wine stain clearance while minimizing epidermal damage (1999) Dermatol Surg, 25 (10), pp. 767-772; Fiskerstrand, E.J., Ryggen, K., Norvang, L.T., Svaasand, L.O., Clinical effects of dynamic cooling during pulsed laser treatment of port-wine stains (1997) Lasers Med Sci, 12 (4), pp. 320-327; Chiu, C.H., Chan, H.H.L., Ho, W.S., Yeung, C.K., Nelson, J.S., Prospective study of pulsed dye laser in conjunction with cryogen spray cooling for treatment of port wine stains in Chinese patients (2003) Dermatol Surg, 29 (9), pp. 909-915; Nelson, J.S., Kimel, S., Safety of cryogen spray cooling during pulsed laser treatment of selected dermatoses (2000) Lasers Surg Med, 26 (1), pp. 2-3; Aguilar, G., Majaron, B., Pope, K., Svaasand, L.O., Lavernia, E.J., Nelson, J.S., Influence of nozzle-to-skin distance in cryogen spray cooling for dermatologic laser surgery (2001) Lasers Surg Med, 28 (2), pp. 113-120; Tunnell, J.W., Torres, J.H., Anvari, B., Methodology for estimation of time-dependent surface heat flux due to cryogen spray cooling (2002) Ann Biomed Eng, 30 (1), pp. 19-33; Jia, W., Aguilar, G., Wang, G.X., Nelson, J.S., Heat-transfer dynamics during cryogen spray cooling of substrate at different initial temperatures (2004) Phys Med Biol, 49 (23), pp. 5295-5308; Jia, W., Nguyen, T., Gill, J., Nelson, J.S., Characterization of cryogen spray cooling with thin-film thermocouple (2007) ASME-JSME Thermal Engineering Summer Heat Transfer Conference, , Vancouver, BC, Canada; Ozisik, M.N., (1993) Heat conduction, pp. 195-213. , 2nd edition.
