Fossil energy sources have been split into three categories: oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are highly efficient and cheap. Currently oil is the fastest primary energy source in the world (39% of world energy consumption). Coal will be a major source of energy for the world for the foreseeable future (24% of world energy consumption). In 2030, coal covers 45% of world energy needs. Natural gas is expected to be the fastest growing component of world energy consumption (23% of world energy consumption). Fossil fuel extraction and conversion to usable energy has several environmental impacts. They could be a major contributor to global warming and greenhouse gases and a cause of acid rain; therefore, expensive air pollution controls are required.","Consumption; Environmental impacts; Fossil fuels; Production; Reserves; Use","Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Energy requirements; Fossil energy resources; Usable energy; World energy consumption; Fossil fuels",,,,,,"Anderson, K., McKibbin, W.J., Reducing Coal Subsidies and Trade Barriers: Their Contribution to Greenhouse Gas Abatement (1997) CIES Seminar, pp. 97-107; Balat, M., Balat, H., Acici, N., Environmental issues relating to greenhouse carbon dioxide emissions in the world (2003) Energy Exploration and Exploitation, 21, pp. 457-473; Balat, M., Ayar, G., Turkey's coal reserves, potential trends and pollution problems of Turkey (2004) Energy Exploration and Exploitation, 22, pp. 71-81; (2002), BP Statistical Review of World EnergyBarnwal, B.K., Sharma, M.P., Prospects of biodiesel production from vegetable oils in India (2005) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 9, pp. 363-378; Demirbas, A., Recent advances in biomass conversion technologies (2000) Energy Education Science and Technology, 6, pp. 19-40; Demirbas, A., Energy and environmental issues relating to greenhouse gas emissions in Turkey (2003) Energy Convers.
