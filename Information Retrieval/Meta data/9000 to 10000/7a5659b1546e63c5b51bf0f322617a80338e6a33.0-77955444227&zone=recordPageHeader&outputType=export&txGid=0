First, we determined that introduced species tolerated significantly higher temperatures than natives, suggesting that climate change will have a disproportionately negative impact on native species. Second, we assessed the temperature dependence of survival and growth by exposing juveniles to an ambient control temperature and increased temperatures predicted by ocean warming scenarios (+3°C and +4.5°C) in laboratory mesocosms. We found that responses differed between species, species origins, and demographic processes. Based on the temperature tolerance, survival, and growth results, we predict that, as ocean temperatures increase, native species will decrease in abundance, whereas introduced species are likely to increase in this system. Facilitation of invasions by climate change may already be underway; locally, invasive dominance has increased concurrent with ocean warming over the past;40 years. We suggest that the effects of climate change on communities can occur via both direct impacts on the diversity and abundance of native species and indirect effects due to increased dominance of introduced species. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bodega Bay, California, USA; Bryozoan; Climate change; Community ecology; Fouling community; Global warming; Introduced species; Invasion; Nonindigenous species; Survival; Temperature; Tunicate","abundance; biological invasion; bryozoan; community composition; community response; dominance; fouling; global warming; high temperature; invasive species; juvenile; laboratory method; marine environment; mesocosm; native species; survival; tolerance; animal; article; Bryozoa; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; Hydrozoa; physiology; population migration; sea; season; ship; United States; Urochordata; Bryozoa; Hydrozoa; physiology; Urochordata; Animal Migration; Animals; Bryozoa; California; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Hydrozoa; Oceans and Seas; Seasons; Ships; Urochordata; Bodega Harbor; California; United States; Bryozoa; Animal Migration; Animals; Bryozoa; California; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Hydrozoa; Oceans and Seas; Seasons; Ships; Urochordata",,,,,,"Boyd, M.J., Fouling community structure and development in Bodega Harbor, California (1972) Dissertation, , University of California, Berkeley, California, USA; Braby, C.E., Somero, G.N., Following the heart: Temperature and salinity effects on heart rate in native and invasive species of blue mussels (genus Mytilus) (2006) Journal of Experimental Biology, 209, pp. 2554-2566; Bullard, S.G., The colonial ascidian Didemnum sp.
