The results are analyzed considering the vertically integrated moisture transport in the lower atmosphere and the moisture flux between the two core areas of South America - the Amazon Basin and the La Plata River Basin. In order to analyze the moisture transport east of the Andes, composites of South American LLJs were built based on the wind speed and vertical wind shear following the modified Bonner criteria 1 used to define LLJs. Integrations along the lateral boundaries of the two basins show that there could be a more intense moisture transport from tropical regions available to feed the mesoscale convective systems in the subtropical La Plata Basin in the IPCC A2 scenario, as compared to the present. This is because of the intense flow to the south associated with a faster LLJ bringing more moisture from the Amazon Basin southwards. It was also observed that the presence of the LLJ affects moisture convergence in the Amazon Basin in the current climate as well as in the warmer climate. In the future high-emission scenario A2, a more intense LLJ in a global warming climate suggests increased moisture transport from north to south east of the Andes as compared to the present. © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Low-level jet; Moisture flux","Amazon basin; Core area; Emission scenario; Intense flow; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; La Plata basin; Lateral boundary; Low-level jet; Lower atmosphere; Mesoscale Convective System; Moisture convergence; Moisture flux; Moisture fluxes; Moisture transport; Regional model; River basins; South America; Special report on emissions scenarios; Time periods; Tropical regions; Vertical wind shear; Vertically integrated moisture transports; Wind speed; Global warming; Jets; Rain; Storms; Moisture; climate change; global warming; Hadley cell; jet stream; moisture flux; wind shear; wind velocity; Amazon Basin; Andes; La Plata Basin; South America",,,,,,"Alves, L., (2007) Simulações da variabilidade do clima presente sobre a América do Sul utilizando um modelo climático regional, , Master Science Dissertation, INPE.
