Most researchers who discuss the effects of such changes on agriculture report estimated yield changes based on crop process models. However, studies focusing on the impact of climatic change on agricultural product markets are very rare. This paper examines the relationship between climatic change and world food markets, i.e., the supply and demand of crops, by using a stochastic version of a world food model, the International Food and Agricultural Policy Simulation Model. The results suggest that variations in the production of maize and soybeans in some major producing countries will be large, and variations in the producer prices of all crops will increase. Countries that suffer higher price risk because of high sensitivity to temperature fluctuations may need to consider changes in cropping patterns. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2009.","Global warming; SRES A2; Stochastic model; World food model","Glycine max; Zea mays",,,,,,"Furuya, J., Koyama, O., Impacts of climatic change on world agricultural product markets: Estimation of macro yield functions (2005) Jpn Agric Res Q, 39 (2), pp. 121-134; Furuya, J., Meyer, S.D., Impacts of water cycle changes on the rice market in Cambodia: Stochastic supply and demand model analysis (2008) Paddy Water Environ, 6, pp. 139-151; Hasegawa, T., Kobayashi, K., Lieffering, M., Kim, H.Y., Sakai, H., Shimono, H., Yamakawa, Y., Okada, M., Impact of increased source capacity on rice yield: Case study with CO2 enrichment (2005) Rice Is Life: Scientific Perspectives for the 21st Century, , In: Toriyama K, Heong KL, Hardy B (eds) International Rice Research Institute, Los Banos and Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences, Tsukuba (on CD); (2007) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) Working Group I (WGI), pp. 69-70. , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Technical summary; Jones, P.G., Thornton, P.K., The potential impacts of climate change on maize production in Africa and Latin America in 2055 (2003) Glob Environ Change, 13, pp. 51-59; Neelin, J.D., Münnich, M., Su, H., Meyerson, J.E., Holloway, C.E., Tropical drying trends in global warming models and observations (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103 (16), pp. 6110-6115; Oga, K., Yanagishima, K., (1996) IFPSIM, International Food and Agricultural Policy Simulation Model (User's Guide), , JIRCAS Working Report no. 1; Parry, M., Rosenzweig, C., Iglesias, A., Fischer, G., Livermore, M., Climate change and world food security: A new assessment (1999) Glob Environ Change, 9, pp. S51-S67; Richardson, J.W., Klose, S.L., Gray, A.W., An applied procedure for estimating and simulating multivariate empirical (MVE) probability distributions in farm-level risk assessment and policy analysis (2000) J Agric Appl Econ, 32 (2), pp. 299-315; Rosenzweig, C., Iglesias, A., Yang, X.B., Epstein, P.R., Chivian, E., (2000) Climate Change and U.S. Agriculture: The Impacts of Warming and Extreme Weather Events on Productivity, Plant Diseases, and Pests, , http://chge.med.harvard.edu/publications/documents/agricultureclimate.pdf, Center for Health and the Global Environment, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.
