S4S 0A2, Canada","Shallow mountain lakes and ponds may function as reference systems for monitoring the effects of global climate change. A survey of phytobenthos and phytoplankton communities was conducted along an altitudinal gradient of Canadian Rocky Mountain lakes and ponds to relate patterns in algal abundance and community composition to catchment and climate-related variables. Algal abundance and community composition were quantified using pigments as analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Regression analyses revealed that the abundance of rock-attached algae (epilithon) was negatively correlated (r2 = 0.54, p &lt; 0.001) to lake elevation, and positively correlated to conductivity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content (r2= 0.52, p(cond.) &lt; 0.03, p(DOC) &lt; 0.01). Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that elevation, conductivity, and DOC were also significant predictors of epilithon community composition. Epilithic diatoms (diatoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, fucoxanthin) declined disproportionately with increasing water transparency and decreasing chemical concentrations. In contrast, patterns in sediment-dwelling algal (epipelon) abundance and community composition were not well-explained by the suite of measured environmental variables. Phytoplankton community composition, but not abundance, was best predicted by zooplankton biomass and elevation as cryptophytes (alloxanthin) were favored in low-elevation, montane lakes and ponds containing abundant zooplankton. Also, elevated conductivity and low DOC content were associated with a compositional shift away from planktonic cryptophytes and green algae (lutein, violaxanthin) towards siliceous algae (fucoxanthin, chlorophyll c) and colonial cyanobacteria (myxoxanthophyll). These comparative results corroborate experimental findings that suggest epilithon is regulated by DOC, inorganic nutrients, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) in alpine littoral habitats. Thus, epilithon appears better suited than either phytoplankton or epipelon as a bioindicator of climatically induced variations in the abiotic environments of shallow mountain lakes and ponds.","Bioindicators; Climate change; Conductivity; Dissolved organic carbon; High performance liquid chromatography; Mountain ponds; Phytobenthos; Phytoplankton","bioindicator; canada; climate change; diadinoxanthin; diatoxanthine; dissolved organic carbon; fucoxanthin; geology; high performance liquid chromatography; phytobenthos; phytoplankton; redundancy analysis; regression analysis; ultraviolet radiation; abundance; bioindicator; climate change; community composition; phytobenthos; phytoplankton; United States",,,,,,"Anderson, R.S., Donald, D.B., Limnological survey of some small lakes in the vicinity of the Cascade Trail, Banff National Park (1978) MS Report, , Canadian Wildlife Service, Calgary, Alberta; Arvola, L., Kanakaala, P., Tulonen, T., Ojala, A., Effects of phosphorus and allochthonous humic matter enrichment on the metabolic processes and community structure of plankton in a boreal lake (Lake Pääjärvi) (1996) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 53, pp. 1646-1662; Barko, J.W., Gunnison, D., Carpenter, S.R., Sediment interactions with submersed macrophyte growth and community dynamics (1991) Aquatic Botany, 41, pp. 41-65; Blumenshine, S.C., Vadeboncoeur, Y., Lodge, D.M., Cottingham, K.L., Knight, S.E., Benthic-pelagic links: Responses of benthos to water-column nutrient enrichment (1997) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 16, pp. 466-479; Blumenthaler, M., Ambach, W., Rehwald, W., Solar UV-A and UV-B radiation fluxes at two alpine stations at different altitudes (1992) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 46, pp. 39-44; Borchardt, M.A., Nutrients (1996) Algal Ecology: Freshwater Benthic Ecosystems, pp. 183-227. , R.
