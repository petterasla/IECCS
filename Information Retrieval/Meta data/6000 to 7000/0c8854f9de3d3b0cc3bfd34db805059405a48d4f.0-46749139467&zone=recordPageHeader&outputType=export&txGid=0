Vegetation was examined in 60 plots of area 50 cm × 50 cm by five environmental factors: water content in the peat and duff layers, groundwater level, slope angle, depth to frozen surface, and presence of pellets and feces. Three palsas were selected for the survey, and the heights were fewer than 50 cm from the groundwater surface. Based on TWINSPAN and canonical correspondence analysis, we confirmed that clear patterns of vegetation zonation had developed within a 60-cm difference in water level. Vaccinium vitis-idaea occurred well on the top areas of palsas, while Carex aquatilis was established on the bottom areas. Sphagnum spp. were established on intermediate locations between V. vitis-idaea and C. aquatilis. The prime determinant of the vegetation zonation seems to be water content in peat and duff layers rather than water level, although the five factors that we examined interact intricately with each other. © 2007 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Ordination; Palsa; Peat moss; Soil moisture","canonical analysis; correspondence analysis; environmental factor; global warming; groundwater; ordination; palsa; peat; refuge; slope angle; soil moisture; survey; topography; vegetation; water content; Alaska; Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; North America; United States; Bryophyta; Carex aquatilis; Sphagnum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Vitaceae",,,,,,"(2005) Background: Weather and Climate Conditions.
