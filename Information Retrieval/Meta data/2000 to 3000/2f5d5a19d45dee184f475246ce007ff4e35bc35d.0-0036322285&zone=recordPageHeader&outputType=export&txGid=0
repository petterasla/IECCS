The mean annual global soil-CO2 flux over this 15-y period was estimated to be 80.4 (range 79.3-81.8) Pg C. Monthly variations in global soil-CO2 emissions followed closely the mean temperature cycle of the Northern Hemisphere. Globally, soil-CO2 emissions reached their minima in February and peaked in July and August. Tropical and subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests contributed more soil-derived CO2 to the atmosphere than did any other vegetation type (∼30% of the total) and exhibited a biannual cycle in their emissions. Soil-CO2 emissions in other biomes exhibited a single annual cycle that paralleled the seasonal temperature cycle. Interannual variability in estimated global soil-CO2 production is substantially less than is variability in net carbon uptake by plants (i.e., net primary productivity). Thus, soils appear to buffer atmospheric CO2 concentrations against far more dramatic seasonal and interannual differences in plant growth. Within seasonally dry biomes (savannas, bushlands and deserts), interannual variability in soil-CO2 emissions correlated significantly with interannual differences in precipitation. At the global scale, however, annual soil-CO2 fluxes correlated with mean annual temperature, with a slope of 3.3 Pg Cy-1 per °C. Although the distribution of precipitation influences seasonal and spatial patterns of soil-CO2 emissions, global warming is likely to stimulate CO2 emissions from soils.","Climate change; Global carbon cycle; Global warming; Model; Soil carbon dioxide emissions","annual variation; carbon emission; climate change; global warming; soil respiration",,,,,,"Andrews, J.A., Harrison, K.G., Matamala, R., Schlesinger, W.H., Separation of root respiration from total soil respiration using carbon-13 labeling during free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) (1999) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 63, pp. 1429-1435; Andrews, J.A., Schlesinger, W.H., Soil CO2 dynamics, acidification, and chemical weathering in a temperate forest with experimental CO2 enrichment (2001) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 15, pp. 149-162; Boone, R.D., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Canary, J.D., Kaye, J.P., Roots exert a strong influence on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (1998) Nature, 396, pp. 570-572; Bremer, D.J., Ham, J.M., Owensby, C.E., Knapp, A.K., Responses of soil respiration to clipping and grazing in a tallgrass prairie (1998) Journal of Environmental Quality, 27, pp. 1539-1548; Caldwell, M.M., White, R.S., Moore, R.T., Camp, L.B., Carbon balance, productivity, and water use of cold-winter desert shrub communities dominated by C3 and C4 species (1977) Oecologia, 29, pp. 275-300; Conway, T.J., Tans, P.P., Waterman, L.S., Thoning, K.W., Evidence for interannual variability of the carbon cycle from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration/climate monitoring and diagnostics laboratory global air sampling network (1994) Journal of Geophysical Research, 99, pp. 22831-22855; Cramer, W., Bondeau, A., Woodwoard, F.I., Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: Results from six dynamic global vegetation models (2001) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 357-373; Crill, P.M., Seasonal patterns of methane uptake and carbon dioxide release by a temperate woodland soil (1991) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 5, pp. 319-334; Davidson, E.A., Belk, E., Boone, R.D., Soil water content and temperature as independent or confounded factors controlling soil respiration in a temperate mixed hardwood forest (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 217-227; Davidson, E.A., Trumbore, S.E., Gas diffusivity and production of CO2 in deep soils of the eastern Amazon (1995) Tellus, 47 B, pp. 550-564; Davidson, E.A., Verchot, L.V., Cattânio, J.H., Ackerman, I.L., Carvalho, J.E.M., Effects of soil water content on soil respiration in forests and cattle pastures of eastern Amazonia (2000) Biogeochemistry, 48, pp. 53-69; DeFries, R.S., Hansen, M., Townshend, J.R.G., Sohlberg, R., Global land cover classifications at 8 km spatial resolution: The use of training data derived from landsat imagery in decision tree classifiers (1998) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 19, pp. 3141-3168; Edwards, N.T., Harris, W.F., Carbon cycling in a mixed deciduous forest floor (1977) Ecology, 58, pp. 431-437; Ewel, K.C., Cropper W.P., Jr., Gholz, H.L., Soil CO2 evolution in Florida slash pine plantations.
