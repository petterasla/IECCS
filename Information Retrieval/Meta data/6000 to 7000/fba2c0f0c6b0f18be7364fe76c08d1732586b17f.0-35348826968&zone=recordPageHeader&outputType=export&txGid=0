In Florida, USA, salinity stress due to increased tidal flooding contributes to the dramatic and well documented decline of species-rich coastal forest areas along the Gulf of Mexico. Here, we present the results of a study of coastal forest stand dynamics in thirteen 400m2 plots representing an elevation gradient of 0.58-1.1;m affected by tidal flooding and rising sea levels. We extended previously published data from 1992-2000 to 2005 to quantify the full magnitude of the 1998-2002 La Niña-associated drought. Populations of the dominant tree species, Sabal palmetto (cabbage palm), declined more rapidly during 2000-2005 than predicted from linear regressions based on the 1992-2000 data. Dramatic increases in Juniperus virginiana (Southern red cedar) and S. palmetto mortality during 2000-2005 as compared with 1995-2000 are apparently due to the combined effects of a major drought and ongoing sea-level rise. Additionally, coastal forest stands continued to decline in species richness with increased tidal flooding frequency and decreasing elevation. Stable isotope (H, O) analyses demonstrate that J. virginiana accesses fresher water sources more than S. palmetto. Carbon isotopes reveal increasing δ13C enrichment of S. palmetto and J. virginiana with increased tidal flooding and decreased elevation, demonstrating increasing water stress in both species. Coastal forests with frequent tidal flooding are unable to support species-rich forests or support regeneration of the most salt-tolerant tree species over time. Given that rates of sea-level rise are predicted to increase and periodic droughts are expected to intensify in the future due to global climate change, coastal forest communities are in jeopardy if their inland retreat is restricted. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Global warming; Juniperus virginiana; La Niña; Sabal palmetto; Salt tolerance; Sea-level rise; Species richness; Stable isotopes; Tidal flooding","carbon isotope; climate change; drought; flooding; global change; global warming; sea level change; species richness; stable isotope; water stress; Atlantic Ocean; Florida [United States]; Gulf of Mexico; North America; United States; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Juniperus; Juniperus virginiana; Juniperus virginiana silicicola; Sabal; Sabal palmetto",,,,,,"Abbott, J.R., Judd, W., Floristic inventory of the Waccasassa Bay State Preserve, Levy County, Florida (2000) Rhodora, 102, pp. 439-513; Ball, M.C., Farquhar, G.D., Photosynthetic and stomatal responses of two mangrove species, Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicennia marina, to long-term salinity and humidity conditions (1984) Plant Physiology, 74, pp. 1-6; Castaneda, H., Putz, F.E., Predicting sea-level rise effects on a nature preserve on the Gulf coast of Florida: A landscape perspective (2007) Florida Scientist, 70, pp. 166-175; Conner, W.H., Brody, M., Rising water levels and the future of southeastern Louisiana swamp forests (1989) Estuaries, 12, pp. 318-323; Cooper, L.W., DeNiro, M.J., Covariance of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions in plant water: Species effects (1989) Ecology, 70, pp. 1619-1628; Coplen, T.B., Reporting of stable hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopic abundances (1994) Pure and Applied Chemistry, 66, pp. 273-276; DeLaune, R.D., Patrick, W.H., Pezeshki, S.R., Foreseeable flooding and death of coastal wetland forests (1987) Environmental Conservation, 14, pp. 129-133; Denslow, J.S., Battaglia, L.L., Stand composition and structure across a changing hydrologic gradient: Jean Lafitte National Park, Louisiana, USA (2002) Wetlands, 22, pp. 738-752; Donner, S.D., Skirving, W.J., Little, C.M., Oppenheimer, M., Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Global assessment of coral bleaching and required rates of adaptation under climate change (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 2251-2265; Ehleringer, J.R., Monson, R.K., Evolutionary and ecological aspects of photosynthetic pathway variation (1993) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 24, pp. 411-439; Epstein, S., Mayeda, T., Variations of O18 content of water from natural sources (1953) Geochimica Et Cosmochimica Acta, 42, pp. 213-224; Farquhar, G.D., Richards, R., Isotopic composition of plant carbon correlates with water use efficiency of wheat genotypes (1984) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 11, pp. 539-552; Goodbred, S.L., Wright, E.E., Hine, A.C., Sea-level change and storm-surge deposition in a late Holocene Florida salt marsh (1998) Journal of Sedimentary Research, 68, pp. 240-252; Ish-Shalom, N., Sternberg, L., Ross, M., Water utilization of tropical hardwood hammocks of the Lower Florida Keys (1992) Oecologia, 92, pp. 108-112; Jokiel, P.L., Brown, E.K., Global warming, regional trends and inshore environmental conditions influence coral bleaching in Hawaii (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 1627-1641; Meehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Collins, W.D., How much more global warming and sea level rise?
