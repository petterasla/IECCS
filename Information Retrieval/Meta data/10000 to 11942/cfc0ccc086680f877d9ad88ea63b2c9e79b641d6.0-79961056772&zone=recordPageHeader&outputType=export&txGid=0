One way to decrease the time required to cross the fringing reef is to maximize swimming speed. We found that both water temperature and nest temperature influence swimming performance of hatchling green turtles, but in opposite directions. Warm water increases swimming ability, with hatchling turtles swimming in warm water having a faster stroke rate, while an increase in nest temperature decreases swimming ability with hatchlings from warm nests producing less thrust per stroke. © 2011 Booth, Evans.",,"animal; article; body size; greenhouse effect; physiology; swimming; temperature; turtle; coral reef; environmental temperature; hatchling; incubation temperature; nesting; nonhuman; predation; velocity; water temperature; Animals; Body Size; Global Warming; Swimming; Temperature; Turtles; Anthozoa; Cheloniidae; Testudines",,,,,,"IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2010), www.iucnredlist.org, IUCN, Version 2010.4.
