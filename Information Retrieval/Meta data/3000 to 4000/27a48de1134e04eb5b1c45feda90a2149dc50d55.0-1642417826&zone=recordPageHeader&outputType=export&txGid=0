The systems studied were the electric showerhead, the passage gas heater and the solar heater. The water heating systems can pollute the environment through the emission of greenhouse gases which occurs during the generation of electric power for manufacturing the components of these systems and the use of the electric showerheads and resistances of the boilers of the solar systems, and during the combustion of fossil fuels gas heaters and transport of the heating system's components. The results show that, for the adopted parameters, the electric showerhead consumes the most electric power and emits the most pollutants during its life cycle. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
