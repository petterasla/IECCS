An empirical model was created for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide for both uplands and paddy rice using monitoring data from 22 fields. The greenhouse gas emissions were converted into GWP, whereas yield and FSN were obtained from interviews with farmers and a literature survey. Land use distribution was obtained by ground surveys in 2002, 2005 and 2007. The analysis showed that paddy rice and soybeans were characterized by a high GWP, low FSN and high income, whereas onions and vegetables had a high FSN but low GWP and moderate income. Wheat showed a negative GWP in some years, and abandoned areas always exhibited negative values. The total GWPs for the region were 14,184, 11,085 and 8,337 Mg CO2 year-1 for 2002, 2005 and 2007, respectively. The contribution of paddy rice to GWP was highest, ranging from 40 to 75%. To find optimal land use combinations that provide higher incomes and lower GWPs and FSNs than at present, all possible land use combinations were analyzed by changing the land use proportion from 0 to 100% at an interval of 10%. The number of land use combinations meeting the requirements in the three investigated years was 205. Abandoned area, which had the smallest environmental load, was included in every land use combination, indicating that land uses with low environmental impacts should be maintained at a certain proportion to mitigate the environmental load accompanying land uses with high production. © 2009 Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science, United Nations University, and Springer.","Eco-balance; Farmland soil; Farmland surplus nitrogen; Global warming potential; Land use","Allium cepa; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Fortuna, A., Harwood, R., Kizilkaya, K., Paul, E.A., Optimizing nutrient availability and potential carbon sequestration (2003) Soil Biol Biochem, 35, pp. 1005-1013; Franzluebbers, A.J., Haney, R.L., Honeycuttc, C.W., Arshad, M.A., Schomberg, H.H., Hons, F.M., Climatic influences on active fractions of soil organic matter (2001) Soil Biol Biochem, 33, pp. 1103-1111; Freibauer, A., Regionalised inventory of biogenic greenhouse gas emissions from European agriculture (2003) Eur J Agron, 19, pp. 135-160; Gu, J.X., Zheng, X.H., Wang, Y.H., Ding, W.X., Zhu, B., Chen, X., Wang, Y.Y., Zhu, J., Regulatory effects of soil properties on background N2O emissions from agricultural soils in China (2007) Plant Soil, 295, pp. 53-65; Kimura, S.D., Hatano, R., An Eco-Balance approach to evaluate the historical change in N loads caused by agricultural land use change at a regional scale (2007) Agric Syst, 94, pp. 165-176; Kimura, S.D., Liang, L., Hatano, R., Influence of long-term changes in nitrogen flows on the environment: A case study of a city in Hokkaido, Japan (2004) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 70, pp. 271-282; Kimura, S.D., Mu, Z.-J., Toma, Y., Hatano, R., An eco-balance analysis of global warming potential, farmland surplus nitrogen and yield of six agricultural land uses in the Ikushunbetsu Watershed (2007) Soil Sci Plant Nutr, 53, pp. 373-386; Kimura, S.D., Hatano, R., Okazaki, M., Characteristics and issues related to regional-scale modeling of nitrogen flows (2009) Soil Sci Plant Nutr, 55, pp. 1-12; Kusa, K., Sawamoto, T., Hatano, R., Nitrous oxide emissions for 6 years from a gray lowland soil cultivated with onions in Hokkaido, Japan (2002) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 63, pp. 239-247; Liu, Q.P., Lin, Z.S., Feng, N.H., Liu, Y.M., A modified model of ecological footprint accounting and its application to cropland in Jiangsu, China (2008) Pedosphere, 18, pp. 154-162; Mallory, E.B., Porter, G.A., Potato yield stability under contrasting soil management strategies.
