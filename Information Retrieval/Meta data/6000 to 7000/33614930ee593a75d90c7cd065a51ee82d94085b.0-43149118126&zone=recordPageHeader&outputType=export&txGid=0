Another possible, more insidious effect of global climate change is the expansion of the endemic range of disease vectors, including mosquitoes and ticks. In veterinary medicine, this may translate to an increased number of cases of tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, in geographic areas that were traditionally thought not to harbor ticks. Therefore, technicians should educate owners about the increasing prevalence of these types of diseases and monitor patients for clinical signs of infection.",,"Ixodida",,,,,,"Lindgren, E., Jaenson, T.G., (2006) Lyme Borreliosis in Europe: Influences of Climate and Climate Change, Epidemiology, Ecology, and Adaptation Measures, , Geneva, World Health Organization; Littman, M.P., Canine borreliosis (2003) Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract, 33 (4), pp. 827-862; Littman, M.P., Goldstein, R.E., Labato, M.A., ACVIM small animal consensus statement on Lyme disease in dogs: Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention (2006) J Vet Intern Med, 20 (2), pp. 422-434; Lyme disease - United States, 2003-2005 (2007) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 56 (23), pp. 573-576. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Global Warming Basics, , www.pewclimate.org/global-warming-basics, Pew Center for Global Climate Change:, Accessed March 2008 at; McCabe, G.J., Bunnell, J.E., Precipitation and the occurrence of Lyme disease in the northeastern United States (2004) Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis, 4 (2), pp. 143-148; Subak, S., Effects of climate on variability in Lyme disease incidence in the northeastern United States (2003) Am J Epidemiol, 157 (6), pp. 531-538; Ogden, N.H., Maarouf, A., Barker, I.K., Climate change and the potential for range expansion of the Lyme disease vector Ixodes scapularis in Canada (2006) Int J Parasitol, 36 (1), pp. 63-70; Brownstein, J.S., Holford, T.R., Fish, D., A climate-based model predicts the spatial distribution of the Lyme disease vector Ixodes scapularis in the United States (2003) Environ Health Perspect, 111 (9), pp. 1152-1157; Jobe, D.A., Lovrich, S.D., Nelson, J.A., Borrelia burgdorferi in Ixodes scapularis ticks, Chicago area (2006) Emerg Infect Dis, 12 (6), pp. 1039-1041; Dryden, M.W., Payne, P.A., Biology and control of ticks infesting dogs and cats in North America (2004) Vet Ther, 5 (4), pp. 236-237; Macintire, D.K., Diagnosis and Treatment of Common Tick-Borne Diseases, , www.vin.com, Accessed March 2008 at","Madsen, L.
