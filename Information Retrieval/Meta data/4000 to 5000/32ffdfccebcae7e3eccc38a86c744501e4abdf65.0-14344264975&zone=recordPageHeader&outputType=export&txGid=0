Recent biogeographical analyses indicate that D. robusta invaded North America from southeast Asia and has persisted in eastern temperate forests for at least 20-25 my without speciating. The abundant chromosome polymorphisms found across the range of D. robusta are thus likely to be relatively ancient, having accumulated over many well known climatic cycles in North America. Sufficient long-term data are now available such that we can now gauge the rate of these evolutionary changes in natural populations due to environmental change. Results: Recent local collections have revealed significant changes in the frequencies of several chromosomal forms. New data presented here extend the range of these changes to six states, three in the northeastern United States and three west of the Mississippi River. These data reinforce recent directional changes in which the frequencies of three gene arrangements have reached percentage levels typical of distant southern populations consistent with regional climatic changes. Another gene arrangement has been steadily decreasing in frequency at a number of the sites studied. Meteorological records from 1945 to 2003 indicate temperature increases at all study sites, particularly average minimum air temperatures. Conclusions: Observation of parallel genetic flux suggests that these long-term temporal frequency shifts in widely disparate populations of D. robusta are evolutionary responses to environmental change. Since these chromosomes are known to be sensitive to ambient temperature, regional climatic shifts associated with global warming are likely to be responsible. © 2005 Levitan and Etges; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Drosophila robusta; analysis of variance; animal; chromosome; chromosome map; climate; Drosophila; female; gene; genetic polymorphism; genetics; geography; greenhouse effect; karyotyping; male; molecular evolution; physiology; population genetics; sex difference; species difference; temperature; time; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes; Climate; Drosophila; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Genes, Insect; Genetics, Population; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Karyotyping; Male; Polymorphism, Genetic; Sex Factors; Species Specificity; Temperature; Time Factors",,,,,,"Parmesan, C., Yohe, G., A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 37-42; Parmesan, C., Galbraith, H., (2004) Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the U.S., p. 67. , Pew Center on Global Climate Change, Arlington, Virginia; Root, T.L., Price, J.T., Hall, K.R., Schneider, S.H., Rosenzweig, C., Pounds, J.A., Fingerprints of global warming on wild animals and plants (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 57-60; Williams, S.E., Botho, E.E., Fox, S., Climate change in Australian tropical rainforests: An impending environmental catastrophe (2003) Proc Roy Soc London, B (Biol Sci), 270, pp. 1887-1892; Cotton, P.A., Avian migration phenology and global climate change (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 12219-12222; Rice, K.J., Emery, N.C., Managing microevolution: Restoration in the face of global change (2003) Front Ecol Environ, 1, pp. 469-478; Wheeler, M.R., Additions to the catalog of the world's Drosophilidae (1986) The Genetics and Biology of Drosophila, 3 E, pp. 395-409. , Edited by: Ashburner M, Carson HL, Thompson JN Jr. London: Academic Press; Dobzhansky, T., Anderson, W.W., Pavlovsky, O., Genetics of natural populations.
