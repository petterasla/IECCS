Fuel-consuming processes included tractor-based field operations, transportation of products and materials and grain drying. In conventional tillage (CT) systems, total CO 2 emissions from fuel consumption were 826.2, 605.4, 424.2 and 738.7 kg CO2 ha-1 for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), adzuki bean (Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi and Ohashi) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production, respectively. In winter wheat production, 55% of total CO2 emission were released from kerosene and electricity use for grain drying, the remainder from tractor-based field operations. In contrast, for sugar beet, adzuki bean and potato production, field operations were the main contributors to CO2 emissions. Of the field operations, tillage and harvesting required the largest amounts of fuels. Under reduced tillage (RT) systems in which soil preparation in early spring was reduced and plowing after harvesting was omitted, 47.51 ha-1 of diesel oil equivalent to 125.4 kg CO2 ha -1 could be saved, regardless of crop species. Consequently, total CO2 emissions could be reduced by 15-29%, respectively, in winter wheat and adzuki bean production. In the Tokachi region of Hokkaido, a primary arable crop production region in Japan, annual CO2 emissions under CT and RT for the four crops produced were estimated at 82.7 Gg CO2 per year and 67.4 Gg CO2 per year, respectively. Besides reduced fuel costs, the use of RT production systems could significantly reduce the large quantities of CO2 released as a result of arable land crop production in northern Japan. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
