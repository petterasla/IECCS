The writers circumvent this difficulty by using a physical model for severe hurricanes to derive changes in hurricane rainfall under a predicted global warming. The modified rainfall is then transferred to a linked hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to compute the impact of global warming on hurricane-induced flooding in a susceptible watershed. As an example, using simulations of tropical, doubled-CO<inf>2</inf> climate change, the hurricane model predicts a 40% precipitation increase for severe hurricanes affecting southeastern Florida. The 40% increase is assumed for a 100-year, three-day event used for flood-management planning in South Florida and applied to the Basin Runoff and Streamflow Simulation (BRASS) model of the Western C-11 drainage system. The increased precipitation provokes substantially greater flooding that could negate most of the benefits of present water-management practices in this basin. © ASCE.",,"Climatology; Hurricane effects; Hydrodynamics; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Climate variability; Flooding; Global warming; Floods; Flooding Hurricanes; Global Warming; climate change; flood; global warming; hurricane; modelling approach; natural hazard; precipitation; USA, Florida",,,,,,"Climate Change.
