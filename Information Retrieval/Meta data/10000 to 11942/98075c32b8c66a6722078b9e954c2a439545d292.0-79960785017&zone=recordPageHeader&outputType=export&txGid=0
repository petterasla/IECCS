CO 2-neutral energy generation using biomass or organic waste is an alternative option that deserves attention particularly in developing countries. The aim of this paper is to provide an integrated framework for the preparation of feasibility studies for the renewable energy sector there, considering technical, environmental, economic, socio-cultural, legal and institutional aspects which are particular applicable for developing countries. Such a feasibility framework involves a definition of the scope, which reflects the aims and objectives of the target groups (supplier, operator, etc. of renewable energy supply) and the methodologies and tools involved. All relevant aspects are covered: data collection, selection of sites and assessment of options. Furthermore, methods and tools for risk assessment and decision-making are presented and a practical plan of procedures is last provided. The proposed framework is then applied to a selected area in Vietnam and certain results of the study, showing that the implementation of a biogas plant utilising organic waste would be feasible, are presented in this paper.","Energy recovery; Insular communities; Organic waste","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; decision making; developing world; energy planning; power generation; renewable resource; risk assessment; sustainable development; Phu Quoc Island; Viet Nam",,,,,,"Klass, D., Biomass for RE and fuels (2004) Encyclopedia of Energy, 1, p. 193; Mitchell, C., Bridgewater, A., Stevens, D., Toft, A., Watters, M., Technoeconomic assessment of biomass to energy (1995) Biomass and Bioenergy, 9, p. 205; McCormick, K., Kåberger, T., Key barriers for bioenergy in Europe: Economic conditions, know-how and institutional capacity, and supply chain co-ordination (2007) Biomass and Bioenergy, 31 (7), p. 443; Quyhn, D., Phu Quoc's framework conditions for the implementation of RE (electricity and heat) from compost and biogas (2005) RENEW Workshop, 5 (12). , Phu Quoc, Vietnam; Dalheimer, F., Heerenklage, J., Stegmann, R., A multichamber anaerobic dry fermentation plant for the pretreatment of MSW (1999) Proc. of Sardinia'99 International Symposium, 1, pp. 443-446. , Cagliari, Italy; Kottner, M., Dry fermentation - A new method for biological treatment (2005) International Biogas and Bioenergy Centre of Competence (IBBC), p. 16. , Jagst, Germany; Global emission model of integrated systems manual (2008) Öko-Institut (Institute for Applied Ecology), , GEMIS:, Darmstadt, August","Perkoulidis, G.; Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Environmental Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GR-54 124 Thessaloniki, Greece; email: gperk@aix.meng.auth.gr",,,,,,,,13115065,,,,"English","J.
