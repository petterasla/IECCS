The results showed that the total CH4 emissions from PF were 646.3±52.1 and 215.0±45.4 kg CH4 hm-2 during the rice-growing period and non-rice period, respectively. Both values were much lower than many previous reports from similar regions in Southwest China. The CH4 emissions in the rice-growing season were more intensive in PF, as compared to RW and RR. Only 33% of the total annual CH4 emission in PF occurred in the non-rice season, though the duration of this season is two times longer than the rice season. The annual mean N2O flux in PF was 4.5±0.6 kg N2O hm-2 yr-1. The N2O emission in the rice-growing season was also more intensive than in the non-rice season, with only 16% of the total annual emission occurring in the non-rice season. The amounts of N2O emission in PF were ignorable compared to the CH4 emission in terms of the global warming potential (GWP). Changing PF to RW or RR not only eliminated CH4 emissions in the non-rice season, but also substantially reduced the CH4 emission during the following rice-growing period (ca. 58%, P&lt;0.05). However, this change in cultivation system substantially increased N2O emissions, especially in the non-rice season, by a factor of 3.7 to 4.5. On the 100-year horizon, the integrated GWP of total annual CH4 and N2O emissions satisfies PF≫RR≈RW. The GWP of PF is higher than that of RW and RR by a factor of 2.6 and 2.7, respectively. Of the total GWP of CH4 and N2O emissions, CH4 emission contributed to 93%, 65% and 59% in PF, RW and RR, respectively. These results suggest that changing PF to RW and RR can substantially reduce not only CH4 emission but also the total GWP of the CH4 and N2O emissions.","CH4; Cultivation systems; Global warming potential (GWP); N2O; Permanently flooded rice fields",,,,,,,"Abao Jr., E.B., Bronson, K.F., Wassmann, R., Singh, U., Simultaneous records of methane and nitrous oxide emissions in rice-based cropping systems under rainfed conditions (2000) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 58, pp. 131-139; Aulakh, M.S., Khera, T.S., Doran, J.W., Bronson, K.F., Denitrification, N2O and CO2 fluxes in rice-wheat cropping system as affected by crop residues, fertilizer N and legume green manure (2001) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 34, pp. 375-389; Cai, Z.C., Xing, G.X., Yan, X.Y., Xu, H., Tsuruta, H., Yagi, K., Minami, K., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy fields as affected by nitrogen fertilizers and water management (1997) Plant and Soil, 196, pp. 7-14; Cai, Z.C., Tsuruta, H., Gao, M., Xu, H., Wei, C.F., Options for mitigating methane emission from a permanently flooded rice field (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 37-45; Zuong, C., Progress of research on methane emission from flooded rice fields in China (1999) Soils, 3, pp. 266-269. , (in Chinese); Dezhang, C., Wang, M., Shuangguan, X., Huang, J., Rasmussen, R.A., Khalil, M.K.A., Methane emission from paddy fields in the Southwest China (1993) Advances in Earth Science, 8 (5), pp. 47-54. , (in Chinese); Chen, G.X., Huang, G.H., Huang, B., Yu, K.W., Wu, J., Xu, H., Nitrous oxide and methane emissions from soil-plant systems (1997) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 49, pp. 41-45; Davidson, E.A., Matson, P.A., Brooks, P.D., Nitrous oxide emission controls and inorganic nitrogen dynamics in fertilized tropical agricultural soils (1996) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 60, pp. 1145-1152; Denier van der Gon, H.A.C., Neue, H.U., Influence of organic matter incorporation on the methane emission from a wetland rice field (1995) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 9 (1), pp. 11-22; Dobbie, K.E., Smith, K.A., Impact of different forms of N fertilizer on N2O emissions from intensive grassland (2003) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 67, pp. 37-46; Ghosh, S., Majumdar, D., Jain, M.C., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from an irrigated rice of North India (2003) Chemosphere, 51, pp. 181-192; Ramaswamy, V., Climate Change 2001: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, pp. 388-389. , Coauthors: Radiative forcing of climate.
