Over-abstraction is considered one of the main causes of seawater intrusion and the rise in sea levels accelerates the intrusion. With the combined impact of sea level rise and over-pumping the problem becomes exacerbated and requires urgent solutions. Previous studies have mainly focused on the study of impact of sea level rise or over-abstraction on seawater intrusion separately and their combined effects have not been studied in the literature. This paper presents application of a coupled transient density-dependent finite element model to simulate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers and investigates the individual and combined effects of likely sea level rise and over-pumping on seawater intrusion. Three scenarios are considered: rise in sea levels due to climate change, decline in groundwater table due to overpumping and combination of sea level rise and over-pumping. The results show that, in the case study considered in this paper, the rise in the sea level moved the transition zone inland by about 5%. However, the combination of sea level rise and over-pumping resulted in further inland movement of the transition zone (about 8%). The amount of intrusion greatly depends on the depth, size and properties of the aquifer. While the intrusion is a few metres in a small aquifer, it could be several kilometres in a large aquifer. © IWA Publishing 2011.","Climate change; Global warming; Over-pumping; Sea level rise; Seawater intrusion","Density-dependent; Finite element models; Future challenges; Ground water table; Over-abstraction; Over-pumping; Sea level rise; Water resources management; Abstracting; Aquifers; Climate change; Finite element method; Global warming; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Pumps; Salt water intrusion; Sea level; climate change; coastal aquifer; global warming; groundwater; saline intrusion; sea level change; seawater; transition zone; water resource; water table",,,,,,"Canning, D.J., (2001) Climate Variability, Climate Change, and Sealevel Rise in Puget Sound: Possibilities for the Future, , University of Washington, Report Washington Department of Ecology and JISAO/SMA Climate Impact Group; Cheng, J., Strobl, R.O., Yeh, G., Lin, H., Choi, W.H., Modeling of 2D density-dependant flow and transport in the subsurface (1998) Hydro.
