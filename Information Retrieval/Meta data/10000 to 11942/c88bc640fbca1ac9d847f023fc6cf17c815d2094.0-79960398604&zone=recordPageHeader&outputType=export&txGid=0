The area changes in these lakes have been proved to be the results of regional climate changes and recent human activities. This study aimed at investigating the area variations of the nine major lakes in Central Asia over the last 30 years. Firstly, multi-temporal Landsat imagery in 1975, 1990, 1999, and 2007 were used to delineate lake extents automatically based on Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) threshold segmentation, then lake area variations were detailed in three decades and the mechanism of these changes was analyzed with meteorological data and hydrological data. The results indicated that the total surface areas of these nine lakes had decreased from 91,402.06 km 2 to 46,049.23 km2 during 1975-2007, accounting for 49.62% of their original area of 1975. Tail-end lakes in flat areas had shrunk dramatically as they were induced by both climate changes and human impacts, while alpine lakes remained relatively stable due to the small precipitation variations. With different water usage of river outlets, the variations of open lakes were more flexible than those of other two types. According to comprehensive analyses, different types of inland lakes presented different trends of area changes under the background of global warming effects in Central Asia, which showed that the increased human activities had broken the balance of water cycles in this region. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Arid region; Central Asia; Climate change; Human activities; Inland lake; Lake variations","Alpine lakes; Area-changes; Central Asia; Comprehensive analysis; Flat area; Human activities; Human impact; Hydrological data; Inland lake; Lake areas; Landsat imagery; Meteorological data; Multi-temporal; Normalized difference water index; Precipitation variation; Regional climate changes; Threshold segmentation; Total surface area; Water cycle; Water usage; Arid regions; Global warming; Meteorology; Surface water resources; Lakes; arid region; climate change; climate effect; global warming; human activity; hydrological cycle; lake dynamics; Landsat thematic mapper; water budget; article; Asia; climate change; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental change; evaporation; geographic distribution; glacier; greenhouse effect; human activities; human impact (environment); hydrology; image analysis; inland lake; irrigation (agriculture); lake; lake area variation; meteorology; precipitation; seasonal variation; telecommunication; topography; water analysis; water cycle; water supply; Asia; Climate; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Water Cycle; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply; Central Asia",,"Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"Aladin, N.V., Plotnikov, I.S., Large saline lakes of former USSR: A summary review (1993) Hydrobiologia, 267 (1-3), pp. 1-12; Alejandra, L.C., Felipe-Omar, T.S., Boris, E.R., Lake Chapala change detection using time series, remote sensing for agriculture, ecosystems, and hydrology (2008) Guido d'Urso, Proc. of SPIE, p. 7104. , X.
