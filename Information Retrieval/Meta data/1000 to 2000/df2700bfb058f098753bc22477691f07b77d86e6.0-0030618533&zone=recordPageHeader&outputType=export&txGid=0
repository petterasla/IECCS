It is now widely accepted that realistic assessment of plant responses to enhanced UV-B should be performed at sufficiently high Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), preferably under field conditions. This will often imply, that responses of plants to enhanced UV-B in the field will be assessed under simultaneous water shortage, nutrient deficiency and variation of temperature. Since atmospheric CO2 enrichment, global warming and increasing UV-B radiation represent components of global climatic change, interactions of UV-B with CO2 enrichment and temperature are particularly relevant. Only few relevant UV-Bx CO2 interaction studies have been published. Most of these studies refer to greenhouse experiments. We report a significant CO2 x UV-B interaction for the total plant dry weight and root dry weight of the C3-grass Elymus athericus. At elevated CO2 (720 μmol mol-1), plant growth was much less reduced by enhanced UV-B than at ambient CO2 although there were significant (positive) CO2 effects and (negative) UV-B effects on plant growth. Most other CO2x UV-B studies do not report significant interactions on total plant biomass. This lack of CO2 x UV-B interactions may result from the fact that primary metabolic targets for CO2 and UVB are different. UV-B and CO2 may differentially affect plant morphogenetic parameters: biomass allocation, branching, flowering, leaf thickness, emergence and senescence. Such more subtle interactions between CO2 and UV-B need careful and long term experimentation to be detected. In the case of no significant CO2x UV-B interactions, combined CO2 and UV-B effects will be additive. Plants differ in their response to CO2 and UV-B, they respond in general positively to elevated CO2 and negatively to enhanced UV-B. Moreover, plant species differ in their responsiveness to CO2 and UV-B. Therefore, even in case of additive CO2 and UV-B effects, plant competitive relationships may change markedly under current climatic change with simultaneous enhanced atmospheric CO2 and solar UV-B radiation.","CO2 enrichment; Elymus athericus; Interaction; UV-B radiation","carbon dioxide enrichment; climatic change; terrestrial ecosystem; ultraviolet-B; Elymus athericus; Poaceae",,,,,,"Adamse, P., Britz, S.J., Amelioration of UV-B damage under high irradiance I: Role of photosynthesis (1992) Photochem.
