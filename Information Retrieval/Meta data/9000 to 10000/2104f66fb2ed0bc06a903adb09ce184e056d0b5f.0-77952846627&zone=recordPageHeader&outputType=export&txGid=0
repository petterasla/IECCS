Federal policymakers are currently considering and several states have enacted a combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard which proponents argue provides a comprehensive approach with greater flexibility and at lower cost. We examine the financial impacts on various stakeholders from alternative compliance strategies with a Combined Efficiency and Renewable Electricity Standard (CERES) using a case study approach for utilities in Kansas. Our results suggest that an investor-owned utility is likely to pursue the most lucrative compliance strategy for its shareholders-one that under-invests in energy efficiency resources. If a business model for energy efficiency inclusive of both a lost fixed cost recovery mechanism and a shareholder incentive mechanism is implemented, our analysis indicates that an investor-owned utility would be more willing to pursue energy efficiency as a lower-cost CERES compliance strategy. Absent implementing such a regulatory mechanism, separate energy efficiency and renewable portfolio standards would improve the likelihood of reducing reliance on fossil fuels at least-cost through the increased pursuit of energy efficiency. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Public policy; Renewable energy","Alternative compliance strategy; Business models; Case study approach; Compliance strategies; Detrimental effects; Energy independence; Federal policies; Financial impacts; Fixed cost; Global climate changes; Incentive mechanism; Lower cost; Policy makers; Regulatory mechanism; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy; Renewable portfolio standard; Renewable technology; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Depreciation; Fossil fuels; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Renewable energy resources; Shareholders; Standards; Energy efficiency; compliance; economic impact; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; renewable resource; stakeholder; standard (regulation); utility sector; Kansas; United States",,,,,,"Barbose, G., Goldman, C., Schlegel, J., The shifting landscape of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency in the U.S. (2009) The Electricity Journal, 22 (8), pp. 29-44; Brown, M., York, D., Nadel, S., Reduced emissions and lower costs: combining renewable energy and energy efficiency into a sustainable energy portfolio standard (2007) The Electricity Journal, 20 (4), pp. 62-72; Cappers, P., Goldman, C., Chait, M., Edgar, G., Schlegel, J., Shirley, W., (2009) Financial Analysis of Incentive Mechanisms to Promote Energy Efficiency: Case Study of a Prototypical Southwest Utility, , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Report No: 1598E; Chen, C., Wiser, R., Bolinger, M., (2007) Weighing the Costs and Benefits of State Renewables Portfolio Standards: A Comparative Analysis of State-Level Policy Impact Projections, , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Report No: 61580; Cita, J.B., Glass, Sanderson, (2008), http://kec.kansas.gov/reports/2008_wind_report.pdf, A Benefit Cost Study of the 2015 Wind Challenge: An Assessment of Wind Energy Economics in Kansas for 2006-2034.
