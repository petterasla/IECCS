However, widely-distributed Miocene sediments of the Tianshui Basin in the NE Tibetan Plateau provide a great potential for deciphering the Miocene vegetation and climate history of this region. This paper presents first sporopollen record from these sediments, covering the period from 17.1 to 6.1. Ma. Sporopollen data reveal that temperate, warm-temperate broad-leaved forest of Quercus, Ulmus and Betula dominated the Tianshui region between 17.1 and 14.7. Ma, which was replaced by forest or forest-steppe of Ulmus, Artemisia and Betula between 14.7 and 11.7. Ma. After a return to a broad-leaved forest of Betula and Quercus during 11.7-8.5. Ma, the forest decreased rapidly and was replaced mostly by steppe vegetation (mainly composed of Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae) after 8.5. Ma. We interpret the observed vegetation changes as a result of global climate change, which is characterized by global cooling, development of Arctic ice-sheets and permanent El Niño state after the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum. The rapid development of steppe at about 8.5. Ma suggested a permanent drying of the Asian interior at this time, coinciding with the onset of the well-known Hipparion red clay deposition in North China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Miocene; Paleovegetation; Sporopollen; Tianshui Basin","broad-leaved forest; climate variation; deposition; El Nino; ice sheet; Miocene; paleobotany; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleotemperature; reconstruction; spatial distribution; steppe; vegetation history; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Acer pensylvanicum; Amaranthaceae; Artemisia; Betula; Hipparion; Poaceae; Quercus; Ulmus",,,,,,"Alonso-Zarza, A.M., Zhao, Z., Song, C.H., Li, J.J., Zhang, J., Martín-Pérez, A., Martín-García, R., Zhang, M.H., Mudflat/distal fan and shallow lake sedimentation (upper Vallesian-Turolian) in the Tianshui Basin, Central China: evidence against the late Miocene eolian loess (2009) Sedimentary Geology, 222, pp. 42-51; An, Z.S., Kutzbach, J.E., Prell, W.L., Porter, S.C., Evolution of Asian monsoons and phased uplift of the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau since Late Miocene times (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 62-66; Cande, S.C., Kent, D.V., Revised calibration of the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale for the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic (1995) Journal of Geophysical Research, 100, pp. 6093-6095; Cerling, T.E., Harris, J.M., MacFadden, B.J., Leakey, M.G., Quade, J., Eisenmann, V., Ehleringer, J.R., Global vegetation change through the Miocene/Pliocene boundary (1997) Nature, 389, pp. 153-158; Chiang, J.C.H., Bitz, C.M., Influence of high latitude ice cover on the marine Intertropical Convergence Zone (2005) Climate Dynamics; Deng, T., Evolution of the Late Cenozoic mammalian faunas in the Linxia basin and its background relevant to the uplift of the Qinghai-Xizang plateau (2004) Quaternary Science, 24, pp. 413-420. , (in Chinese with English abstract); Deng, T., Chinese Neogene mammal biochronology (2006) Vertebrate PalAsiatic, 44, pp. 143-163; Ding, Z.L., Xiong, S.F., Sun, J.M., Yang, S.L., Gu, Z.Y., Liu, T.S., Pedostratigraphy and paleomagnetism of a -7.0Ma eolian loess-red clay sequence at Lingtai, Loess Plateau, north-central China and the implications for paleomonsoon evolution (1999) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 152, pp. 49-66; Fang, X.M., Garzione, C., Voo, R., Li, J.J., Fan, M.J., Flexural subsidence by 29 Ma on the NE edge of Tibet from the magnetostratigraphy of Linxia Basin, China (2003) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 210, pp. 545-560; Fang, X.M., Yan, M., Voo, R.V.D., Rea, D.K., Song, C.H., Parés, J.M., Gao, J.P., Dai, S., Late Cenozoic deformation and uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau: evidence from high-resolution magnetostratigraphy of the Guide Basin, Qinghai Province, China (2005) Geological Society of America Bulletin, 117, pp. 1208-1225; Flower, B.P., Kennett, J.P., The Middle Miocene climatic transition: East Antarctic ice sheet development, deep ocean circulation and global carbon cycling (1994) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 108, pp. 537-555; Flower, B.P., Kennett, J.P., Middle Miocene deepwater paleoceanography in the southwest Pacific: relating with East Antarctic ice sheet development (1995) paleoceanography, 10, pp. 1095-1112; Guo, Z.T., Ruddiman, W.F., Hao, Q.Z., Wu, H.B., Qiao, Y.S., Zhu, R.X., Peng, S.Z., Liu, T.S., Onset of Asian desertication by 22Myr ago inferred from loess deposits in China (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 159-163; Guo, Z.T., Peng, S.Z., Hao, Q.Z., Biscaye, P.E., An, Z.S., Liu, T.S., Late Miocene-Pliocene development of Asian aridification as recorded in the Red-Earth Formation in northern China (2004) Global and Planetary Change, 41, pp. 135-145; Hou, X.Y., (1982) Vegetation Geography of China with Reference to the Chemical Composition of Dominant Plants, , Science Press, Beijing, (in Chinese); Huang, D.S., (1997) Vegetation of Gansu Province.
