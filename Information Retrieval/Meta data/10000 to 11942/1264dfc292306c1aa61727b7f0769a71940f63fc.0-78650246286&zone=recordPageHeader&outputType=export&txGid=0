In Porijõgi, closed-chamber based sampling lasted from October 2001 to October 2009, whereas in Viiratsi the sampling period was from November 2003 to October 2009. Both temporal and spatial variations in all GHG gas fluxes were remarkable. Local differences in GHG fluxes between micro-sites ("" Edge"" , "" Dry"" and "" Wet"" in Porijõgi, and "" Wet"" , "" Slope"" and "" Dry"" in Viiratsi) were sometimes greater than those between sites. Median values of GHG fluxes from both sites over the whole study period and all microsites did not differ significantly, being 45 and 42mg CO2-Cm-2h-1, 8 and 0.5μg CH4-Cm-2h-1, 1.0 and 2.1mgN2-Nm-2h-1, and 5 and 9μgN2O-Nm-2h-1, in Porijõgi and Viiratsi, respectively. The N2:N2O ratio in Viiratsi (40-1200) was lower than in Porijõgi (10-7600). The median values-based estimation of the Global Warming Potential of CH4 and N2O was 19 and 185kg CO2 equivalents (eq)ha-1yr-1 in Porijõgi and -14 and 336kg CO2 eqha-1yr-1 in Viiratsi, respectively. A significant Spearman rank correlation was found between the mean monthly air temperature and CO2, CH4 and N2 fluxes in Porijõgi, and N2O flux in Viiratsi, and between the monthly precipitation and CH4 fluxes in both study sites. Higher groundwater level significantly increases CH4 emission and decreases CO2 and N2O emission, whereas higher soil temperature significantly increases N2O, CH4 and N2 emission values. In Porijõgi, GHG emissions did not display any discernable trend, whereas in Viiratsi a significant increase in CO2, N2, and N2O emissions has been found. This may be a result of the age of the grey alder stand, but may also be caused by the long-term nutrient load of this riparian alder stand, which indicates a need for the management of similar heavily loaded riparian alder stands. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Denitrification; Dinitrogen; Global warming potential; Methane; Nitrous oxide","Agricultural activities; Agricultural landscapes; Air temperature; Carbon fluxes; Closed chambers; Dinitrogen; Emission values; Estonia; Gas flux; Gaseous nitrogen; GHG emission; GHG flux; Global warming potential; Ground water level; Lateral Flow; Median value; Microsites; Nitrous oxide; Nutrient loads; Pig slurries; Sampling period; Soil temperature; Spearman rank correlation; Study sites; Temporal and spatial variation; Anesthetics; Carbon dioxide; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Global warming; abandoned land; agricultural emission; agricultural practice; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; deciduous forest; denitrification; forest management; global warming; greenhouse gas; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; pig; riparian forest; sampling; slurry; soil temperature; water level; Estonia; Alnus; Alnus incana; Suidae",,,,,,"Altor, A.E., Mitsch, W.J., Methane flux from created riparian marshes: Relationship to intermittent versus continuous inundation and emergent macrophytes (2006) Ecol.
