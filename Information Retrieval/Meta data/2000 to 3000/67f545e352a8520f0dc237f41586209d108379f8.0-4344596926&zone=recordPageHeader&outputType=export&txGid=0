Road, Calcutta 700104, India","During the last decade, there has been worldwide concern with global climate change, which has been induced by greenhouse gases (GHGs) due to the use of fossil fuels. The CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion have been identified as the single most significant source of GHG emissions into the atmosphere. Realizing the need to control and regulate emissions of pollutants, the objective of the present study estimates the trend of CO2 SO 2 and NOx between the periods 1991-92 and 1996-97. An input-output structural decomposition analysis approach is used to determine their sources of change. It also provides a set of alternative scenarios for the year 2001-2 and 2006-7. The sources of changes in the amount of CO2 SO2 and NOx emissions are categorized into four factors: the ecoefficiency, the structure of production, the structure of demand, and the volume of demand. Results indicate that the electricity sector contributes more towards direct, as well as indirect, emission coefficients. The petroleum product sector also contributes more in this respect. The dominant role is played by the structure of demand and the volume of demand.","Emission; Fossil fuels; Structural decomposition analysis","Climate change; Combustion; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Fossil fuel combustion; Structural decomposition analysis; Air pollution; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; combustion; emission control; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; air pollution; article; atmosphere; climate change; combustion; decomposition; ecosystem; electricity; greenhouse gas; India; petrochemical industry; structural decomposition analysis; technique",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5",,,,"Bose, R.K., Automotive energy use and emissions control: A simulation model to analyse transport strategies for Indian metropolises (1998) Energy Policy, 26 (13), pp. 1001-1016; Bossier, E., Rous, R.D., Economic effects of carbon tax: Application in Belgium with the multisectoral model Hermes (1992) Energy Economics, 14, pp. 33-41; Breuil, J.M., Input-output analysis and pollutant emissions in France (1992) Energy Journal, 13 (3), pp. 173-184; Chang, Y.F., Lin, S.J., Structural decomposition of industrial CO2 emission in Taiwan: An input-output approach (1998) Energy Policy, 26 (1), pp. 5-12; (1995) Energy Sectors for India, , Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, Mumbai, India; (1998) Energy Sectors for India, , Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, Mumbai, India; Common, M.S., Salma, U., Accounting for changes in Australian carbon dioxide emissions (1992) Energy Economics, 14 (3), pp. 217-225; Gay, S., Proops, J.L.R., Carbon dioxide production by UK economy: An input-output assessment (1993) Applied Energy, 44 (2), pp. 113-130; Goldemberg, J., Monaco, L.C., Macedo, I.C., The Brazilian fuel Alcohol program (1993) Renewable Energy: Sources for Fuels and Electricity, , Johansson, T.B., Kelly, H., Reddy, A.K.N. and Williams, R.
