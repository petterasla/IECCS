It is shown that the growth in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption in North America, excluding Mexico, from 1990 to 1996 was 3.7 times higher than that of Latin America in absolute terms. The cumulative contribution to global warming, expressed as the mass of the gas multiplied by time (GtCy), can be calculated as the integration of the atmospheric concentration of the emitted gas along time, with a weight function in the integrand to simulate the climate response. To simulate climate response, we used the superposition of exponential decay functions with different decay constants. The historical contributions of the OECD countries, the Eastern European countries and the ex-Soviet Union, and from all developing countries are considered. The future contributions are computed in three scenarios. All of them show that emissions from Non-Annex I countries will become higher than those of Annex 1 countries soon after 2010, while the curves of atmospheric concentration will cross one another later, not much before 2050, and the respective contributions to global temperature increase will cross about 2090.",,"carbon dioxide; climate variation; emission control; fossil fuel; global warming; North America",,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Narain, S., (1991) Global Warming in an Unequal World, , Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi; Banuri, T., (1995), p. 47. , IPCC, Working Group III Report, 1996 FCCC/CP, Framework of the Climate Change Convention, Addendum 2 of the ReportCubasch, U., Hasselmann, K., Hock, H., Maier-Reimer, E., Mikoiajewicz, U., Santer, B.D., Sausen, R., Time-dependent greenhouse warming computations with a coupled ocean atmosphere model Climate Dynamics, 8, pp. 55-69; Den Elzen, M., Berk, M., Schaeffer, M., Oliver, J., Hendriks, C., Metz, B., (1999) The Brazilian Proposal and Other Options for International Burden Sharing: An Evaluation of Methodological and Policy Aspects Using the FAIR Model, National Institute of Public Health and Environment, , The Netherlands, presented and discussed in the Expert Meeting, INPE, C.
