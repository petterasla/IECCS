For a 'business-as-usual' scenario, results indicate that for the period 2051-2080 compared to the period 1951-1980 there will be a decrease of rainfall in central Australia of about 10 to 20 per cent. In addition, the probability of extreme rainfall deficits is increased. This increase is largest in autumn. In summer, changes in atmospheric circulation, resulting in a more southerly flow advecting dry air into central Australia appear to be the dominant mechanism for the reduction in rainfall and increase in severe rainfall deficits. The increase in occurrences of southerly flow is caused by the development of a heat low over Australia in response to global warming. In autumn, the reduction in rainfall is due to soil drying. During this season the probability of severe rainfall deficits is significantly enhanced due to the reduction of soil moisture caused by the decrease in rainfall and enhanced evaporation in the preceding summer.",,"atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; climate prediction; evaporation; global warming; precipitation (climatology); probability; rainfall; severe weather; soil moisture; Australasia; Australia",,,,,,"(2001) Climate Change.
