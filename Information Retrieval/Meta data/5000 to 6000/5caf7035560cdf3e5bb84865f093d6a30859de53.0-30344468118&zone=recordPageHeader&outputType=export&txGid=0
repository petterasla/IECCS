Based on paleoanalogous scenarios, Central Asian deserts are often predicted to become wetter as a result of global warming because they are located north of 30° latitude. However, despite some similarities between the paleoclimate changes and greenhouse warming, such predictions have very serious limitations. Climate models predict that the temperature in arid Central Asia will increase by 1-2°C by 2030-2050, with the greatest increases in wintertime. Some models project greater aridity in the future though others project less aridity, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that climate change modeling in arid zones is extremely uncertain because of the extreme natural variability (both temporal and spatial) of the desert climate. The physical differences of climate change forcings imply that one might expect quite different regional responses to future human-induced climate change compared to the Holocene climate in terms of their rapidity and amplitude. Local and regional human impacts, such as massive irrigation, may have a stronger impact on the climatic system at the regional level than global climate change.
