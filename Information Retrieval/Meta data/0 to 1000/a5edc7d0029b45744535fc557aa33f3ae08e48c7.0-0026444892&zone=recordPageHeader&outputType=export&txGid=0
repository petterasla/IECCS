Because global warming is expected to reduce the areal extent of snow cover, the results of this study reveal snow cover should act to increase the diurnal temperature range in the years to come. -from Authors",,"diurnal temperature; snowcover; temperature range",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026444892
