This paper describes the current status and specific features of the Lithuanian power system, and in particular discusses the role of the distributed generators. Country's energy policy during last two decades was focused on substantial modernisation of the energy systems, their reorganisation and creation of appropriate institutional structure and necessary legal basis. The most important factors stimulating development of distributed generation in Lithuania are the following: international obligations to increase contribution of power plants using renewable energy sources into electricity production balance; development of small (with capacity less than 50. MW) cogeneration power plants; implementation of energy policy directed to promotion of renewable energy sources and cogeneration. Analysis of the legal and economic environment, as well as principles of regulation of distributed generation and barriers to its development is presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed energy resources; Distributed generation; Lithuanian energy policy","Cogeneration power plants; Current status; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed generators; Economic environment; Electricity production; Energy sector; Energy systems; Global climate changes; Global recession; Institutional structure; International obligations; Lithuania; Lithuanian energy policy; Renewable energy source; Reorganisation; Climate change; Cogeneration plants; Distributed power generation; Energy policy; Energy resources; Nuclear power plants; Plant shutdowns; Nuclear energy; climate change; electricity supply; energy policy; modernization; power generation; renewable resource; Lithuania",,,,,,"(2007) Analyses of energy supply options and security of energy supply in the Baltic States, , IAEA, Vienna, IAEA; Bayod-Rujula, A.A., Future development of the electricity systems with distributed generation (2009) Energy, 34, pp. 377-383; Carley, S., Distributed generation: an empirical analysis of primary motivators (2009) Energy Policy, 37, pp. 1648-1659; Cossent, R., Gomeza, T., Friasa, P., Towards a future with large penetration of distributed generation: is the current regulation of electricity distribution ready?
