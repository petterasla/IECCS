Environmental impacts are determined by characterizing and weighting (using CO 2 equivalents, Eco-indicator 99, and Eco-scarcity) the flowsheet and inventory modeling results. The methodology is applied to a waste biomass to synthetic natural gas (SNG) conversion process involving a catalytic hydrothermal gasification step. Several scenarios are constructed for different Swiss biomass feedstocks and different scales depending on logistical choices: large-scale (155 MW SNG) and small-scale (5.2 MW SNG) scenarios for a manure feedstock and one scenario (35.6 MW SNG) for a wood feedstock. Process modeling shows that 62% of the manure's lower heating value (LHV) is converted to SNG and 71% of wood's LHV is converted to SNG. Life cycle modeling shows that, for all processes, about 10% of fossil energy use is imbedded in the produced renewable SNG. Converting manure and replacing it, as a fertilizer, with the process mineral byproduct leads to reduced N2O emissions and an improved environmental performance such as global warming potential: -0.6 kg CO2eq./MJ SNG vs -0.02 kg CO2eq./MJ SNG for wood scenarios. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Biomass feedstocks; Conversion process; Different scale; Eco-indicator 99; Environmental performance; Flowsheet; Fossil energies; Global warming potentials; Heat and power; Hydrothermal gasifications; Inventory modeling; Life-cycle assessments; Lower heating values; Mass and energy balances; Process evaluations; Process Modeling; Synthetic natural gas; Waste biomass; Biological materials; Biomass; Environmental impact; Feedstocks; Flowcharting; Gas generators; Gas industry; Gasification; Global warming; Manures; Process engineering; Life cycle; natural gas; biomass; catalysis; hydrothermal activity; life cycle analysis; modeling; waste treatment; article; biomass; energy balance; fossil energy; gasification; life cycle assessment; process model; Biomass; Gases; Methane; Models, Chemical; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Waste Products; Water; Wood",,"natural gas, 8006-14-2; Gases; Methane, 74-82-8; Waste Products; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Johnson, J.C., (2006) Technology Assessment of Biomass Ethanol: A Multi-Objective, Life Cycle Approach under Uncertainty, , Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Cambridge, MA; Zah, R., Böni, H., Gauch, M., Hischier, R., Lehmann, M., Wäger, P., (2007) Life Cycle Assessment of Energy Products: Environmental Assessment of Biofuels, , Federal Office of Energy: Bern, Switzerland; Douglas, J., (1988) Conceptual Design of Chemical Processes, , McGraw-Hill Publishing Co, New York; Keoleian, G.A., The application of life cycle assessment to process design (1993) J.
