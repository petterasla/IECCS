Two types of 10-year climate experiments are conducted. One is a present-day climate experiment, and the other is a greenhouse-warmed climate experiment, with a forcing of higher sea surface temperature and increased greenhouse-gas concentration. A comparison of the experiments suggests that the tropical cyclone frequency in the warm-climate experiment is globally reduced by about 30% (but increased in the North Atlantic) compared to the present-day-climate experiment. Furthermore, the number of intense tropical cyclones increases. The maximum surface wind speed for the most intense tropical cyclone generally increases under the greenhouse-warmed condition (by 7.3 m s-1 in the Northern Hemisphere and by 3.3 m s-1 in the Southern Hemisphere). On average, these findings suggest the possibility of higher risks of more devastating tropical cyclones across the globe in a future greenhouse-warmed climate. © 2006, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"climatology; global warming; tropical cyclone; wind velocity",,,,,,"Arakawa, A., Schubert, W.H., Interaction of cumulus cloud ensemble with the large-scale environment (1974) J.
