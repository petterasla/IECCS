Here we show that migration and breeding times of a trans-Saharan migrant, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, closely follow local temperatures along the migration route and at the breeding grounds. Because of differences in long-term temperature trends of short within-spring periods, the migration period and the time interval between migration and breeding dates of this species have extended in SW Finland. Temperatures in northern parts of Central Europe have risen at the time when the first migrants arrive there, facilitating their migration northward. Temperatures later in the spring have not changed, and the last individuals arrive at the same time as before. The timing of breeding has not advanced because temperatures at the breeding site after arrival have not changed. These results show that the pied flycatchers can speed up their migration in response to rising temperatures along the migration route. Our results strongly indicate that the effects of climate change have to be studied at the appropriate time and geographical scales for each species and population concerned. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Ficedula hypoleuca; Local temperature; NAO; Timing of arrival; Timing of breeding","arrival date; breeding; climate change; global warming; migration route; Ficedula; Ficedula hypoleuca",,,,,,"Bairlein, F., Winkel, W., Birds and climate change (2001) Climate of the 21st Century: Changes and Risks, pp. 278-282. , (eds Lozán J, Graßl H, Hupfer P), Dr. J.L.Lozán Wissenschaftliche Auswertungen, Hamburg; Both, C., Visser, M.E., Adjustment to climate change is constrained by arrival date in a long-distance migrant bird (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 296-298; Crick, H.Q.P., Sparks, T.H., Climate change related to egglaying trends (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 423-424; Dunn, P.O., Breeding dates and reproductive performance (2004) Advances in Ecological Research, , in press; Dunn, P.O., Winkler, D.W., Climate change has affected the breeding date of tree swallows throughout North America (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 266, pp. 2487-2490; Eeva, T., Lehikoinen, E., Growth and mortality of nestling great tits (Parus major) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in a heavy metal pollution gradient (1996) Oecologia, 108, pp. 631-639; Forchhammer, M.C., Post, E., Stenseth, N.C., North Atlantic Oscillation timing of long- and short-distance migration (2002) Journal of Animal Ecology, 71, pp. 1002-1014; Gwinner, E., (1986) Endogenous Annual Clocks in the Organization of Seasonal Processes, , Springer, Berlin; Haartman, L.V., Breeding time of the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca (1990) NATO ASI Series, Population Biology of Passerine Birds: an Integrated Approach, G24, pp. 1-16. , (eds Blondel J, Gosler A, Lebreton J-D, McCleery R), Springer-Verlag, Berlin; Harrington, R., Woiwod, I., Sparks, T., Climate change and trophic interactions (1999) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 14, pp. 146-150; Hughes, L., Biological consequences of global warming: Is the signal already apparent?
