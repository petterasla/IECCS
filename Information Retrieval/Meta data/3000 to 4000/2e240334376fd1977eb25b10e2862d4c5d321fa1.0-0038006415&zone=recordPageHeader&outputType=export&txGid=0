These pressures have included concerns over potential impacts of more extremes due to global warming fostered by ever increasing costs to the insurance industry and government from weather extremes; plus a series of massive losses during the past 15 years (drought of 1988-1989, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and Midwestern 1993 floods). These recent assessments attempted to adjust data for societal changes over time and thus derived new and better estimates of losses for seven major extremes than existed previously. Three extremes have annual average losses in excess of a billion dollars (1998 dollars) including hurricanes ($4.2 billion), floods ($3.2 billion), and severe local storms ($1.6 billion). One extreme and its adjusted losses exhibit upward trends (floods), but all others show no increases with time or temporal decreases (hail, hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe thunderstorms). Annual national losses during 1950-1997 from the three major extremes, plus four others (hail, tornadoes, winter storms, and wind storms), collectively reveal no upward or downward trend over time, with an average annual loss of $10.3 billion. The quality loss values do not indicate an increase as has been postulated for global warming. The good news is that better estimates of impacts now exist, but the bad news is that they are still estimates and do not include sizable unmeasured losses. If accurate data on the economic impacts from weather extremes are seen as important for scientific research and policy-making for global warming, the U.S. needs a continuing program to adequately measure losses from weather extremes.","Climate change; Economic impacts; Science policy; Societal change; Weather and climate extremes","climate change; economics; global warming; severe weather; United States",,,,,,"Changnon, D., Changnon, S.A., Evaluation of weather catastrophe data for use in climate change investigations (1998) Climatic Change, 38, pp. 435-445; Changnon, S.A., (1980) Climatology of High Damaging Winds in Illinois, , Report of Investigation 95, Illinois State Water Survey, Champaign, IL; Changnon, S.A., Losers and winners: A summary of the flood's impacts (1996) The Great Flood of 1993, pp. 276-299. , S.
