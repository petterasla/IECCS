Crop evapotranspiration (ET) was measured using two CO2 concentrations (control, c. 370 μmol mol-1; FACE, ambient +200 μmol mol-1) and two irrigation treatments (well watered and water-limited). Volumetric soil water content was measured before and after each irrigation using neutron scattering techniques. Averaged over both years, elevated CO2 reduced cumulative ET by 10% when plants were given ample water and by 4% under severe drought stress. Water-use efficiency based on grain yield (WUE-G) increased, due to CO2 enrichment, by 9% and 19% in wet and dry plots, respectively; based on total biomass, water-use efficiency (WUE-B) increased by 16% and 17% in wet and dry plots, respectively. These data suggest that in the future high-CO2 environment, water requirements for irrigated sorghum will be lower than at present, while dry-land productivity will increase, provided global warming is minimal. © New Phytologist (2001).","Carbon dioxide enrichment; CO2; Evapotranspiration; Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE); Global change; Sorghum bicolor; Water-use effeciency","carbon dioxide enrichment; evapotranspiration; sorghum; water use",,,,,,"Allen L.H., Jr., Effects of increasing carbon dioxide levels and climate change on plant growth, evapotranspiration, and water resources (1990) Managing water resources in the west under conditions of climate uncertainty, pp. 101-147. , Washington DC, USA: National Academy Press; Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., Crop Evapotranspiration, Guidelines for computing crop water requirements (1998) Food and agriculture organization of the United Nations, irrigation and drainage paper 56, pp. 100-111. , Rome, Italy: Viale delle Terme di Caracalla; Brown, P.W., (1987) User's guide to the Arizona Metorological Network, , Phoenix, AZ, USA: City of Phoenix, Water Conservation and Research Division and Arizona Cooperative Extension; Brown, P.W., Yitayew, M., Near-real time weather information for irrigation management in Arizona (1988) Planning now for irrigation and drainage in the 21st century: proceedings of a conference: irrigation and drainage division of the American society of civil engineers, pp. 708-715. , Hay DR, ed.
