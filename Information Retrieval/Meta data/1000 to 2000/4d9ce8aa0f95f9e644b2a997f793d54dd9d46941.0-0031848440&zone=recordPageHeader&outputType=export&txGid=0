We measured changes in soil C following afforestation of sugarcane fields with fast-growing Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.) plantations in Hawaii. Using stable C isotopes, we estimated the contributions to changes in total soil C that were due to the loss of C from the prior cane cultivation, and to the gain of C from the new Eucalyptus plantations. Total soil C 10-13 yr after afforestation was 114 and 113 Mg/ha, respectively, in the Eucalyptus and cane plantation. Eucalyptus increased total soil C in the 0-10 cm layer by 11.5 Mg/ha, but that was offset by a loss of 10.1 Mg/ha of cane-derived C from the 10-55 cm layer. The net effect on soil C of afforestation of cultivated lands depends not only on new C gained, but also on C lost from the previous management.","Afforestation; Eucalyptus; Global climate change; Hawaii; Land use; Soil carbon; Stable carbon isotope ratios; Sugarcane plantations","afforestation; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; soil carbon; United States, Hawaii; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus saligna",,,,,,"Boutton, T.W., Stable carbon isotope ratios of natural materials: II.
