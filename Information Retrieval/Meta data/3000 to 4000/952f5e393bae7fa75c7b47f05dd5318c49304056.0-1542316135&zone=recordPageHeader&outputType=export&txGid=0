The transportation sector generates more than one-third of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in New York and represents the fastest-growing source of GHG emissions in the state. A summary of the recommendations of the New York Greenhouse Gas Task Force for reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector is provided. Using a bottom-up analytical approach, the Center for Clean Air Policy - with advice from the task force - determined that New York can reduce transportation-sector emissions by 1.64 million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) in 2010 (total emissions 20.9% above 1990 levels) and by 5.23 MMTCE in 2020 (total emissions 16.5 % above 1990 levels) by implementing the task force's recommendations. Achieving significant reductions in GHG emissions from transportation requires a comprehensive package of complementary measures, including shifting funding to more GHG-efficient alternatives such as transit and smart growth, adopting GHG emissions standards for light-duty vehicles (upon implementation in California), creating an indigenous biofuels program, and considering policy mechanisms to increase freight efficiency and high-speed rail options. To facilitate the implementation of these measures, the establishment of a state entity for reducing transportation-sector emissions is recommended with a goal of reducing transportation GHG emissions to 20% above 1990 levels by 2010, 10% above 1990 levels by 2020, and 1990 levels by 2030.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Freight transportation; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Global warming; Railroad transportation; Standards; Synthetic fuels; Fuel carbon content; Greenhouse gas emissions; Light-duty vehicles; Vehicle miles traveled; Motor transportation",,,,,,"(2003) Recommendations to Governor Pataki for Reducing New York State Greenhouse Gas Emissions, , Final Draft.
