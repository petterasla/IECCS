It brings together satellite data, an ecosystem simulation model (NASA-CASA), spatial linear models with autoregression, and a GIS to provide practitioners a low-cost, accessible ecosystem monitoring and analysis system (EMAS) at landscape resolutions. The EMAS is evaluated and assessed with an application example in Yellowstone National Park aimed at identifying the causes and consequences of drought. Utilizing five predictor covariates (solar radiation, burn severity, soil productivity, temperature, and precipitation), spatio-temporal analysis revealed how landscape controls and climate (summer vegetation moisture stress) affected patterns of NPP according to vegetation functional type, species cover type, and successional stage. These results supported regional and national trends of NPP in relation to carbon fluxes and lag effects of climate. Overall, the EMAS provides valuable decision support for PAs regarding informed land use planning, conservation programs, vital sign monitoring, control programs (fire fuels, invasives, etc.), and restoration efforts. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Ecosystem indicators; MODIS; NASA-CASA; NPP; Spatio-temporal analysis; Vegetation moisture stress","Application examples; Autoregression; Burn severities; Carbon fluxes; Conservation programs; Control programs; Covariates; Cover types; Decision supports; Ecosystem indicators; Ecosystem monitoring; Environmental changes; Fire fuels; Functional types; Lag effects; Land-use planning; Linear models; Modeling and analysis; MODIS; Net primary productivities; NPP; Protected areas; Satellite datum; Simulation models; Soil productivities; Spatio-temporal analysis; Successional stages; Vital signs; Yellowstone national parks; Decision support systems; Drought; Forestry; Land use; Moisture control; NASA; Parks; Photosynthesis; Regression analysis; Spectrometers; Sun; Vegetation; Ecosystems; bioindicator; climate effect; drought; ecosystem modeling; environmental change; environmental monitoring; GIS; land use planning; MODIS; net primary production; protected area; spatial analysis; succession; temporal analysis; North America; United States; Yellowstone National Park",,,,,,"Amthor, J.S., Chen, J.M., Clein, J.S., Frolking, S.E., Goulden, M.L., Grant, R.F., Boreal forest CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration predicted by nine ecosystem process models: Inter-model comparisons and relations to field measurements (2001) Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, pp. 33, 623-33, 648; The great divide: the gap between theory and practice remains surprisingly wide in conservation biology (editorial) (2007) Nature, 450, p. 136; Bivand, R.S., Pebesma, E.J., Gomez-Rubio, V., Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R (Use R).
