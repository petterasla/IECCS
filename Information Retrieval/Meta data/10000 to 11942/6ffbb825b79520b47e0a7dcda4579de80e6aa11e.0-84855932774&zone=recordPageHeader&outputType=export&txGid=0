The study used a hybrid life-cycle-assessment approach to build life-cycle models for the various technologies, including manufacturing and installation data for process models and energy supply and input-output data to complete life-cycle models. Three different electricity scenarios were used to examine the sensitivity of the impacts to changes in energy supply: the United States average mix, the regional mix for the ReliabilityFirst Corporation region, and a scenario with 100% wind power. The results show that for all technologies, the impacts of electricity in the use phase dominates the results. Because of their lower wattage, light-emitting diode (LED) and induction technology perform favorably and similarly. With anticipated improvements in technology, however, LEDs are expected to be more efficient than induction in the near future and have lower environmental impacts by the time that Pittsburgh and other cities buy and install lights as part of these streetlight projects, which have the potential to show large cost and emissions savings. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Artificial; Environmental issues; Global warming; Life cycles; Light; Urban areas","Artificial; Energy supplies; Environmental issues; High-pressure sodiums; Input-output data; Life cycle model; Life-cycle assessments; Lighting technology; Pittsburgh; Process model; Urban areas; Use Phase; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Light; Light emission; Metal halides; Retrofitting; Sodium; Technology; Wind power; Light emitting diodes; environmental impact; environmental issue; global warming; input-output analysis; life cycle analysis; urban area; Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh; United States",,,,,,"Bare, J., The tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts (2002) J.
