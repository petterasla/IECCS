During the 13-days that the SOIREE bloom was monitored, export fluxes within the iron-fertilised patch were not substantially different to those in waters outside the bloom. On days 11-13, iron enrichment may have caused particle transformations that could lead to elevated future export via particle aggregation and/or diatom chain formation. The unknown time-lag between increased production and export, the longevity of the SOIREE bloom, and the absence of nutrient limitation over days 1-13, however, prohibit prediction of any iron-induced export. This conclusion highlights the difficulties of fully testing the ""Iron Hypothesis"" and for evaluating the implications for global climate change.",,"Climate change; Fluxes; Iron; Organic compounds; Sediments; Biogeochemical measurements; Geophysics; algal bloom; biogeochemistry; iron; particulate organic carbon; phytoplankton; Southern Ocean",,,,,,"Abraham, E.R., Law, C.S., Boyd, P.W., Lavender, S.J., Maldonado, M.T., Bowie, A.R., Importance of stirring in the development of an iron-fertilized phytoplankton bloom (2000) Nature, 407, pp. 727-730; Berger, W., Wefer, G., Export production: Seasonality and intermittency, and paleoceanographic implications (1990) Palaeogeogr.
