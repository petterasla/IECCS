Box 5182, Amman, 11183, Jordan","The potential impact of global climate change is one of the least addressed factors in water resources planning in developing countries. The potential impacts of climate change are examined for Jordan, where a methodology is presented for improved management of water demand under the uncertainties associated with climate change. A temperature/precipitation sensitivity model is constructed and combined with water demand forecasts to project deficits for the year 2020. Deficit reducing options are then evaluated in terms of social and economic viability. The study concludes that only some of the deficits may be alleviated, illustrating the significance of considering climate change in planning for countries that already experience water imbalances.","Climate change; Jordan; Water deficits; Water resources management",,,,,,,"Abu-Taleb, M., The Use of Infiltration Field Tests for Groundwater Artificial Recharge (1999) Environmental Geology, 37, pp. 64-71; Abu-Taleb, M., Murad, M., Use of Focus Groups and Surveys to Evaluate Impacts of Water Conservation Campaign (1999) ASCE Journal of Water Management and Planning, 125 (2), pp. 94-99; Abu-Taleb, M., Mareschal, B., Water Resources Planning in the Middle East: Application of the Promethee V Multicriteria Method (1995) European Journal of Operational Research, 81, pp. 500-511; Abu-Taleb, M., Salameh, E., Environmental Management in Jordan: Problems and Recommendations (1994) Environmental Conservation, 21 (1), pp. 35-40; Abu-Taleb, M., Deason, J., Salameh, E., Mareschal, B., Multiobjective Decision Support for Water Resources Planning (1992) Jordan's Water Resources and Their Future Potential, pp. 79-97. , A.
