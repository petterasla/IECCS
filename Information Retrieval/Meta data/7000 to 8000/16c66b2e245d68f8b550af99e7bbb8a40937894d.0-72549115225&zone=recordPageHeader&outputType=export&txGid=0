These activities all use energy and fuels, primarily of fossil origin. Electricity and fuel consumptions of the individual processes were reviewed and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions were quantified. The emission factors were assigned a global warming potential (GWP) and aggregated into global warming factors (GWFs), which express the potential contribution to global warming from collection, transport and transfer of 1 tonne of wet waste. Six examples involving collection, transfer and transport of waste were assessed in terms of GHG emissions, including both provision and use of energy. (GHG emissions related to production, maintenance and disposal of vehicles, equipment, infrastructure and buildings were excluded.) The estimated GWFs varied from 9.4 to 368 kg CO2-equivalent (kg CO2-eq.) per tonne of waste, depending on method of collection, capacity and choice of transport equipment, and travel distances. The GHG emissions can be reduced primarily by avoiding transport of waste in private cars and by optimization of long distance transport, for example, considering transport by rail and waterways.","CO2 accounting; Collection; Global warming; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Transfer stations; Transport; Waste","Collection; Emission factors; GHG emission; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Long-distance transport; Private cars; Transport equipment; Travel distance; Waste management systems; Energy conversion; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Transfer stations; Waste management; emissions trading; energy use; estimation method; global warming; greenhouse gas; waste management; air pollution; container; electricity; energy consumption; environmental parameters; exhaust gas; global warming factor; global warming potential; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; incineration; priority journal; recycling; review; traffic and transport; waste disposal; waste management; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Refuse Disposal; Transportation",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"(2004) Lifecycle-assessment Database Developed by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency in 1996, 2nd Update, , Edip (Environmental Design of Industrial Products) EDIP, Copenhagen, Denmark; Commision, E., (2005) Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, Draft Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for the Waste Treatment Industries, Final Draft May 2005, , European Commission, Brussels, Belgium; Facanha, C., Horvath, A., Evaluation of life-cycle air emission factors of freight transportation (2007) Environmental Science & Technology, 41, pp. 7138-7144; Fisher, K., Impact of Energy from Waste and Recycling Policy on UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Final Report Prepared by Environment Resource Management (ERM) for Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), , http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WR0609_5737_FRP.pdf; Fruergaard, T., Ekvall, T., Astrup, T., (2009) Energy use and recovery in waste management and implications for accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 724-737; (2005) Determination of the Impact of Waste Management Activities on Greenhouse Gas Emissions, , ICF. 2005 Update, ICF Consulting, Toronto, Canada; Iriarte, A., Gabarrell, X., Rieradevall, J., (2009) LCA of selective waste collection systems in dense urban areas Waste Management, 29, pp. 903-914; Larsen, A.W., Vrgoc, M., Lieberknecht, P., Christensen, T.H., (2009) Diesel consumption in waste collection and transport and its environmental significance Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 652-659; Larsen, A.W., Møller, J., Merrild, H., Christensen, T.H., Projekt 2: Vurdering af fremtidige indsamlingssystemer for husholdningsaffald i Ã...rhus Kommune.
