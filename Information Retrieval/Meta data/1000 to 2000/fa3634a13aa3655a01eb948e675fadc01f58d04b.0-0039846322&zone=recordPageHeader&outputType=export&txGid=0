In this paper, results of intercalibration of the newly developed VISSR for GMS-5 and NOAA-14 AVHRR are described. The method is based on collocated clear radiance observations with GMS-5 VISSR and NOAA-14 AVHRR. The results of the correlation analysis of the data of IR channels 1 and 2 of GMS-5 VISSR and those of channels 4 and 5 of NOAA-14 AVHRR indicate the following features. The observed brightness temperature with IR channel 1 of VISSR is about 0.8K-1.5K colder than that with channel 4 of AVHRR, while that with IR channel 2 is about 0.1K-1.0K warmer than that with channel 5 of AVHRR. The result of adjustment on working spectral response function and atmospheric correction indicates that the adjusted brightness temperatures with IR channels 1 and 2 of VISSR are about 1K colder than that with channels 4 and 5 of AVHRR. Thus this result shows IR channels 1 and 2 on GMS-5 indicate a certain disagreement with channels 4 and 5 of NOAA-14 AVHRR. © 1999 COSPAR.
