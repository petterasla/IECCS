Large fire activity had increased in Canadian and Alaskan forests during the last four decades of the 20th century. Here we combined the Palmer Drought Severity Index and historical large fire databases to demonstrate that Canada and Alaska forest regions experienced summer drying over this time period, and drought during the fire season significantly affected forest fire activity in these regions. Climatic warming, positive geopotential height anomalies and ocean circulation patterns were spatially and temporally convolved in causing drought conditions, which in turn enhanced fuel flammability and thereby indirectly affected fire activity. Future fire regimes will likely depend on drought patterns under global climate change scenarios. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Boreal forest; Drought; Fire","Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Drought; Ecosystems; Global warming; Boreal forests; Carbon dioxide emissions; Drought conditions; Forestry industry; Geopotential height anomalies; Global climate changes; Ocean circulation; Palmer drought severity indices; Fires",,,,,,"Agresti, A., (2002) Categorical Data Analysis, pp. 43-44; Amiro, B.D., Al, E., Direct carbon emissions from Canadian forest fires 1959 to 1999 (2001) Can.
