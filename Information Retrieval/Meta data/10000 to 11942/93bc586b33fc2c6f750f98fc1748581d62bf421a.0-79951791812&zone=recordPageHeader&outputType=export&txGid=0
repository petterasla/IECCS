The same materials present the Green function expressions of these models in terms of this exponential approximation, i.e., in the form of a sum of exponents. The uncertainties that occur when the Green function is substituted by its exponential approximation are investigated. The reason of such an analysis is a classic conclusion that a general problem of the exponential approximation refers to the class of inconsistent problems. © 2011 Allerton Press, Inc.",,"Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric CO; Carbon cycle models; Exponential analysis; Exponential approximations; Green function; Greenhouse gases emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Exponential functions; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; global warming; Green function; greenhouse gas",,,,,,"Antonovskii, M.Y., Bukhshtaber, V.M., Pivovarov, V.A., Analysis of Uncertainties in Assessing the Contribution of Different Greenhouse Gas Emissions to Global Warming (1998) Meteorol.
