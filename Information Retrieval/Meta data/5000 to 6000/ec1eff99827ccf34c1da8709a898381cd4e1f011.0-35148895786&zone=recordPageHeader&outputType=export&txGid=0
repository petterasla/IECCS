Experimental evidence from satellites, aircraft, and ground-based sensors indicates that both lines of evidence support the hypothesis of increased heat retention (5-9). While recent increases in the observed global average surface temperature have been small - approximately 0.17 °C per decade (9) - worldwide observations of melting ice have been more conspicuous (5-7, 10). At the present time, the directly observed melting of surface ice indicates more strongly than the observed temperature increases that the earth has entered into an era of increasing greenhouse effects. Students who have completed the laboratory exercise described here have emerged with a stronger understanding of these key issues and are able to connect them to the simple calorimetric principles that are typically covered in most first-year chemistry courses.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Calorimetry; Chemistry; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Calorimetric experiment; Chemical education; Global heat retention; Surface temperature; Education",,,,,,"(2003) Climate Change Information Kit, , http://unfccc.int/essential_background/ background_publications_htmlpdf/climate_change_information_kit/items/ 305.php, United Nations Environment Programme, accessed Jun; (2006) Chemistry in Context: Applying Chemistry to Society, , 5th ed, Eubanks, L.
