As a part of this project, the litter carbon dynamics were investigated at three Acacia aneura forest sites, using a litter carbon model incorporating the physical removal of litter by winds, floods, etc. Based on the field observation data of above ground plant biomass, annual litter fall, existing amount of the litter, and also litter decomposition rate constants separately obtained for leaf litter and woody litter, we investigated the carbon flows at these forest sites, especially the annual amount of litter physically removed from the sites by floods or winds. As a result, it is estimated that annual physical removal of litter amounted to 59-75% of the annual litter fall, and the litter removal rate constants were from 0.38 to 0.55 year-1. Roughly one third to a half of the existing litter is removed annually from the sites. There was also a tendency that as the canopy coverage decreases, the litter removal rate constant increases. For this type of ecosystem, which is susceptible to the run-off of water and strong winds, we consider the taking into account of the physical removal of the litter is essential for analyzing the carbon dynamics in the ecosystem. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
