T6G 2E9, Canada","In the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western continental Canada, permafrost is limited almost exclusively to ombrotrophic peatlands. Permafrost in peatlands recently has been degrading and continues to degrade at its southern limit across western Canada, with no evidence of regeneration. The melting of permafrost could have dramatic effects on organic matter accumulation, organochemical properties, and nutrient status in peatlands. Our objectives are to quantify differences in peat chemistry (i.e., concentrations of organic fractions, N, P, and S) and rates of organic matter accumulation over the past 200 years between a site with permafrost, a site with degraded permafrost (internal lawn), and three sites with no evidence of permafrost since the last glaciation (continental peatlands: two bogs and one poor fen). Results indicate that peat chemistry may differ according to the presence, absence, or degradation of permafrost. Recent rates of organic matter accumulation follow similar trends over the past 100-200 years in the permafrost and continental bogs; however, net rates of organic matter accumulation are accelerated by 60% in the internal lawn. As decomposition in peatlands is influenced by nutrient limitations and organic matter quality, peat chemistry is likely to be a critical factor in the carbon balance response of boreal peatlands to climate change.","210Pb-dating; Alberta; Boreal forest; Carbon; Carbon quality; Discontinuous permafrost zone; Global climate change; Nutrients; Peatlands; Permafrost","climate change; melting; organic matter; peatland; permafrost; soil chemistry; Canada",,,,,,"Appleby, P.G., Oldfield, F.R., The assessment of 210Pb data from sites with varying sediment accumulation rates (1978) Hydrobiologia, 103, pp. 29-35; Appleby, P.G., Shotyk, W., Fankhauser, A., Lead-210 age dating of three peat cores in the Jura Mountains, Switzerland (1997) Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 100, pp. 223-231; Bellisario, L.M., Moore, T.R., Net ecosystem CO2 exchange in a Boreal peatland, northern Manitoba (1998) Ecoscience, 5, pp. 534-541; Belyea, L.R., Warner, B.G., Dating of the near-surface layer of a peatland in northeastern Ontario, Canada (1994) Boreas, 23, pp. 259-269; Belyea, L.R., Warner, B.G., Temporal scale and the accumulation of peat in a Sphagnum bog (1994) Canadian Journal of Botany, 74, pp. 366-377; Benninger, L.K., Lewis, D.M., Turekian, K.K., The use of natural Pb-210 as a heavy metal tracer in the river-estuarine system (1975) Marine Chemistry in the Coastal Environment, American Chemical Society Symposium, Series N18, pp. 202-210. , in T.
