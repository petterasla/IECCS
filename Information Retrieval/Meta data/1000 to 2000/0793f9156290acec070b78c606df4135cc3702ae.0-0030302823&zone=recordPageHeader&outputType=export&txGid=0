The model predicts that three of 14 boreal mammals will go extinct regionally and that four of 19 mountain ranges will lose upwards of 50% of their present faunas. Here, we re-examine the model on the basis of its underlying assumptions, on the statistical and biogeographic protocols used, and on its predictive power. A key assumption, that populations of these small mammals are isolated by absolute barriers to dispersal, is challenged by published field observations and by extensive trapping records. Statistical procedures used to construct the model are questionable and the model itself yields imprecise estimates. The biogeographic principle used to identify extinction-prone species, nested subsets of species, makes predictions that are at odds with available autecological information. The demonstration of a nested pattern of species occurrences does not provide definitive evidence in resolving SLOSS or whether a single large island or several small islands of equivalent total area will contain more species. We conclude that the model is not a reliable method for forecasting species extinctions following global warming. The final resolution of the biogeography of montane mammals (and predictive models of extinction) in the Great Basin must await a full and accurate accounting of past and present species distributions.","biogeographic theory; global warming; montane mammals; nested species distributions; SLOSS","climatic change; extinction; island biogeography; mammal; modelling; mountain environment; Mammalia",,,,,,"Abbott, I., Factors determining the number of land bird species on islands around South-Western Australia (1978) Oecol., 33, pp. 221-233; Atmar, W., Patterson, B.D., The measure of order and disorder in the distribution of species in fragmented habitat (1993) Oecol., 96, pp. 373-382; Beckon, W.N., The effect of insularity on the diversity of land birds in the Fiji Islands: Implications for refuge design (1993) Oecol., 94, pp. 318-329; Boecklen, W.J., Effects of habitat heterogeneity on the species-area relationships of forest birds (1986) J.
