Proponents argue that sizable reductions are necessary as a hedge against unacceptably rapid changes in climate. This paper provides a decision tree analysis of the problem. We examine how the optimal hedging strategy might vary with: a) the damage potential associated with the continued buildup of greenhouse gases; b) the accuracy and timing of climate research; and, c) the prospects for new supply and conservation technologies. The analysis is from the perspective of a single country, the USA. Optimal hedging strategies need to be explored on a region-by-region basis. © 1991.","Decision analysis; Global warming; Value of information","carbon dioxide; climatic change; decision tree analysis; emission control; greenhouse effect; hedging strategy; pollution problem; USA",,,,,,"Manne, Richels, CO2 emission limits: an economic cost analysis for the USA (1990) The Energy Journal, 11 (2); National Research Council, (1990) Confronting Climate Change, , National Academy Press, Washington, DC, USA; Hogan, Jorgenson, (1990) Productivity Trends and the Cost of Reduction CO2 Emissions, , For arguments supporting lower AEEI values see, Energy and Environmental Policy Center, Harvard University, MA, USA; Williams, Low cost strategies for coping with CO2 emission limits (1990) The Energy Journal, 11 (4), pp. 35-59. , for a contrary view, see","Manne, A.S.; Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026313907
