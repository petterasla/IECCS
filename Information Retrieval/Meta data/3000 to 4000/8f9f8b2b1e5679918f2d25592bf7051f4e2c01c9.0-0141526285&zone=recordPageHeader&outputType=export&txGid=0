Since start-up time of dispersed generation systems is short, it is possible to operate systems to supply load power corresponding to a demand. Moreover, PPSs (Power Producers and Suppliers) can participate in a power retail sales company, since deregulation of electric utilities was instituted in March 2000. However, PPSs have to keep instantaneous generating power commissioning rule, to maintain supply-and-demand balance between customer and supplier. Therefore, in this paper, we examine instantaneous generating power commissioning for dispersed generators where start-up time is short and it is possible to operate systems to supply a power load corresponding to a demand. We adopt a PI controller as a controller. The system is composed of double control loop in inner loop and in outer loop. In inner loop electric power is controlled and in outer loop electric energy is controlled. The controller parameters are designed using the pole-placement technique. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is confirmed by simulations. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Dispersed generators; Load-following control; PI control","Control equipment; Electric generators; Electric load management; Electric power transmission; Dispersed generators; Electric power generation",,,,,,"Kuwayama, Economical operation and planning of dispersed co-generation plants with consideration for power storage (1997) Trans IEE Japan, 117 B, pp. 19-26; Kim, Critical scheduling of dispersed generators from the standpoint of voltage control in power distribution system (1996) Trans IEE Japan, 116 B, pp. 1461-1469; Tamura, Optimal operation of dispersed co-generation plants with account for coordination with boilers (1994) Trans IEE Japan, 114 B, pp. 1243-1249; Sekine, Transient Analysis of Power Systems, pp. 111-112. , Ohm Press","Senjyu, T.; University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan",,,,,,,,04247760,,EENJA,,"English","Electr Eng Jpn",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141526285
