A number of initiatives have been started to evolve the method and to produce biofuels from algae. Now, Associated Cement Companies Ltd. ACC, under the APP6 project, is going to develop a method for the use of biomass for kiln firing by developing a design for a bioreactor to utilize the CO2 from its cement plants and produce oil bearing algae.",,,,,,,,"Bayless, D.J., (2002) Enhanced Practical Photosynthetic CO 2 Mitigation, , http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/01/ carbon_seq/5a4.pdf; De Boer, A.
