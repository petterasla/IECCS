At some travel destinations, climate represents the natural resource on which the tourism industry is predicated. Global climate change has the potential to alter the distribution of climate assets among tourism destinations, with implications for tourism seasonality, demand and travel patterns. Changes in the length and quality of the tourism season have considerable implications for the long-term profitability of tourism enterprises and competitive relationships between destinations. This analysis utilizes a 'tourism climate index' (TCI) that incorporates 7 climate variables relevant to general tourism activities (i.e. sightseeing) to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of climate resources for tourism in North America under baseline conditions (1961-1990) and 2 climate change scenarios (CGCM2-B2 and HadCM3-A1F1) for the 2050s and 2080s. The analysis found that a substantive redistribution of climate resources for tourism will be possible in the later decades of the 21st century, particularly in the warmer and wetter HadCM3-A1F1 scenario. The number of cities in the USA with 'excellent' or 'ideal' TCI ratings (TCI > 80) in the winter months is likely to increase, so that southern Florida and Arizona could face increasing competition for winter sun holiday travelers and the seasonal 'snowbird' market (retirees from Canada and the northern states of the USA, who spend 2 to 6 mo in winter peak and optimal climate destinations). In contrast, lower winter TCI ratings in Mexico suggest it could become less competitive as a winter sun holiday destination. In Canada, a longer and improved warm-weather tourism season may enhance its competitiveness in the international tourism marketplace, with potentially positive implications for its current international tourism account deficit. © Inter-Research 2004.","Climate change; North America; Tourism; Tourism climate index","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Profitability; Statistics; climate change; climate effect; competitiveness; profitability; seasonality; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; tourism market; tourist attraction; tourist destination; travel behavior; Canada; North America; United States",,,,,,"Agnew, M., Tourism (1995) Economic impacts of the hot summer and unusually warm year of 1995, Department of the Environment Report, pp. 139-147. , Palutikof J, Subak S, Agnew M eds, Norwich, p; Becker, S., Bioclimatological rating of cities and resorts in South Africa according to the climate index (2000) Int J Climatol, 20, pp. 1403-1414; Besancenot, J., Mouiner, J., De Lavenne, F., Les conditions climatiques du tourisme littoral (1978) Norois, 99, pp. 357-382; Boniface, B., Cooper, C., (1994) The geography of travel and tourism, , Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford; Boyd, W., Bulter, R., Haider, W., Perera, A., Identifying areas for ecotourism in northern Ontario: Application of a GIS methodology (1994) J Appl Recreation Res, 19, pp. 41-66; Burnet, L., (1963) Villégiature et tourisme sur les côtes de la, , France.
