The UK has launched the first nationwide GWG emissions trading program covering several industrial sectors, while Denmark has proposed a pilot trading scheme incorporating the country's nine largest energy users. The European commission introduced proposals in 2001 for a pan-European CO2 emissions trading system that would begin in 2005. The chemical industry has been successful in reducing GWG emission, which is about 30 percent since 1990s.",,"Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Environmental impact; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Nitrogen oxides; Public policy; Societies and institutions; Sulfur dioxide; Du Pont (CO); European Union; GWG emissions trading program; Kyoto Protocol; Shell (CO); Gas emissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0009272X,,CHWKA,,"English","Chem Week",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-23044434446
