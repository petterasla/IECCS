Under these circumstances, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is expected to play a significant role, since it promises to reduce the economic gaps between developed and developing nations, as well as to economically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we first investigate how to evaluate risks in CDM. The real option theory is applied to quantify project risks in CDM, so that we can estimate the option values. In detail, a mathematical model of CDM is represented with a compound rainbow option, which includes continuous procedures from registration to investment. The evaluated results identify the condition of profitability, in which investment as CDM project is feasible. Our evaluation also quantifies how CDM projects become difficult to be executed due to the registration risk and the post-2012 risk. Then we investigate how to activate CDM projects. For this purpose, two options are considered: low interest loans by official financial institutions and the procurement of certified emission reductions, (CERs) by governments. The former relates to the low interest loans similar to environmental official development assistance (ODA), which certainly ease the financial burden of initial investments in CDM projects. Now that CDM projects related to ODA are already registered by CDM executive board, this option is worth evaluation. The latter, meanwhile, aims at lowering risks by the secure purchase of CERs by governments. Since the governments of the Netherlands and Japan have already established a system to purchase CERs generated by CDM, we need to assess the effect of the option to activate CDM. Based on actual financial data on CDM, we finally investigate how these options could increase the number of executable CDM projects. © 2009 ISEIS.","CER procurement; Clean development mechanism; Compound rainbow option; Low interest loan; Risk management","clean development mechanism; developing world; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; interest rate; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; investment; national economy; numerical model; profitability; risk assessment; Japan; Netherlands",,,,,,"Copeland, T., Antikarov, V., (2002) Real Options, p. 167. , Toyo Keizai Shimposha; (2006), http://gecjp/gec/gec.nsf/jp/Activities-Feasibility_Studies_on_Climate_Change_Mitigation_Projects_for_CDM_and_JI-DB-List1, Global Environment Centre FoundationKittaka, M., Trend on CDM and on emissions trade (2007) Journal of Japan Center For Environmental Information Science, 36 (3), pp. 49-54; Krey, M., Transaction costs of unilateral CDM projects in India-results from an empirical survey (2007) Energy Policy, 33, pp. 2385-2397. , doi:10.1016/j.enpol.2004.05.008; Imai, J., (2004) Real Options, pp. 110-115. , Chuo Keizaisha, Tokyo; Maeda, A., Characteristics on cost of AIJ emission reduction projects (2006) Proceedings of The 24th Conference On Energy System, Economics and Environment, pp. 609-612. , Tokyo; Matsuhashi, R., Fujisawa, S., Mitamura, W., Momobayashi, Y., Yoshida, Y., CDM projects and portfolio risks (2004) Energy, 29, pp. 1579-1588; Matsuhashi, R., Oda, J., Yoshida, Y., Study on institutions to activate CDM projects (2005) Proceedings of The 7th International Conference On Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies, pp. 2453-2457; (2006) Standard Textbook of Cdm/ Ji Version 2.0, p. 89. , Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry; Credits Acquirement of Kyoto Mechanisms, , http://www.nedo.go.jp/informations/koubo/180721_6/180721_6.html, New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Oorganization 1 (2006); (2006), http://www.infoc.nedo.go.jp/udb/dbindex.html, NEDO 2(2006), http://carbonfinance.org, Prototype Carbon FundPyndyck, R.S., Irreversibility, Uncertainty, and Investment (1991) J.
