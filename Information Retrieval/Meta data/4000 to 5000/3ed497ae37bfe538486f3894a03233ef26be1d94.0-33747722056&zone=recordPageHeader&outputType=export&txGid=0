Annual censuses of reef fish community structure over a 12-year period spanning the bleaching event revealed a marked phase shift from a prebleach to postbleach assemblage. Surprisingly, we found that the bleaching event had no detectable effect on the abundance, diversity or species richness of a local cryptobenthic reef fish community. Furthermore, there is no evidence of regeneration even after 5-35 generations of these short-lived species. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the response of coral reef ecosystems to global warming and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate criteria for evaluating reef resilience. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bleaching; Community composition; Coral reefs; Fishes; Habitat loss; Phase shifts; Resilience","abundance; community composition; coral bleaching; coral reef; fish; habitat loss; species diversity; species richness; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Ackerman, J.L., Bellwood, D.R., Reef fish assemblages: A re-evaluation using enclosed rotenone stations (2000) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 206, pp. 227-237; Ackerman, J.L., Bellwood, D.R., Comparative efficiency of clove oil and rotenone for sampling tropical reef fish assemblages (2002) Journal of Fish Biology, 60, pp. 893-901; Ackerman, J.L., Bellwood, D.R., Brown, J.H., The contribution of small individuals to density-body size relationships: Examination of energetic equivalence in reef fishes (2004) Oecologia, 139, pp. 568-571; Agardy, T., Alder, J., Dayton, P., Coastal Systems (2005) Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Vol. 1 Current State and Trends, pp. 513-549. , In: (eds Hassan R, Scholes R, Ash N), Island Press, Washington; Allen, G.R., (1991) Damselfishes of the World, , Mergus, Hans A.
