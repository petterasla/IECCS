However, water network synthesis has been focused on reducing the consumption and cost of freshwater within each industrial plant. The objective of this study is to illustrate the necessity of the cooperation of industrial plants to reduce the total carbon footprint of their water supply systems. A mathematical optimization model to minimize global warming potentials is developed to synthesize (1) a cooperative water network system (WNS) integrated over two plants and (2) an individual WNS consisting of two WNSs separated for each plant. The cooperative WNS is compared to the individual WNS. The cooperation reduces their carbon footprint and is economically feasible and profitable. A strategy for implementing the cooperation is suggested for the fair distribution of costs and benefits. As a consequence, industrial plants should cooperate with their neighbor plants to further reduce the carbon footprint. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Global optimization; Global warming; Mathematical models; Water management; Water supply systems; Fair distribution; Global warming potentials; Mathematical optimization model; Total carbon; Water networks; Industrial plants; carbon; carbon dioxide; comparative study; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; mitigation; numerical model; optimization; water supply; article; electric power plant; greenhouse effect; mathematical model; water supply; Carbon; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Effect; Industry; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Fiaschi, D., Carta, R., CO2 abatement by co-firing of natural gas and biomass-derived gas in a gas turbine (2007) Energy, 32, pp. 549-567; Otto, V., Reilly, J., Directed technical change and the adoption of CO2 abatement technology: The case of CO2 capture and storage Energy Econ, , In press; Goyal, H.B., Seal, D., Saxena, R.C., Bio-fuels from thermochemical conversion of renewable resources: A review (2008) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev, 12, pp. 504-517; Blesl, M., Das, A., Fahl, U., Remme, U., Role of energy efficiency standards in reducing CO2 emissions in Germany: An assessment with TIMES (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 772-785; Chen, W., Carbon quota price and CDM potentials after Marrakesh (2003) Energy Policy, 31, pp. 709-719; Christen, K., The carbon footprint of transportation fuels (2007) Environ.
