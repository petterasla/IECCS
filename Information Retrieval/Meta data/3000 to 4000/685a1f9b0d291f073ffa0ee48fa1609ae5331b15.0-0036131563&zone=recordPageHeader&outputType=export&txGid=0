Londonderry, BT52 1SA, United Kingdom","Worldwide reactions to the debates on global warming and ozone depletion have led to social responses and legislative measures which have serious implications for refrigeration and associated industries. This paper discusses the problems to be faced, and the ways in which the industry can contribute to meeting the wider global objectives. The discussion considers the choice and availability of working fluids, the increased complexity of using fluid mixtures, and the risk of losing the simplicity in design and construction which was possible with CFC single fluids. Education and training are presented as issues because of the changes in technology. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and IIR.
