Location East coast of Australia. Methods Four latitudes within the 1150 km coastal distribution of Acacia falcata were selected. The insect assemblage on the host plant Acacia falcata was sampled seasonally over two years. Congeneric plant species were also sampled at the sites. Results Ninety-eight species of phytophagous Hemiptera were collected from A. falcata. Total species richness was significantly lower at the most temperate latitude compared to the three more tropical latitudes. We classified species into four climate change response groups depending on their latitudinal range and apparent host specificity. Pairwise comparisons between groups showed that the cosmopolitan, generalist feeders and specialists had a similar community structure to each other, but the climate generalists had a significantly different structure. Fifty-seven species were identified as rare. Most of these rare species were phloem hoppers and their removal from the dataset led to changes in the proportional representation of all guilds in two groups: the specialist and generalist feeders. Main conclusions We found no directional increase in phytophagous Hemiptera species richness. This indicates that, at least in the short term, species richness patterns of these communities may be similar to that found today. As the climate continues to change, however, we might expect some increases in species richness at the more temperate latitudes as species migrate in response to shifting climate zones. In the longer term, more substantial changes in community composition will be expected because the rare species, which comprise a large fraction of these communities, will be vulnerable to both direct climatic changes, and indirect effects via changes to their host's distribution. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Acacia; Community structure; Environmental gradient; Global warming; Guild structure; Heteroptera; Homoptera; Insect herbivores; Rare species; Temperature","climate change; community structure; global warming; latitudinal gradient; species richness; Australasia; Australia; Eastern Hemisphere; World; Acacia; Auchenorrhyncha; Hemiptera; Heteroptera; Insecta",,,,,,"Andrew, N.R., Hughes, L., Species diversity and structure of phytophagous beetle assemblages along a latitudinal gradient: predicting the potential impacts of climate change (2004) Ecological Entomology, 29, pp. 527-542; Andrew, N.R., Hughes, L., Herbivore damage along a latitudinal gradient: relative impacts of different feeding guilds (2004) Oikos, 108, pp. 176-182; Andrew, N.R., Hughes, L., Arthropod community structure along a latitudinal gradient: implications for future impacts of climate change (2005) Austral Ecology, 30, pp. 281-297; Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Awmack, C., Bezemer, T.M., Brown, V.K., Butterfield, J., Whittaker, J.B., Herbivory in global climate change research: direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 1-16; Bale, J.S., Strathdee, A.T., Strathdee, F.C., Effects of low temperature on the Arctic aphid Acyrthosiphon brevicorne (1994) Functional Ecology, 8, pp. 621-626; Beaumont, L.J., Hughes, L., Potential changes in the distributions of latitudinally-restricted Australian butterfly species in response to climate change (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 954-971; Buse, A., Dury, S.J., Woodburn, R.J.W., Perrins, C.M., Good, J.E.G., Effects of elevated temperature on multi-species interactions: the case of pedunculate oak, winter moth and tits (1999) Functional Ecology, 13, pp. 74-82; Chao, A., Hwang, W.H., Chen, Y.C., Kuo, C.Y., Estimating the number of shared species in two communities (2000) Statistica Sinica, 10, pp. 227-246; Coddington, J.A., Young, L.H., Coyle, F.A., Estimating spider species richness in a southern Appalachian cove hardwood forest (1996) Journal of Arachnology, 24, pp. 111-128; Colwell, R.K., EstimateS: statistical estimation of species richness and shared species from samples (1997), http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/estimates, Version 6.0Colwell, R.K., Coddington, J., Estimating terrestrial biodiversity through extrapolation (1994) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B: Biological Sciences, 345, pp. 101-118; (1991) The insects of Australia, Volume I and II., , ed.
