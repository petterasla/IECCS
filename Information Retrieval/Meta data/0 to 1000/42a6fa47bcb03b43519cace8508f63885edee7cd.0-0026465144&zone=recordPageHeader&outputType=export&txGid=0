The series studied are the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit (CRU) monthly series (1854-1986) and the UK Meteorological Office (MO) quarterly series (1856-1989). A major difference is the marked seasonal variation of the warming trend in the Northern Hemisphere, with maximum in winter and minimum in summer. Analysis of the annual cycle of the CRU set suggests a shift in phase of the warm peak in the annual cycle of temperature anomalies from July to January for the period. This shift is a characteristic of the annual cycle itself and does not have to be associated with a greater warming trend in winter than in summer. -from Author",,"annual cycle; global warming; interhemispheric contrast; phase shift; temperature anomaly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08998418,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026465144
