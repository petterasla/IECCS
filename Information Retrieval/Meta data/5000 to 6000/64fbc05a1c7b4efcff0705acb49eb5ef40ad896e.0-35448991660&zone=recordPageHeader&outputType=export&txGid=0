Yet there is no precise definition of ""trend"" nor any logical algorithm for extracting it. As a result, various ad hoc extrinsic methods have been used to determine trend and to facilitate a detrending operation. In this article, a simple and logical definition of trend is given for any nonlinear and nonstationary time series as an intrinsically determined monotonic function within a certain temporal span (most often that of the data span), or a function in which there can be at most one extremum within that temporal span. Being intrinsic, the method to derive the trend has to be adaptive. This definition of trend also presumes the existence of a natural time scale. All these requirements suggest the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method as the logical choice of algorithm for extracting various trends from a data set. Once the trend is determined, the corresponding detrending operation can be implemented. With this definition of trend, the variability of the data on various time scales also can be derived naturally. Climate data are used to illustrate the determination of the intrinsic trend and natural variability. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Empirical Mode Decomposition; Global warming; Intrinsic mode function; Intrinsic trend; Trend time scale","air temperature; algorithm; analytic method; article; climate; concept analysis; detrending study; empirical mode decomposition method; global change; global surface air temperature; mathematical analysis; nonlinear system; nonstationary time series analysis; priority journal; statistical analysis; statistical significance; time series analysis; trend study",,,,,,"Flandrin, P., Gonçalvès, P., Rilling, G., (2005) Hilbert-Huang Transform: Introduction and Applications, pp. 57-74. , eds Huang NE, Shen SS-P World Scientific, Teaneck, NJ, pp; Engle, R.F., Granger, C.W.J., (1992) Long-Run Economic Relationships, , Oxford Univ Press, Oxford; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis-Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Stock, J.H., Watson, M.W., (1988) J Econ Perspect, 2, pp. 147-174; Huang, N.E., Shen, Z., Long, S.R., Wu, M.C., Shih, E.H., Zheng, Q., Tung, C.C., Liu, H.H., (1998) Proc Roy Soc London A, 454, pp. 903-995; Huang, N.E., Shen, Z., Long, S.R., (1999) Ann Rev Fluid Mech, 31, pp. 417-457; Huang, N.E., Wu, M.-L.C., Long, S.R., Shen, S.S.-P., Qu, W., Gloersen, P., Fan, K.L., (2003) Proc of Roy Soc London A, 459, pp. 2317-2345; Wu, Z., Huang, N.E., (2004) Proc Roy Soc London A, 460, pp. 1597-1611; Folland, C.K., Rayner, N.A., Brown, S.J., Smith, T.M., Shen, S.S.-P., Parker, D.E., Macadam, I., Sexton, D.M.H., (2001) Geophys Res Lett, 28, pp. 2621-2624; Jones, P.D., Osborn, T.J., Briffa, K.R., Folland, C.K., Horton, B., Alexander, L.V., Parker, D.E., Rayner, N.A., (2001) J Geophys Res, 106, pp. 3371-3380; Wu, Z., Huang, N.E., (2005) Hilbert-Huang Transform: Introduction and Applications, pp. 125-148. , eds Huang NE, Shen SS-P World Scientific, Teaneck, NJ, pp; Huang, N.E., (2006), US Patent 6,990,436 B1Flandrin, P., Rilling, G., Gonçalvès, P., (2004) IEEE Signal Process Lett, 11, pp. 112-114; Wu, Z., Huang, N.E., (2005) Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition: A Noise Assisted Data Analysis Method, , Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD, Technical Report 193; Peng, C.-K., Buldyrev, S.V., Havlin, S., Simons, M., Stanley, H.E., Goldberger, A.L., (1994) Phys Rev E, 49, pp. 1685-1689; Peng, C.-K., Havlin, S., Stanley, H.E., Goldberger, A.L., (1995) Chaos, 5, pp. 82-87","Peng, C.-K.; Division of Interdisciplinary Medicine and Biotechnology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, United States; email: zhwu@cola.iges.org",,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,,"English","Proc.
