M5S 3B3, Canada","Sugar maple decline has been a prominent issue since the late 1970s, when large areas of Quebec and Ontario were affected by this phenomenon. Links have been established between decline and insect damage, airborne heavy metals and acidic pollutants, and drought. Research has also indicated that global warming and resulting climactic changes may also cause decline. The phenomenon can be partially alleviated by proper management of sugar hushes. Although sugar maple decline has been on the wane over recent years, it may pose a serious problem in the future.","Acid rain; Economy; Global warming; Maple decline; Pollution; Prevention","atmospheric pollution; forest health; pollution effect; Canada; Acer; Acer saccharum; Insecta; Saccharum hybrid cultivar",,,,,,"Backiel, A., Acid rain and forests - An attempt to clear the air (1986) American Forests, 92, pp. 42-48; Carrier, L., (1986) Decline in Quebec's Forests - Assessment of the Situation, , Service de la Recherché Appliqué, Direction de la recherché et du development, Sainte-Foy, Quebec; Hopkin, A.A., Dumond, T., (1994) Sugar Maple Health Shows General Improvement in Ontario, , Frontline.
