Friedlingstein et al. (2006) concluded that such supplementary CO2 in the atmosphere would lead to an additional climate warming in 2100. However, as given by Friedlingstein et al. (2006), the role of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols was neglected both for their direct impact on climate and their indirect impact on the carbon cycle. Besides, the climate models used for IPCC AR4 accounted for the radiative forcing of all GHGs and anthropogenic aerosols but neglected the climate-carbon cycle feedback. In IPCC AR4, Meehl et al. (2007) attempted to reconcile these two methods in order to derive the global warming that would arise from both all anthropogenic forcings and climatecarbon cycle feedback. Here we show that the approach they used is wrong for several reasons. First, as previously done by Friedlingstein et al. (2006), they considered that the warming is proportional to the change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This assumption leads to consider that the gain in temperature is equal to the gain in CO2. However, because of the non-linearity of the climate response to increased CO2 concentrations, the gain in temperature is lower than the gain in CO 2. Second, they assumed that the temperature gains of the climate-carbon cycle feedback generated by CO2, non-CO2 GHGs and aerosols are all equal. We show here that, because of the specific spatial and temporal distribution of the radiative forcing exerted by those external perturbations, the temperature gains are all different. Based on our revised method, we found that, for the SRES A2 scenario, the projected global warming in 2100, due to increases in atmospheric CO2, non-CO 2 GHGs and anthropogenic sulphate aerosols, is 2.3-5.6°C. This is accidentally nearly equal to the original one of Meehl et al. (2007) (2.4-5.6°C).
