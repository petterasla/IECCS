The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the effects of whole ecosystem warming on bud burst and annual shoot growth of black spruce trees in northern Manitoba, Canada and (2) correlate bud burst to cumulative degree-days (CDD). The experimental design was a complete randomized block design that consisted of four replicated blocks. Each replicate block contained four treatments: soil warming only (heated outside, HO), soil and air warming (heated inside, HI), control outside (no chamber, no heating, CO), and inside a chamber maintained at ambient conditions (no soil or air warming, control inside, CI). Bud burst was measured during the first and second years of the experiment, starting in 2004, and annual shoot growth was measured for the first 3 years (2004-2006) of the study. On average, shoot bud burst occurred 11 and 9 days earlier in 2004 and 2005, respectively, for HI than for other treatments. However, mean CDD required for bud burst for HI was within the standard deviation of CO for both years. In year 1 of the treatments, shoot bud burst occurred earlier for HI than other treatments (CI, CO, HO), but final shoot length of HI trees was less than in CO trees. In the second year of warming, final shoot length was not different for HI than CO. By the third year of warming final shoot length was significantly greater for HI than all other treatments. Empirical results from this study suggest that soil and air warming causes an earlier bud burst for all years of observation and greater shoot lengths by the third season of warming. A longer growing season and greater annual shoot growth should increase carbon uptake by boreal black spruce trees in a warmer climate. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.","Black spruce; Boreal forest; Bud burst; Climate change; Global warming; Phenology; Shoot growth","boreal forest; budburst; evergreen tree; experimental design; global warming; growing season; phenology; shoot growth; Canada; Manitoba; North America; Picea mariana",,,,,,"Badeck, F.W., Bondeau, A., Böttcher, K., Doktor, D., Lucht, W., Svhaber, J., Stich, S., Responses of spring phenology to climate change (2004) New Phytologist, 162, pp. 295-309; Bergh, J., Linder, S., Effects of soil warming during spring on photosynthetic recovery in boreal Norway spruce stands (1999) Global Change Biology, 5, pp. 245-253; Bonan, G.B., Pollard, D., Thompson, S.L., Effects of boreal forest vegetation on global climate (1992) Nature, 359, pp. 716-718; Bridgham, S.D., Johnston, C.A., Pastor, J., Updegraff, K., Potential feedbacks of northern wetlands on climate change (1995) BioScience, 45, pp. 262-274; Bronson, D.R., Gower, S.T., Tanner, M., Linder, S., VanHerk, I., Response of soil surface CO2 flux in a boreal forest to ecosystem warming (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 856-867; Cao, M., Woodward, F.I., Dynamic responses of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling to global climate change (1998) Nature, 393, pp. 249-252; de Fay, E., Vacher, V., Humbert, F., Water-related phenomena in winter buds and twigs of Picea abies L.
