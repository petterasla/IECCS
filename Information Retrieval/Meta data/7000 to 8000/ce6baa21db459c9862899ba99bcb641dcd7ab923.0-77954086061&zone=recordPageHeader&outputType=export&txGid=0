Climate changes directly affect rice plant growth, and within paddy cultivation catchments, alter the hydrological regime including flood patterns and water availability for irrigation, and drainage. Although increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the future may enhance plant growth through the CO2 fertilization effect, impacts of climate change on agriculture are complicated and difficult to predict precisely. This is especially the case for assessing impacts on paddy cultivation, where basin hydrological behavior needs to be understood in detail. Possible adaptations to reduce negative impacts should be tailored to local conditions, which modify climate change impacts on paddy cultivation. In this article, climate change impacts on paddy cultivation are reviewed and a general adaptation strategy is discussed with special reference to the Japanese context. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Adaptation strategy; Adaptive management; Climate change; Global warming; Japanese context; Paddy cultivation","adaptive management; carbon dioxide; cultivation; drainage; global warming; irrigation; paddy farming; water availability; Japan",,,,,,"Iizumi, T., Hori, M.E., Yokozawa, M., Nakagawa, H., Hayashi, Y., Kimura, F., Impact of global warming on rice production in Japan based on five coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (2006) Sola, 2, pp. 156-159; Iizumi, T., Hayashi, Y., Kimura, F., Influence on rice production in Japan from cool and hot summers after global warming (2007) J Agric Meteorol, 63 (1), pp. 11-23; Sato, T., Kimura, F., Diurnal cycle of convective instability around the central mountains in Japan during the warm season (2005) J Atmos Sci, 62, pp. 1626-1636; Sato, T., Kimura, F., Kitoh, A., Projection of global warming onto regional precipitation over Mongolia using a regional climate model (2007) J Hydrol, 333 (1), pp. 144-154; Yoshikane, T., Kimura, F., Formation mechanism of the simulated SPCZ and Baiu Front using a regional climate model (2003) J Atmos Sci, 60, pp. 2612-2632; Yukimoto, S., Noda, A., Kithoh, A., Sugi, M., Kitamura, Y., Hosaka, M., Shibata, K., Uchiyama, T., A new meteorological research institute coupled GCM (MRI-CGCM2)-its climate and variability (2001) Pap Meteor Geophys, 51, pp. 47-88","Watanabe, T.; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN), 457-4 Motoyama, Kamigamo, Kita-ku, Kyoto 603-8047, Japan; email: nabe@chikyu.ac.jp",,,,,,,,16112490,,,,"English","Paddy Water Environ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954086061
