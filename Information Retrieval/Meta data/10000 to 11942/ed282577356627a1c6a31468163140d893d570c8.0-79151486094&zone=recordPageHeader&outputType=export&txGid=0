For SRF, co-combustion was compared with mass burn incineration. For organic waste, anaerobic digestion (AD) was compared with mass burn incineration. In the case of mass burn incineration, incineration with and without energy recovery was modelled. Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion was evaluated for use both as transportation fuel and for heat and power production. All relevant consequences for energy and resource consumptions, emissions to air, water and soil, upstream processes and downstream processes were included in the LCA. Energy substitutions were considered with respect to two different energy systems: a present-day Danish system based on fossil fuels and a potential future system based on 100% renewable energy. It was found that mass burn incineration of SRF with energy recovery provided savings in all impact categories, but co-combustion was better with respect to Global Warming (GW). If all heat from incineration could be utilized, however, the two alternatives were comparable for SRF. For organic waste, mass burn incineration with energy recovery was preferable over anaerobic digestion in most impact categories. Waste composition and flue gas cleaning at co-combustion plants were critical for the environmental performance of SRF treatment, while the impacts related to utilization of the digestate were significant for the outcome of organic waste treatment. The conclusions were robust in a present-day as well as in a future energy system. This indicated that mass burn incineration with efficient energy recovery is a very environmentally competitive solution overall. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Cocombustion; Digestate; Downstream process; Energy productions; Energy recovery; Energy systems; Environmental performance; Flue gas cleaning; Heat and power; Municipal Solid Waste; Optimal utilization; Organic wastes; Renewable energies; Resource consumption; Solid recovered fuels; System-based; Transportation fuels; Upstream process; Using life; Waste composition; Waste to energy; Air pollution; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Energy conversion; Environmental management; Flue gases; Fossil fuels; Gas plants; Global warming; Industrial waste treatment; Life cycle; Rating; Recovery; Renewable energy resources; Rivers; Sewage; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; biogas; fossil fuel; fuel; biogas; combustion; energy efficiency; energy use; fossil fuel; heat production; incineration; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; optimization; renewable resource; waste management; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; article; combustion; controlled study; Denmark; downstream processing; energy consumption; energy recovery; energy resource; energy yield; environmental release; flue gas; greenhouse effect; incineration; intermethod comparison; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; organic waste; power supply; priority journal; recycling; renewable energy; waste management; Anaerobiosis; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biofuels; Incineration; Metals, Heavy; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management",,"Biofuels; Metals, Heavy",,,,"Astrup, T., Pretreatment and utilization of waste incineration bottom ashes: Danish experiences (2007) Waste Management, 27, pp. 1452-1457; Astrup, T., Møller, J., Fruergaard, T., Incineration and co-combustion of waste: accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions (2009) Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 789-799; Azapagic, A., Energy from municipal solid waste: large-scale incineration or small-scale pyrolysis (2007) Journal of Environmental Engineering and Management, 6, pp. 337-346; Björklund, A., Finnveden, G., Life cycle assessment of a national policy proposal - the case of a Swedish waste incineration tax (2007) Waste Management, 27, pp. 1046-1058; Börjesson, P., Berglund, M., Environmental analysis of biogas systems - part I: fuel cycle emissions (2006) Biomass and Bioenergy, 30, pp. 469-485; Börjesson, P., Berglund, M., Environmental systems analysis of biogas systems - part II: environmental impact of replacing various reference systems (2007) Biomass and Bioenergy, 31, pp. 326-344; Bruun, S., Hansen, T., Christensen, T.H., Magid, J., Jensen, L.S., Application of processed organic municipal solid waste on agricultural land - a scenario analysis (2006) Environmental Modeling and Assessment, 11, pp. 251-265; Consonni, S., Giugliano, M., Grosso, M., Alternative strategies for energy recovery from municipal solid waste.
