Through model simulations we evaluate the cooling effects of mature riparian vegetation corridors along the streams and potential increases due to global warming for the 2020s-2080s time horizons. Site potential shade influences are smaller in the mainstream due to its relatively large size and reduced canopy density in the lower reaches, proving a modest reduction of about 0.3°C of the stream length average daily maximum temperature, compared with 1.5°C and 2.8°C in Icicle and Nason Creeks. Assuming no changes in riparian vegetation shade, stream length-average daily maximum temperature could increase in the Wenatchee River from 1-1.2°C by the 2020s to 2°C in the 2040s and 2.5-3.6°C in the 2080s, reaching 27-30°C in the warmest reaches. The cooling effects from the site potential riparian vegetation are likely to be offset by the climate change effects in the Wenatchee River by the 2020s. Buffers of mature riparian vegetation along the banks of the tributaries could prevent additional water temperature increases associated with climate change. By the end of the century, assuming site potential shade, the tributaries could have a thermal condition similar to today's condition which has less shade. In the absence of riparian vegetation restoration, at typical summer low flows, stream length average daily mean temperatures could reach about 16.4-17°C by the 2040s with stream length average daily maxima around 19.5-20.6°C, values that can impair or eliminate salmonid rearing and spawning. Modeled increases in stream temperature due to global warming are determined primarily by the projected reductions in summer streamflows, and to a lesser extent by the increases in air temperature. The findings emphasize the importance of riparian vegetation restoration along the smaller tributaries, to prevent future temperature increases and preserve aquatic habitat. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"A-thermal; Air temperature; Aquatic habitats; Canopy density; Cooling effects; Large sizes; Low flow; Maximum temperature; Mean temperature; Model simulation; Pacific Northwest; Riparian vegetation; River basins; Salmonids; Stream temperatures; Summer temperature; Temperature increase; Thermal regimes; Time horizons; Washington State; Water temperatures; Computer simulation; Global warming; Hydraulics; Restoration; Vegetation; Watersheds; Rivers; assessment method; canopy; cooling; global warming; habitat type; numerical model; population density; restoration ecology; riparian vegetation; river basin; salmonid; spawning; streamflow; temperature effect; tributary; water temperature; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); United States; Washington [United States]; Wenatchee River; Salmonidae",,,,,,"Chapra, S.C., (1997) Surface Water Quality Modeling, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Chen, D.Y., Carsel, R.F., McCutcheon, S.C., Nutter, W.L., Stream temperature simulation of forested riparian areas: I.
