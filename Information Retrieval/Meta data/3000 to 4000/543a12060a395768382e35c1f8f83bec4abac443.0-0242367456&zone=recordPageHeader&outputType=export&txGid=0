Incineration of waste gas products is not a new concept to the oil and gas industry. However in recent years, significant improvements in incinerator design and technology have resulted in optimal performance, increased reliability, and reduced capital and operating and operating costs. Since the technology has a measurable 99.99% combustion efficiency with no visible flame, black smoke, or detectable odour, petroleum companies are now considering incineration as a cost effective and environmentally responsible alternative to conventional flaring. Incineration is a proven method to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because the global warming potential (GWP) of methane is 21 times greater than the GWP of CO 2.Hence, the complete combustion process that incineration offers reduces the global warming effect and significantly improved air quality. Also assisting in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the fact that incineration requires significantly less fuel gas to combust low heat content streams, such as acid or tail gas.",,"Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Gas fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Petroleum industry; Greenhouse gases; Refuse incinerators",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00219487,,JCPMA,,"English","J Can Pet Technol",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242367456
