Vigor, exposed to natural illumination during winter. Photosynthetic capacity was compared over a range of air temperatures and photon flux densities of photosynthetically active radiation which were representative of winter climate (5-15 °C and 0-500 μmol m-2 s-1), with CO2 level during measurement similar to that during the experimental period. Long-term exposure to increased air temperature reduced leaf CO2 fixation capacity by 23% (averaged over all measurement conditions), resulting from a decline in light-saturated uptake rate, but not in incident-light quantum efficiency. CO2-stimulation was largely absent in plants grown in ambient temperature, but pronounced in plants grown under +4 °C, where it compensated for two- thirds of the 23% drop. This enhancing effect of elevated CO2 level on leaf CO2 uptake rate observed in the warmer treatment, was strongly dependent on measurement temperature, increasing from 5% at 5 °C, to up to 32% at 15 °C. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and dry matter corresponded with the observed changes in assimilation capacity, which could not be attributed to a deteriorated nitrogen status of the leaves as there was a similar N content on an area basis. Several hypotheses are considered to explain the observed CO2-temperature interactions.","Acclimation; chlorophyll fluorescence; elevated CO2 level; global warming; low temperature","Lolium perenne",,,,,,"Allen, S.G., Idso, S.B., Kimball, B.A., Anderson, M.G., Interactive effects of CO2 and environment on photosynthesis of Azolla (1988) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 42, pp. 209-217; Allen, S.G., Idso, S.B., Kimball, B.A., Baker, J.T., Allen Jr., L.H., Mauney, J.R., Radin, J.W., Anderson, M.G., (1990) Effects of Air Temperature on Atmospheric CO2-plant Growth Relationships (DOE/ER-0450T), , Springfield, Virginia: NTIS; Baker, N.R., A possible role for photosystem II in environmental perturbations of photosynthesis (1991) Physiologia Plantarum, 81, pp. 563-570; Baker, J.T., Allen Jr., L.H., Boote, K.J., Jones, P., Jones, J.W., Response of soybean to air temperature and carbon dioxide concentration (1989) Crop Science, 29, pp. 98-105; Bunce, J.A., Control of the acclimation of photosynthesis to light and temperature in relation to partitioning of photosynthate in developing soybean leaves (1991) Journal of Experimental Botany, 42, pp. 853-859; Busso, C.A., Richards, J.H., Chatterton, N.J., Non-structural carbohydrates and spring regrowth of two cool-season grasses: Interaction of drought and clipping (1990) Journal of Range Management, 43, pp. 336-343; Cornic, G., Louason, G., The effects of O2 on net photosynthesis at low temperatures (5 °C) (1980) Plant, Cell and Environment, 3, pp. 149-157; Dietz, K.-J., An evaluation of light and CO2 limitation of leaf photosynthesis by CO2 gas-exchange analysis (1986) Planta, 167, pp. 260-263; Farquhar, G.D., Von Caemmerer, G.D., Berry, J.A., A biochemical model of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in leaves of C3 species (1980) Planta, 149, pp. 78-90; Farrar, J.F., Williams, M.L., The effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature on carbon partitioning, source-sink relations and respiration (1991) Plant, Cell and Environment, 14, pp. 819-830; Genty, B., Briantais, J.-M., Baker, N.R., The relationship between the quantum yield of photosynthetic electron transport and quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (1989) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 990, pp. 87-92; Hurry, V.M., Huner, N.P.A., Low growth temperature effects a differential inhibition of photosynthesis in spring and winter wheat (1991) Plant Physiology, 96, pp. 491-497; Idso, S.B., Kimball, B.A., Anderson, M.G., Mauney, J.R., Effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on plant growth: The interactive role of air temperature (1987) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 20, pp. 1-10; Isaac, R.A., Johnson, W.C., Determination of total nitrogen in plant tissue, using a block digester (1976) Journal of the American Organization of Analytical Chemists, 59, pp. 98-100; Jordan, D.B., Ogren, W.L., The CO2/O2 specificity of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase.
