In this study, our attention was focused on evaluating the environmental impact of newly developed μ-FCs to gather data, which is essential in developing environmentally friendly products. In this regard, we first evaluated the effect of greenhouse gasses such as CO 2 exhaust during material production, cell manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal of μ-FCs on global warming and ozone layer depletion. Then, we assessed the consequent impact on human health and the ecosystem as the society cost according to the LIME method. This evaluation revealed that the society cost of μ-FCs is only 5% that of LR6 (IEC) alkaline dry batteries for a 10 kWh energy supply if the same cartridge is used 10 times.
