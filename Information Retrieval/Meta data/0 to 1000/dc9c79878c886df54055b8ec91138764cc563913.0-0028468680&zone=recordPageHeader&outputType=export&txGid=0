The findings with the speculations ranging from a nuclear winter to super-acid rain and global warming were presented in the World Climate Conference in Geneva in November 1990. Just before the war erupted in the middle of January 1991, a conference in London was called to discuss the potential risks to human life and ecological systems in case of blow out of oil fields. The scientists, using modeling techniques, raised the speculations about the global impact which, however, was discounted at a later stage. This paper presents an overview of the selected models used to assess the local, regional, and global impacts. The paper also highlights the model and data limitations and suggests future research directions to respond more effectively under emergency situations. © 1994.","Air pollution forecast; diffusion modeling; global model; Kuwaiti oil fire","Air pollution; Diffusion in gases; Environmental impact; Mathematical models; Oil fields; Public risks; Diffusion modelling; Global model; Kuwaiti oil fires; Oil well fires; acid rain; air pollution; article; climate; diffusion; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; fire; greenhouse effect; kuwait; model; oil industry; priority journal; war; Air Pollution; Dispersion Modelling; Fires; Kuwait; Oil; Overview; acid rain; diffusion modelling; global warming; nuclear winter; oil fire; review; Kuwait",,,,,,"Al-Marafie, Assessment of oil and natural gas reserve in Kuwait (1989) Energy, 14 (1), pp. 1-7; Amin, Husain, Regional environmental impact assessment - Kuwaiti oil fires (1992) Presented at the Second WMO Meeting of Experts to Assess the Response to and Atmospheric Effects of Kuwaiti Oil Fires, , Geneva, Switzerland, 25–29 May 1992; Angi, (1991) Assessment of effects on human health from Kuwait oil field fires, , Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico, The Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Air Quality data and Reports.
