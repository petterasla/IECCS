Therefore, the addition of a PSA plant was considered for the secondary CO2 recovery from the noncondensing gas to improve the efficiency. The PSA plant was operated for adsorption at the same pressure as that of the super cold separator and for desorption at the atmospheric pressure. From both the simulation and the experimental data, it was confirmed that CO2 could be concentrated from 50% in the noncondensing gas to 70% in the recovery gas by the PSA plant and the CO2 recovery efficiency of the plant was about 90%.","CO2 recovery; Gas separation; Global warming; Pressure swing adsorption; Simulation","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; flue gas; gas separation; pressure swing adsorption; adsorption; article; combustion; density; desorption; flow rate; flue gas; greenhouse effect; mathematical model; porosity; pressure",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Chihara, K., Theory and calculation of PSA (1992) Technology Collection of PSA, pp. 47-76. , T.
