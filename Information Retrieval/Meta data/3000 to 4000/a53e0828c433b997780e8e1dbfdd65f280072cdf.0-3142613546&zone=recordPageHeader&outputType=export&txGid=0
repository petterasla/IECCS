The energy consumption and thus the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming are lower than in conventional air-conditioned buildings. However, the ambient temperatures in the UK have risen over the last decade and new climatic data for use in the design of naturally ventilated buildings has been published. Using these data and dynamic thermal modelling, it is shown that passive stack ventilation alone was unlikely to maintain summertime comfort in a proposed University College London building within an urban heat island. The stack ventilation strategy was evolved by the introduction of passive downdraught cooling. This low-energy technique enables cooled air to be distributed throughout the building without mechanical assistance. The underlying principles of the technique were explored using physical models and the anticipated performance predicted using thermal modelling. The architectural integration is illustrated and the control strategy described. The resulting building is believed to be the first large-scale application of the passive downdraught cooling technique; construction began in late 2003.","Alternative technology; Climate change; Energy; Innovation; Natural ventilation; Sustainability; Thermal modelling; Urban heat island","Air conditioning; Buildings; Climate change; Cooling; Energy utilization; Mathematical models; Alternative technology; Natural ventilation; Thermal modeling; Urban heat islands; Ventilation",,,,,,"Bowman, N.T., Lomas, K.J., Cook, M.J., Eppel, H., Ford, B., Hewitt, M., Cucinella, M., Belarbi, R., Application of passive downdraught evaporative cooling (PDEC) to non-domestic buildings (1997) Renewable Energy, 10 (2-3), pp. 191-196; (1995) A Performance Specification for the Energy Efficiency Office of the Future, , General Information Report 30, Building Research Energy Conservation Support Unit/Department of the Environment, Garston, Watford; (1997) The Queens Building de Montfort University New Practice Final Report, 102. , Department of the Environment, London; (2000) Energy Use in Buildings, , Energy Consumption Guide 19, BRE, Garston, Watford; (1994) Supplementary Planning Guidance, , CBC, London; (1999) Guide A Environmental Design, pp. 1-2. , CIBSE, London; (2002) Guide J: Weather, Solar and Illuminance Data, pp. 8.1-8.6. , CIBSE, London; Cook, M.J., Lomas, K.J., Eppel, H., Design and operating concept for an innovative naturally ventilated library (1999) Proceedings of the CIBSE (1999) National Conference, pp. 500-507. , Harrogate, UK; Cook, M.J., Lomas, K.J., Eppel, H., Use of computer simulation in the design of a naturally ventilated library (1999) Proceedings of the PLEA (1999) Conference, 2, pp. 597-602. , Brisbane, Australia; (2000) The Building Act 1984; the Building Regulations (Amendment) (No 2).
