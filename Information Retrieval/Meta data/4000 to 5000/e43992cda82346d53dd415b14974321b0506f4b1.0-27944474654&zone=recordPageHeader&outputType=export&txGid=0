We used the world's smallest butterfly, the Sinai baton blue (Pseudophilotes sinaicus), as an exemplar of how global warming and human population pressures may act together to cause species extinctions. We mapped the entire global range of this butterfly and obtained extensive data on the intensity of livestock grazing. As with an increasing number of species, it is confined to a network of small habitat patches and is threatened both by indirect human-induced factors (global warming) and by the direct activities of humans (in this case, livestock grazing and collection of medicinal plants). In the absence of global warming, grazing, and plant collection, our model suggested that the butterfly will persist for at least 200 years. Above a threshold intensity of global warming, the chance of extinction accelerated rapidly, implying that there may be an annual average temperature, specific to each endangered species, above which extinction becomes very much more likely. By contrast, there was no such threshold of grazing pressure - the chance of extinction increased steadily with increasing grazing. The impact of grazing, however, decreased with higher levels of year-to-year variation in habitat quality. The effect of global warming did not depend on the future level of grazing, suggesting that the impacts of global warming and grazing are additive. If the areas of habitat patches individually fall below certain prescribed levels, the butterfly is likely to go extinct. Two patches were very important for persistence: if either were lost the species would probably go extinct. Our results have implications for the conservation management of all species whose habitats are at risk because of the direct activities of humans and in the longer term because of climate change. ©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.","Grazing; Habitat fragmentation; Incidence-function model; Lycaenidae; Metapopulation; Pseudophilotes; Sinai","butterfly; global warming; grazing; habitat fragmentation; population viability analysis; Animalia; Lycaenidae; Pseudophilotes",,,,,,"Akçakaya, H.R., Radeloff, V.C., Mladenoff, D.J., He, H.S., Integrating landscape and metapopulation modelling approaches: Viability of the Sharp-tailed Grouse in a dynamic landscape (2004) Conservation Biology, 18, pp. 526-537; Alqamy, H., Wacher, T., Rashad, S., Hemeed, M., Abd Elbasset, Y., (2003) Grazing Patterns in the High Altitude Mountain Area Around St. Katherine Town, South Sinai, Egypt: A GIS Integrated Approach, , http:www.geocities.com/stkatherinesprotectorate/Alqamy_etal_GrazingStudy. pdf, Nature Conservation Sector, Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, Cairo; Amarasekare, P., Possingham, H., Patch dynamics and metapopulation theory: The case of successional species (2001) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 209, pp. 333-344; Ball, S.J., Lindenmayer, D.B., Possingham, H.P., The predictive accuracy of population viability analysis: A test using data from two small mammal species in a fragmented landscape (2003) Biodiversity and Conservation, 12, pp. 2393-2413; Batanouny, K.H., (1999) Wild Medicinal Plants in Egypt, , Palm Press, Cairo; Beever, E.A., Brussard, P.F., Berger, J., Patterns of apparent extirpation among isolated populations of pikas (Ochotona princeps) in the Great Basin (2003) Journal of Mammalogy, 84, pp. 37-54; Bergman, K.O., Kindvall, O., Population viability analysis of the butterfly Lopinga achine in a changing landscape in Sweden (2004) Ecography, 27, pp. 49-58; Conradt, L., Bodsworth, E.J., Roper, T.J., Thomas, C.D., Non-random dispersal in the butterfly Maniola jurtina: Implications for metapopulation models (2000) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 267, pp. 1505-1510; Diamond, J.M., Biogeographic kinetics estimation of relaxation times for avifaunas of southwest Pacific islands (1972) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science-Biology, 69, pp. 3199-3203; Drechsler, M., Frank, K., Hanski, I., O'Hara, R.B., Wissel, C., Ranking metapopulation extinction risk: From patterns in data to conservation management decisions (2003) Ecological Applications, 13, pp. 990-998; Easterling, D.R., Maximum and minimum temperature trends for the globe (1997) Science, 277, pp. 364-367; Eber, S., Brandl, R., Metapopulation dynamics of the tephritid fly Urophora cardui: An evaluation of the incidence-function model assumptions with field data (1996) Journal of Animal Ecology, 65, pp. 621-630; Elmhagen, B., Angerbjörn, A., The applicability of metapopulation theory to large mammals (2001) Oikos, 94, pp. 89-100; Esler, D., Applying metapopulation theory to conservation of migratory birds (2000) Conservation Biology, 14, pp. 366-372; (2000) Conservation and Sustainable Use of Medicinal Plants in Arid and Semi-arid Ecosystems, , http:www.gefonline.org/projectDetails.cfm?projID=776, GEF, Washington, D.C; Gilpin, M.E., Hanski, I., (1991) Metapopulation Dynamics: Empirical and Theoretical Investigations, , Academic Press, London; Gonzalez, A., Lawton, J.H., Gilbert, F.S., Blackburn, J.M., Evans-Freke, I., Metapopulation dynamics, abundances, and distribution in a micro-ecosystem (1998) Science, 281, pp. 2045-2047; Grabherr, G., Gottfried, M., Pauli, H., Climate effects on mountain plants (1994) Nature, 369, p. 448; Grimm, V., Dorndorf, N., Frey-Roos, F., Wissel, C., Wyszomirski, T., Arnold, W., Modelling the role of social behaviour in the persistence of the alpine marmot Marinota marmota (2003) Oikos, 102, pp. 124-136; Hanski, I., Single-species metapopulation dynamics: Concepts, models and observations (1991) Metapopulation Dynamics, pp. 17-38. , M.E.
