During August and September 2005, bleached corals were first observed on oceanic reefs rather than coastal reefs, affecting 1 to 4% of coral colonies in the community (3 reef sites, n=736 colonies). At that time, however, no bleached corals were recorded along the eastern coast of Venezuela, an area of seasonal upwelling (3 reefs, n=181 colonies). On coastal reefs, bleaching started in October but highest levels were reached in November 2005 and January 2006, when 16% of corals were affected among a wide range of taxa (e.g. scleractinians, octocorals, Millepora and zoanthids). In the Acropora habitats of Los Roques (an oceanic reef), no bleached was recorded in 2005 (four sites, n=643 colonies). At Cayo Sombrero, a coastal reef site, bleaching was less severe in 1998 than in 2005 (9% of the coral colonies involving 2 species vs. 26% involving 23 species, respectively). Our results indicate that bleaching was more severe in 2005 than in 1998 on Venezuelan reefs; however, no mass mortality was observed in either of these two events.","Bleaching; Coral reefs; Global warming; Stress","sea water; animal; Anthozoa; article; classification; environmental monitoring; mortality; pigmentation; population dynamics; Venezuela; Animals; Anthozoa; Environmental Monitoring; Mortality; Pigmentation; Population Dynamics; Seawater; Venezuela; Acropora; Anthozoa; Millepora; Scleractinia; Zoanthidea",,,,,,"Aronson, R.B., Precht, W.F., Toscano, M.A., Koltes, K.H., The 1998 bleaching event and its aftermath on a coral reef in Belize (2002) Mar.
