Deammonification accounted for the net carbon sequestration of 0.16 g CO2/g NO2-N. Both nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO) were minor trace gases (&lt;0.1% nitrogen output). However, in comparison, the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission (1.3% nitrogen output) was significant. The global warming potential of the N2O emissions from the DEMON were similar to those found in conventional simultaneous nitrification/denitrification systems; however, CO2 emissions in the investigated system were significantly lower, thereby lessening the overall environmental effect. This was the first time such an analysis has been performed on a DEMON system.","Anaerobic ammonia oxidation; Anammox; DEMON; Mass balance; Nitritation; Offgas measurement; Sequencing batch reactor","Ammonia oxidation; ANAMMOX; Mass balance; Nitritation; Sequencing batch reactors; Ammonia; Batch reactors; Global warming; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Oxidation; Wastewater treatment; Nitrogen; carbon; nitric oxide; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous oxide; ammonia; anoxic conditions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; global warming; mass balance; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrogen oxides; quantitative analysis; air pollution; article; carbon sequestration; chemical reaction; deammonification; denitrification; environmental impact; nitrification; priority journal; Ammonia; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Pollutants; Nitric Oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Dioxide; Water Purification",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Ammonia, 7664-41-7; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Environmental Pollutants; Nitric Oxide, 10102-43-9; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrogen Dioxide, 10102-44-0",,,,"Anthonisen, A.C., Loehr, R.C., Prakasam, T.B.S., Srinath, E.G., Inhibition of Nitrification by Ammonia and Nitrous Acid (1976) J.
