One of the questions is whether the carbon balance of forests will be affected by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Regarding this question, effects of elevated [CO2] on woody-tissue respiration have frequently been neglected. Stem respiration of three Populus species (P. alba L. (Clone 2AS-11), P. nigra L. (Clone Jean Pourtet), and P. x euramericana (Clone I-214)) was measured in a managed, high-density forest plantation exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment (POPFACE). During the period of measurements, in May of the third year, stem respiration rates were not affected by the FACE treatment. Moreover, FACE did not influence the relationships between respiration rate and both stem temperature and relative growth rate. The results were supported by the reported absence of a FACE-effect on growth and stem wood density.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Forestry; Stem respiration; Ecosystems; Carbon Dioxide; Climates; Ecosystems; Forests; Stems; Populus; Populus alba; Populus euramericana; Populus nigra",,,,,,"Amthor, J.S., (1989) Respiration and Crop Productivity, , Springer-Verlag, New York, NY; Amthor, J.S., Respiration in a future, higher-CO2 world (1991) Plant Cell Environ, 14, pp. 13-20; Amthor, J.S., Terrestrial higher-plant response to increasing atmospheric [CO2] in relation to the global carbon cycle (1995) Global Change Biol, 1, pp. 243-274; Amthor, J.S., A note on the report by MB Lavigne and MG Ryan relating stem maintenance respiration rate to stem growth rate (1998) Tree Physiol, 18, p. 69; Amthor, J.S., Direct effect of elevated CO2 on nocturnal in situ leaf respiration in nine temperate deciduous tree species is small (2000) Tree Physiol, 20, pp. 139-144; Calfapietra, C., Gielen, B., Sabatti, M., De Angelis, P., Scarascia-Mugnozza, G., Ceulemans, R., Growth performance of Populus exposed to free-air carbon dioxide enrichment during the first growing season in the POPFACE experiment (2001) Ann for Sci, 58, pp. 819-828; Carey, E.V., Callaway, R.M., DeLucia, E.H., Stem respiration of ponderosa pines grown in contrasting climates: Implications for global climate change (1997) Oecologia, 111, pp. 19-25; Carey, E.V., DeLucia, E.H., Ball, J.T., Stem maintenance and construction respiration in Pinus ponderosa grown in different concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (1996) Tree Physiol, 16, pp. 125-130; Ceschia, E., (2001) Environmental Effects on Spatial and Seasonal Variations of Stem Respiration in European Beech and Norway Spruce, , Paper V.
