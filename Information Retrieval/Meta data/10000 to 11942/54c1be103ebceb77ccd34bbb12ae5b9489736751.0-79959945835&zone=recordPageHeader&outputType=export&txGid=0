To achieve that objective, the work was undertaken in accordance with ISO 14040 ""Environmental management - Life cycle assessment - Principles and framework"" which describes essential LCA characteristics and good practices. Charcoal briquettes are produced from two basic raw materials, charcoal fines and starch. The fines result from the production of charcoal from sustainably managed eucalyptus plantations. Starch is extracted from babau pulp in the Amazon region. Multi-output processes were allocated based on income from the different by-products. The results showed that more than 90% of incoming CO2 was due to biomass production for charcoal, and the remainder to starch biomass production. Based on Brazilian data, as well as information provided by the GaBi4.3 database, it turned out that supplying the energy content of 1 kg of briquettes resulted in the sequestration of 3.9690 kg of CO2, i.e. around 4 kg of CO2 per kg of briquettes produced. CO2 emissions throughout the briquette production process are totally compensated for by the environmental quality of the raw materials used. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
