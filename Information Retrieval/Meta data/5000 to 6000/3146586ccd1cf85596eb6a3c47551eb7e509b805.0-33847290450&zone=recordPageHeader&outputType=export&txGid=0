We analysed inter-annual variability in two data sets from Bautzen reservoir, Germany. In a long-term data set (1981-1999) we examined the pelagic phenology of Daphnia galeata, a keystone species, the invertebrate predator Leptodora kindtii, phytoplankton and Secchi depth in relation to water temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation index. In a short-term data set (1995-1998) we examined food web relations, particularly the consumption of D. galeata by young-of-the-year (YOY) percids and L. kindtii and rates of population change of D. galeata (abundance, recruitment pattern and non-consumptive mortality). The start of the clear-water stage (CWS) was correlated with winter temperatures. It started 5.8 days earlier per degree warming after warm winters (mean January-March temperature ≥2.5°C) compared to cold winters (mean temperature <2.5°C). However, the end of the CWS remained relatively constant. Predation by L. kindtii and YOY percids on D. galeata started distinctly earlier, i.e. by 13.0 and 6.5 days per degree warming, respectively, in years when the average May temperature was high (≥14°C) compared to years when it was low (<14°C). Significant reductions of Daphnia abundance in midsummer occurred only in years in which the mean May temperature exceeded 14°C. This temperature regime resulted in a match of over-exploitation of food resources by Daphnia during the CWS and strong predation by YOY percids and L. kindtii. Consumptive mortality increased at higher rates with a rise in temperature than net recruitment, resulting in lower Daphnia densities at the end of the CWS. Our data suggest that even low warming by 1.7°C during a short, but critical seasonal period, resulting in the coincidence of two or more factors adversely affecting a keystone species, such as Daphnia, may induce changes in whole lake food webs and thus alter entire ecosystems. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Bautzen reservoir; Clear-water stage; Leptodora; Seasonal timing; Young-of-the-year percids","fresh water; climate effect; crustacean; data set; food web; North Atlantic Oscillation; pelagic environment; phenology; phytoplankton; predator; recruitment; seasonality; water temperature; animal; article; climate; comparative study; Daphnia; food chain; Germany; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; phytoplankton; population density; population dynamics; season; temperature; Animals; Climate; Daphnia; Food Chain; Fresh Water; Germany; Greenhouse Effect; Phytoplankton; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Temperature; Bautzen Reservoir; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Saxony; Daphnia; Daphnia galeata; Invertebrata; Leptodora; Leptodora kindtii; Percidae",,,,,,"Adrian, R., Deneke, R., Mischke, U., Stellmacher, R., Lederer, P., A long-term study of the Heiligensee (1975-1992): Evidence for effects of climatic change on the dynamics of eutrophied lake ecosystems (1995) Arch Hydrobiol, 133, pp. 315-337; Beisner, B.E., McCauley, E., Wrona, F.J., The influence of temperature and food chain length on plankton predator-prey dynamics (1997) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 54, pp. 586-595; Benndorf J, Schultz H (2000) Talsperre Bautzen: Langzeit-Biomanipulation bei sehr hoher Nährstoffbelastung.
