Recent work, however, raised the possibility that dispersal among mountain ranges is an important process in the biogeography of boreal mammals in the Great Basin. We test this proposition using genetic variation in a representative species, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris). A total of 332 marmots was sampled from 10 ranges and genotyped at six microsatellite loci. If the intervening desert lowlands are impermeable barriers to dispersal, then there should be no relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance among mountaintop populations, and genetic diversity should be diminished because gene flow would not be available to replace alleles lost over thousands of generations of isolation. Our results did not support these predictions. There was a strong correlation between genetic and geographic distance, demonstrating an isolation-by-distance pattern, and genetic diversity was high. Our results suggest that marmot populations in the Great Basin may be linked by dispersal, providing a mechanism to replenish genetic variation lost by drift. However, global climate change over the next several decades could make the desert lowlands more difficult to traverse, eventually transforming the boreal faunas of Great Basin mountaintops into the isolated relicts they were originally portrayed to be. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Biogeography; Boreal; Dispersal; Gene flow; Great Basin USA; Habitat islands; Marmota flaviventris; Microsatellites","biogeography; genetics; mammal; relict species; Basin and Range Province; Great Basin; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Mammalia; Marmota; Marmota flaviventris; Sciuridae",,,,,,"Armitage, K.B., Social and population dynamics of yellow-bellied marmots: Results from long-term research (1991) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 22, pp. 379-407; Belfiore, N.M., May, B., Variable microsatellite loci in red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, and their characterization in other crayfish taxa (2000) Molecular Ecology, 9, pp. 2231-2234; Britten, H.B., Brussard, P.F., Murphy, D.D., Ehrlich, P.R., A test of isolation-by-distance in central Rocky Mountain and Great Basin populations of Edith's checkerspot butterfly (Euphyryas editha) (1995) Journal of Heredity, 86, pp. 204-210; Brown, J.H., Mammals on mountaintops: Nonequilibrium insular biogeography (1971) American Naturalist, 105, pp. 467-478; Brown, J.H., Kodric-Brown, A., Turnover rates in insular biogeography: Effect of immigration on extinction (1977) Ecology, 58, pp. 445-449; Carmichael, L.E., Nagy, J.A., Larter, N.C., Strobeck, C., Prey specialization may influence patterns of gene flow in wolves of the Canadian Northwest (2001) Molecular Ecology, 10, pp. 2787-2798; Cornelius, C., Cofré, H., Marquet, P.A., Effects of habitat fragmentation on bird species in a relict temperate forest in semiarid Chile (2000) Conservation Biology, 14, pp. 534-543; Cornuet, J.M., Piry, S., Luikart, G., Estoup, A., Solignac, M., New methods employing multilocus genotypes to select or exclude populations as origins of individuals (1999) Genetics, 153, pp. 1989-2000. , http://www.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/softwares/; Eldridge, M.D.B., King, J.M., Loupis, A.K., Spencer, P.B.S., Taylor, A.C., Pope, L.C., Hall, G.P., Unprecedented low levels of genetic variation and inbreeding depression in an island population of the black-footed rock-wallaby (1999) Conservation Biology, 13, pp. 531-541; El Mousadik, A., Petit, R.J., High level of genetic differentiation for allelic richness among populations of the argan tree [Argania spinosa (L.)
