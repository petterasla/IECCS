TD3200 serves as a major baseline dataset for detecting global climate change. It is of paramount importance to the climate community that these data be as error-free as possible. Many of these errors are systematic in nature. If a deterministic approach is taken, using empirically developed criteria, many if not most of these errors can be corrected or removed. A computer program utilizing Backus Normal Form structure design and a series of chain-linked tests in the form of encoded rules has been developed as a means of modelling the human subjective process of inductive data review. -from Authors",,"cooperative observer network; data validation; database; error; precipitation; temperature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027066347
