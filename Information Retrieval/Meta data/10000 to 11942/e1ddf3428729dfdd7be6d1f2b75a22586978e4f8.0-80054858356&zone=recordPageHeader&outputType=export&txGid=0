While historical transitions between major energy sources have occurred, most of these shifts lasted over a century or longer and were stimulated by resource scarcity, high labor costs, and technological innovations. The energy transition of the 21st century will need to be more rapid. Unfortunately, little is known about how to accelerate energy transitions. This article reviews past transitions and factors behind them, along with their time frames. Three modern case studies are discussed: Brazil, which shifted from an oil-based transportation system to one based on sugarcane-ethanol (success); France, which shifted from oil-fired electric power to nuclear power (success); and the United States, which attempted to shift from foreign oil to a mix of domestic energy resources (failure). Lessons from these attempts to govern energy transitions are discussed. Several policy instruments to accelerate a transition are identified, though even under ideal circumstances a global energy supply transition will be very slow. Given the need to simultaneously implement programs in countries with different political economies, a greater focus on energy efficiency, promotion of Smart Grids, and possibly a new treaty should yield more timely results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Energy transition; Smart Grid","Electric power; Energy source; Energy transitions; Global climate changes; Global energy; Historical transition; Labor costs; Petroleum supply; Policy instruments; Political economy; Resource scarcity; Smart grid; Sustainable energy; Sustainable energy systems; Technological innovation; Time frame; Transportation system; Climate change; Cost accounting; Employment; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy resources; Ethanol; Nuclear energy; Petroleum transportation; Wages; Smart power grids; alternative energy; biofuel; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy resource; governance approach; innovation; nuclear power; policy analysis; policy approach; political economy; strategic approach; sustainable development; Brazil; France; United States",,,,,,"Allcott, H., Mullainathan, S., Behavior and energy policy (2010) Science, 327 (5970), pp. 1204-1205; Allen, R.C., (2009) The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Ayres, R.U., Ayres, E.H., A bridge to the renewable energy future (2009) World Watch, 22 (5), pp. 22-29; Ayres, R.U., Ayres, E.H., (2010) Crossing the Energy Divide: Moving from Fossil Fuel Dependence to a Clean-Energy Future, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Balat, M., Balat, H., Recent trends in global production and utilization of bio-ethanol fuel (2009) Applied Energy, 86 (11), pp. 2273-2282; Bashmakov, I., Three laws of energy transitions (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (7), pp. 3583-3594; Brown, M.A., Chandler, S., Governing confusion: how statutes, fiscal policy, and regulations impede clean energy technologies (2008) Stanford Law and Policy Review, 19 (3), pp. 472-509; Casten, T.R., Schewe, P.F., Getting the most from energy: recycling waste heat can keep carbon from going sky high (2009) American Scientist, 97 (1), pp. 26-33; Chu, S., Carbon capture and sequestration (2009) Science, 325 (5948), p. 1599; Churella, A., (1998) From Steam to Diesel, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Cochrane, J.L., Carter energy policy and the ninety-fifth congress (1981) Energy Policy in Perspective: Today's Problems, Yesterday's Solutions, pp. 547-600. , The Brookings Institution, Washington, DC, C.D.
