Its soils are dominated by permafrost and are rich in organic carbon. Its climate is unique due to the influence of the Asian monsoon and its complex topography. To date, the carbon dynamics of the Tibetan Plateau have not been well quantified under changes of climate and permafrost conditions. Here we use a process-based biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), which was incorporated with a soil thermal model, to examine the permafrost dynamics and their effects on carbon dynamics on the plateau during the past century. Location The Tibetan Plateau. Methods: We parameterize and verify the TEM using the existing data for soil temperature, permafrost distribution and carbon and nitrogen from the region.We then extrapolate the model and parameters to the whole plateau. Results: During the 20th century, the Tibetan Plateau changed from a small carbon source or neutral in the early part of the century to a sink later, with a large inter-annual and spatial variability due to changes of climate and permafrost conditions. Net primary production and soil respiration increased by 0.52 and 0.22 Tg C year-1, respectively, resulting in a regional carbon sink increase of 0.3 Tg C year-1. By the end of the century, the regional carbon sink reached 36 Tg C year-1 and carbon storage in vegetation and soils is 32 and 16 Pg C, respectively.On the plateau, from west to east, the net primary production, soil respiration and net ecosystem production increased, due primarily to the increase of air temperature and precipitation and lowering elevation. In contrast, the decrease of carbon fluxes from south to north was primarily controlled by precipitation gradient. Dynamics of air temperature and associated soil temperature and active layer depth resulted in a higher plant carbon uptake than soil carbon release, strengthening the regional carbon sink during the century. Main conclusions: We found that increasing soil temperature and deepening active layer depth enhanced soil respiration, increasing the net nitrogen mineralization rate. Together with the effects of warming air temperature and rising CO2 concentrations on photosynthesis, the stronger plant nitrogen uptake due to the enhanced available nitrogen stimulates plant carbon uptake, thereby strengthening the regional carbon sink as the rate of increase net primary production was faster than that of soil respiration. Further, the warming and associated soil thermal dynamics shifted the regional carbon sink from the middle of July in the early 20th century to early July by the end of the century. Our study suggests that soil thermal dynamics should be considered for future quantification of carbon dynamics in this climate-sensitive region. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon dynamics; Carbon sink; Net ecosystem production; Net primary production; Permafrost; Soil thermal model; Terrestrial ecosystem model; Tibetan plateau","annual variation; biogeochemistry; carbon sink; climate change; ecosystem modeling; net ecosystem production; net primary production; parameterization; permafrost; soil carbon; soil respiration; soil temperature; spatial variation; terrestrial ecosystem; twentieth century; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Embryophyta",,,,,,"Balshi, M.S., McGuire, A.D., Zhuang, Q., Melillo, J.M., Kicklighter, D.W., Kasischke, E., Wirth, C., Shvidenko, A., The role of historical fire disturbance in the carbon dynamics of the pan-boreal region: a processbased analysis (2007) Journal of Geophysical Research, 112, pp. G02029; Belward, A.S., Estes, J.E., Kline, K.D., The IGBP-DIS global 1-km land-cover data set DISCover: a project overview (1999) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 65, p. 1013; Brown, J., Ferrians Jr., O.J., Heginbottom, J.A., Melnikov, E.S., (1998) Circum-Arctic map of permafrost and ground-ice conditions, , revised February 2001.
