In this paper, we estimated the forest vegetation carbon storage from the Fourth Forest Inventory Data (FFID) in China using a modified volume-derived method. Results showed that total carbon storage and mean carbon density of forest vegetation in China were 3.8 Pg C (about 1.1% of the global vegetation carbon stock) and 41.32 Mg/ha, respectively. In addition, based on linear multiple regression equation and factor analysis method, we analyzed contributions of biotic and abiotic factors (including mean forest age, mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, and altitude) to forest carbon storage. Our results indicated that forest vegetation carbon storage was more sensitive to changes of mean annual temperature than other factors, suggesting that global warming would seriously affect the forest carbon storage. © Springer 2006.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Forestry; Fuel storage; Carbon storage; Climatic factors; Forest vegetation; Fourth Forest Inventory Data (FFID); Vegetation; carbon sequestration; climate effect; environmental factor; forest ecosystem; global warming; regression; Carbon; Climates; Forestry; Plants; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,,,,,"Birdsey, R.A., Plantinga, A.J., Heath, L.S., Past and prospective carbon storage in United States forests (1993) For.
