The study finds that total (agricultural and nonagricultural) income in rural counties and municipios in the US and Brazil are affected by climate. The study demonstrates that this income effect is due to changes in the net value of agriculture. Regions with better climates for agriculture support higher rural incomes and regions with poor climates have more rural poverty. The results also suggest that global warming will likely increase rural poverty. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",,"Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Finance; Rural areas; Climate change impact; Counties; Per capita rural income; Rural poverty; Global warming; agricultural price; climate effect; global warming; income; poverty; rural economy; Agriculture; Climates; Finance; Brazil; North America; South America; United States",,,,,,"Basist, A., Peterson, N., Peterson, T., Williams, C., Using the special sensor microwave imager to monitor land surface temperature, wetness, and snow cover (1998) J.
