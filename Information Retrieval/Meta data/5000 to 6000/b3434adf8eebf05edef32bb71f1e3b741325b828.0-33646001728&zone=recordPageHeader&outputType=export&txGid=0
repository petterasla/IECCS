These quantities are analyzed for current climate conditions based on results from the NCEP/ NCAR reanalyses and a simulation with the CCCma coupled climate model. Potential changes with climate change are considered based on two quasi-equilibrium climate change integrations for which the forcing has been stabilized at years 2050 and 2100 values of the IS92a forcing scenario. The surface energy fluxes, which contribute to the variance of SST, are similar in the modelled and reanalyzed atmosphere but modelled temperature variance is conditioned on the thickness of the upper ocean model layer. Changes of SST variance with global warming show broad scale patterns with decreases in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and the northern extra-tropical Pacific, and increases in both the sub-tropical Pacific and mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic. The changes in SST variance are not associated only with changes in the variances of surface energy fluxes/transports but also with changes in the covariances among them and by changes in the temperature autocorrelation structure. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"energy budget; energy flux; global warming; heat transfer; sea surface temperature; surface energy",,,,,,"AchutaRao, K., Sperber, K., Simulation of the El Niño southern oscillation: Results from the coupled model intercomparison project (2002) Clim Dyn, 19, pp. 191-209. , CMIP Modelling groups; Alexander, M.A., Scott, J.D., Deser, C., Processes that influence sea surface temperature and ocean mixed layer depth variability in a coupled model (2000) J Geophys Res - Oceans, 105, pp. 16823-16842; Barnett, T.P., Interaction of the Monsoon and Pacific Trade Wind System at Interannual Time Scales Part I: The Equatorial Zone (1983) Monsoon Weather Rev, 111, pp. 756-773; Bates, G.T., Meehl, G.A., The Effect of CO2 Concentration on the frequency of blocking in a general circulation model coupled to a simple mixed layer ocean model (1986) Monsoon Weather Rev, 114, pp. 687-701; Battisti, D.S., Dynamics and thermodynamics of a warming event in a coupled tropical atmosphere-ocean model (1988) J Atmos Sci, 45, pp. 2889-2919; Battisti, D.S., Hirst, A., Interannual variability in the tropical atmosphere/ocean system: Influence of the basic state, ocean geometry and non-linearity (1989) J Atmos Sci, 46, pp. 1687-1712; Boer, G.J., Yu, B., Climate sensitivity and response (2003) Clim Dyn, 20, pp. 415-429; Boer, G.J., Flato, G., Reader, M.C., Ramsden, D., A transient climate change simulation with greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing: Experimental design and comparison with the instrumental record for the 20th century (2000) Clim Dyn, 16, pp. 405-425; Boer, G.J., Flato, G., Ramsden, D., A transient climate change simulation with greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing: Projected climate for the 21st century (2000) Clim Dyn, 16, pp. 427-450; Boer, G.J., Yu, B., Kim, S.J., Flato, G., Is there observationa support for an ElNiño-like pattern of future global warming?
