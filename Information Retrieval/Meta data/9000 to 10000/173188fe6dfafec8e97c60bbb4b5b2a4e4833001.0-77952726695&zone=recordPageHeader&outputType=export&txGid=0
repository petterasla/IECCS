Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports use radiative forcing to compare different climate change mechanisms. The Kyoto Protocol has adopted the 100-yr global warming potential (GWP) to compare the climate impact from emissions for various greenhouse gases. The IPCC Special Report on Aviation proposed a radiative forcing index (RFI) to compare aviation effects and presented GWPs for aviation effects to counter the misuse of the RFI as an emission metric by policy makers and carbon-offsetting sites. It is required to continue the use, evaluation, and development of the GWP and GTP metrics, continue the development of global climate model, adapt common metrics, and continue development of socioeconomic metrics.",,"Aircraft design; Climate impacts; Global climate model; Global warming potential; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; KYOTO protocol; Policy makers; Radiative forcings; Socio-economic metrics; Aviation; Emission control; Environmental impact; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Radio interference; Special effects; Climate models",,,,,,"Burkhardt, U., Kärcher, B., Schumann, U., Global modeling of the contrail cirrus climate impact (2010) Bull.
