We recently conducted several studies on the possible impact of global warming on the protein families of influenza A virus. More studies are needed in order to have a full picture of the impact of global warming on living organisms, especially its effect on viruses. In this study, we correlate trends in global warming with evolution of the nucleoprotein from influenza A virus and then analyse the trends with respect to northern/southern hemispheres, virus subtypes and sampling species. The results suggest that global warming may have an impact on the evolution of the nucleoprotein from influenza A virus. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Evolution; Global warming; Influenza; Mutation; Nucleoprotein","nucleoprotein; virus RNA; article; evolution; genetics; greenhouse effect; Influenza virus A; temperature; time; Biological Evolution; Global Warming; Influenza A virus; Nucleoproteins; RNA, Viral; Temperature; Time Factors; Influenza A virus; Influenzavirus A",,"Nucleoproteins; RNA, Viral",,,,"Aimone, F., The 1918 influenza epidemic in New York City: a review of the public health response (2010) Public Health Rep., 125 (SUPPL. 3), pp. 71-79; Brown, I.H., Summary of avian influenza activity in Europe, Asia, and Africa, 2006-2009 (2010) Avian Dis., 54 (1 SUPPL), pp. 187-193; Cai, Y.D., Zhou, G.P., Chou, K.C., Support vector machines for predicting membrane protein types by using functional domain composition (2003) Biophys.
