Therefore, the tendency toward using variable-speed drives (VSDs) to save energy by adjusting motor speed is seen, but on account of increasing motor loss in nonrated conditions, an efficiency control system can improve energy saving even more. In this paper, after carrying out a detailed motor efficiency analysis, an appropriate method for motor efficiency maximization control, combined with a VSD, is presented and implemented. Experimental results of the implemented system validate the proposed method. © 2009 IEEE.","Efficiency optimization; Energy saving; Motor drives; Single-phase induction motors (SPIMs); Speed control","Efficiency controls; Efficiency optimization; Efficiency optimization controls; Energy saving; Loss minimizations; Motor drives; Motor efficiencies; Motor speed; Oil prices; Save energies; Single-phase induction motor drives; Single-phase induction motors (SPIMs); Variable-speed drives; Drives; Electric drives; Electric losses; Electric machinery; Electric motors; Global warming; Optimization; Speed; Speed control; Speed regulators; Induction motors",,,,,,"Day, A.L., Energy saver control for single phase motors, (1984), U.S. Patent 4 455 521, Jun. 19Sundareswaran, K., An improved energy-saving scheme for capacitor-run induction motor (2001) IEEE Trans.
