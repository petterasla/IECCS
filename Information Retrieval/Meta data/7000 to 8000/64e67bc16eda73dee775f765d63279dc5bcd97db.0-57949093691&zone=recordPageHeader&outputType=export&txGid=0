Due to the price hike of the fossil fuel and the concern of the global warming, the development of wind power has rapidly progressed over the last decade. The annual growth rate has exceeded 26% since 1990s. Many countries have set goal for high penetration levels of wind generations. Recently, several large-scale wind generation projects have been implemented all over the world. It is economically beneficial to integrate very large amounts of wind capacity in power systems. Unlike other traditional generation facilities, using wind turbines present technical challenges in producing continuous and controllable electric power. The distinct feature of the wind energy is its nature of "" intermittent"". Since it is difficult to predict and control the output of the wind generation, its potential impacts on the electric grid are different from the traditional energy sources. At high penetration level, an extra fast response reserve capacity is needed to cover shortfall of generation when a sudden deficit of wind takes place. To enable a proper management of the uncertainty, this study presents an approach to make wind power become a more reliable source on both energy and capacity by using energy storage devices. Combining the wind power generation system with energy storage will reduce fluctuation of wind power. Since it requires capital investment for the storage system, it is important to estimate reasonable storage capacities for desired applications. In addition, energy storage application for reducing the output variation during the gust wind is also studied. © 2008 IEEE.","Energy storage equipment; Fluctuation; Storage capacity; Wind gust; Wind power; Wind turbine","Applications; Data storage equipment; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Engines; Flywheels; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Global warming; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Investments; Mesh generation; Military operations; Renewable energy resources; Turbines; Wind turbines; All over the worlds; Annual growth rates; Capital investments; Distinct features; Electric grids; Electric powers; Energy sources; Energy storage applications; Energy Storage devices; Fast responses; Fluctuation; Generation resources; Penetration levels; Potential impacts; Power systems; Price hikes; Reserve capacities; Storage capacity; Storage systems; Technical challenges; Wind capacities; Wind energies; Wind generations; Wind gust; Wind power generation systems; Wind turbine technologies; Wind power",,,,,,"Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy web site ""Wind energy topic"", , http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/index.html; (2006) Analysis of Transmission Alternatives for Competitive Renewable Energy Zones in Texas, , ERCOT Report, December; Wind resource of Taiwan Map from Renewable Energy in Taiwan, , http://re.org.tw/com/f1/f1w1.aspx; Tatan wind speed data between Feb 1, 2006 and May 31, 2007, , Taiwan Power Company; Methaprayoon, K., Yingvivatanapong, C., Lee, W.J., Liao, J., An Integration of ANN Wind Power Estimation into UC Considering the Forecasting Uncertainty; Taipower Company 2006-2007 study planning No.006-2821-02, The system study of the Taipower system with the rapid increased wind power generation capacity, Middle report in 2007,3GE Wind 1.5 MW and 3.6MW Wind Turbine Generators, PSS/E Dynamic Models Documentation PTI., Issue 3.0, June 10, 2004Nicholas W.Miller, William W.Price, Juan J.Sanchea-Gasca, Dynamic Modeling of GE 1.5MW and 3.6MW Wind Turbine-Generators, October 27, 2003, Version 3.0PSS/E Power Operation Manual and Program Application Guide, PTI., August 2004Soo Kook, K., McKenzie, K.J., Liu, Y., Atcitty, S., A study on applications of energy storage for the wind power operation in power systems; (2005) Global Wind 2005 Report, , Global Wind Energy Council GWEC, August; Large scale integration of wind energy in the European power supply: Analysis, , http://www.ewea.org, EWEA, December, 2005; Design and Operation of Power Systems with Large Amounts of Wind Power (1821) Global Wind Power Conference, p. 2006. , First results of IEA collaboration, September, Adelaide, Australia; Lu, M.-S., Chang, C.-L., Lee, W.-J., Impact of Wind Generation on a Transmission System (2007), 39th NAPS","Lu, M.-S.; System Planning Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei 10016, Taiwan; email: u066199@taipower.com.tw",,,,"2008 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, IAS'08","5 October 2008 through 9 October 2008","Edmonton, AB",74531,01972618,9781424422791,CIASD,,"English","Conf Rec IAS Annu Meet",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-57949093691
