Efforts to limit or even reverse global warming must be derived from the knowledge of the Earth's complex life-support system. In this context, the balance between liquid and gaseous water plays a crucial role, and water management becomes an important field of innovation and action, globally, on the scale of watersheds but also on the very local level. Cascading use, reuse, and temporary storage of water in urban settings must be considered to limit over-extraction of water from natural resources, and to maintain the life supporting function of ecosystems. At the same time, public health requirements, cost efficiency, and reliability demands are to be met. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2009.","Ecosystem; Management tools; Self-regulation; Urbanization; Water reuse; Water-climate relationship",,,,,,,"(2008) Climate Change 2007-Fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports, , Cambridge University Press; Pearce, F., (2006) When the Rivers Run Dry: What Happens When Our Water Runs Out?, , Eden Project London; Solomon, S., Assessment of the physical science of climate change (2007) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group i, , http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu, PowerPoint presentation, London; Protagoras (2004) Protagoras and Meno, , Plato.
