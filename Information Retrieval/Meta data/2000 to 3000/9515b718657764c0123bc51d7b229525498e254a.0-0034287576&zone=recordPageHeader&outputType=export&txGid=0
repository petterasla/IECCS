To this aim, we propose a sequestration system of CO2 in the deep ocean. The system is an inverse-J pipeline set in the ocean at a depth of 200-3000 m. In the system, a pumping effect by buoyancy of the dissolving CO2 bubbles is used to transport CO2-rich seawater to great depths. In the present paper, we discuss characteristics and performance of our proposal on the basis of experimental and numerical investigation. In a laboratory-scale experiment(pipe diameter of 25 mm and pipe height of 7.69 m), we observed over 98% dissolution of injected CO2 gas into tap water. The liquid phase flow caused by gas-lift effect was strong enough to transport the CO2-rich water including nondissolved tiny bubbles into the deep ocean. Then a numerical stimulation based on the experimentally derived models was applied to a system considering 10 MW class power plants. The results showed that our proposal is hopeful for an efficient method of CO2 disposal into the deep ocean.To mitigate global warming, a system dissolving huge amounts of CO2 gas captured from fossil fuel fired power plants into the ocean with high acceptance by the ocean environment is indispensable.
