In spite of the HC refrigerants' highly flammable characteristics, they are used in many applications, with attention being paid to the safety of the leakage from the system, as other refrigerants in recent years are not related with any effect on the depletion of the ozone layer and increase in global warming. Theoretical results showed that all of the alternative refrigerants investigated in the analysis have a slightly lower performance coefficient (COP) than CFC12, CFC22, and HFC134a for the condensation temperature of 50 °C and evaporating temperatures ranging between -30 °C and 10 °C. Refrigerant blends of HC290/HC600a (40/60 by wt.%) instead of CFC12 and HC290/HC1270 (20/80 by wt.%) instead of CFC22 are found to be replacement refrigerants among other alternatives in this paper as a result of the analysis. The effects of the main parameters of performance analysis such as refrigerant type, degree of subcooling, and superheating on the refrigerating effect, coefficient of performance and volumetric refrigeration capacity are also investigated for various evaporating temperatures. © 2010.","Alternative refrigerants; Butane; Hydrocarbon mixture; Isobutane; Propane; R12; R134a; R22; R32; Refrigeration","Alternative refrigerant; Hydrocarbon mixture; Isobutanes; R12; R134a; R22; R32; Butane; Global warming; Hydrocarbons; Mixtures; Ozone; Ozone layer; Propane; Refrigerating machinery; Refrigeration; Refrigerators; Refrigerants",,,,,,"Wongwises, S., Kamboon, A., Orachon, B., Experimental investigation of hydrocarbon mixtures to replace HFC-134a in an automotive air conditioning system (2006) Energy Conversion and Management, 47, pp. 1644-1659; Wongwises, S., Chimres, N., Experimental study of hydrocarbon mixtures to replace HFC-134a in a domestic refrigerator (2005) Energy Conversion and Management, 46, pp. 85-100; Hammad, M.A., Alsaad, M.A., The use of hydrocarbon mixtures as refrigerants in domestic refrigerators (1999) Applied Thermal Engineering, 19, pp. 1181-1189; Jung, D., Kim, C.B., Lim, B.H., Lee, H.W., Testing of a hydrocarbon mixture in domestic refrigerators (1996) ASHRAE Transactions, 3, pp. 1077-1084; Granryd, E., Hydrocarbons-an overview (2001) International Journal of Refrigeration, 24, pp. 15-24; Han, X.H., Wang, Q., Zhu, Z.W., Chen, G.M., Cycle performance study on R-32/R-125/R-161 as alternative refrigerant to R-407C (2007) Applied Thermal Engineering, 27, pp. 2559-2565; Park, K.J., Seo, T., Jung, D., Performance of alternative refrigerants for residential air-conditioning applications (2007) Applied Energy, 84, pp. 985-991; Mani, K., Selladurai, V., Experimental analysis of a new refrigerant mixture as drop-in replacement for CFC12 and HFC134a (2008) International Journal of Thermal Sciences, 47, pp. 1490-1495; Chen, J., Yu, J., Performance of new refrigerant cycle using refrigerant mixture R32/R134a for residential air-conditioner applications (2008) Energy and Buildings, 40, pp. 2022-2027; Stoecker, W.F., Jones, J.W., Refrigeration and Air Conditioning (1982) second ed.,, pp. 298-299. , McGraw-Hill","Dalkilic, A.S.; Heat and Thermodynamics Division, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Yildiz, Besiktas, Istanbul, 34349, Turkey; email: dalkilic@yildiz.edu.tr",,,,,,,,07351933,,IHMTD,,"English","Int.
