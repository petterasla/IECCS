Although each of these themes has seen considerable attention in the modeling and forecasting communities, their joint effects remain little explored and poorly understood. We developed ecological niche models for 1804 species from the European flora, which we projected globally to identify areas of potential distribution, both at present and across 4 scenarios of future (2055) climates. As expected from previous studies, projections based on the CGCM1 climate model were more extreme than those based on the HadCM3 model, and projections based on the a2 emissions scenario were more extreme than those based on the b2 emissions scenario. However, less expected were the highly nonlinear and contrasting projected changes in distributional areas among continents: increases in distributional potential in Europe often corresponded with decreases on other continents, and species seeing expanding potential on one continent often saw contracting potential on others. In conclusion, global climate change will have complex effects on invasive potential of plant species. The shifts and changes identified in this study suggest strongly that biological communities will see dramatic reorganizations in coming decades owing to shifting invasive potential by nonnative species. © 2008 Peterson et al.",,"article; climate change; controlled study; ecological niche; Europe; flora; geographic distribution; global climate; native species; nonhuman; plant community; species invasion; climate; ecology; plant physiology; theoretical model; Climate; Ecology; Europe; Models, Theoretical; Plant Physiology",,,,,,"Chapin, F.S.I., Zavaleta, E.S., Eviner, V.T., Naylor, R.L., Vitousek, P.M., Consequences of changing biodiversity (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 234-242; Novacek, M.J., Cleland, E.E., The current biodiversity extinction event: Scenarios for mitigation and recovery (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 98, pp. 5466-5470; Walther, G.-R., Post, E., Convey, P., Menzel, A., Parmesan, C., Ecological responses to recent climate change (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 389-395; Parmesan, C., Yohe, G., A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 37-42; Carlton, J.T., Pattern, process, and prediction in marine invasion ecology (1996) Biological Conservation, 78, pp. 97-106; Lawton, J.H., Brown, K.C., The population and community ecology of invading insects (1986) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B, 314, pp. 607-617; (2002) Predicting Invasions of Nonindigenous Plants and Plant Pests, , NAS , Washington, D.C, National Academy of Sciences; Williamson, M., (1996) Biological Invasions, , London: Chapman & Hall; Soberón, J., Peterson, A.T., Biodiversity informatics: Managing and applying primary biodiversity data (2004) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B, 359, pp. 689-698; Dukes, J.S., Mooney, H.A., Does global change increase the success of biological invaders (1999) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 14, pp. 135-139; Roura-Pascual, N., Suarez, A., Gómez, C., Pons, P., Touyama, Y., Geographic potential of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile Mayr) in the face of global climate change (2005) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 271, pp. 2527-2535; Soberón, J., Peterson, A.T., Interpretation of models or fundamental ecological niches and species' distributional areas (2005) Biodiversity Informatics, 2, pp. 1-10; Pearson, R.G., Dawson, T.P., Predicting the impacts of climate change on the distribution of species: Are bioclimate envelope models useful?
