Insofar as GWPs are used to guide investment and socioeconomic choices, there is merit in adopting cost-benefit techniques. The parametric equivalence of the two definitions applied for the ordinary atmospheric forcing; but for its rate-of change, only the discounting definition gives realistic results, as shown in application to methane, a short-lived greenhouse gas. -Authors",,"climate change; global warming potential; greenhouse gas; methane; warming; Atmospheric composition; Climatology; Economic and social effects; Methane; Climate change; Global warming potentials (GWPs); Greenhouse gases; Greenhouse effect",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028184139
