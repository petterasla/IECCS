The extent and volume of the largest outlet glacier from the Quelccaya Ice Cap (14°S, 71°W, 5200 m above sea level) have been measured four times between 1963 and 1991, once by aerial and three times by terrestrial photogrammetry. Drastic and accelerating rates of retreat of the terminus and of ice volume loss have been documented. The rate of retreat was nearly three times as fast between 1983 and 1991 as between 1963 and 1978 and the rate of volume loss was over seven times as great. These results are consistent with the warming in this region and with the behavior of tropical glaciers in the Cordillera Blanca in Peru and in the Ruwenzori Mountains and on Mount Kenya in East Africa. -Authors",,"glacier; measurement; Quelccaya Ice Cape; retreat rate; terrestrial photogrammetry; Peru, Andes, Qori Kalis Glacier; Arctic engineering; Environmental engineering; Glaciers; Photomapping; Surveys; Glacier retreat; Global changes; Global warming; Terrestrial photographs; Photogrammetry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027788473
