Data were analysed using an energy-based model. Survival was not affected. In ad libitum conditions, growth rate increased linearly with temperature as a consequence of quicker food ingestion. Our model parameterised using the data in ad libitum conditions could account for the data obtained in food limited conditions. Reproduction was not influenced by temperature because the decrease of the duration of the period of energetic investment into reproduction compensated for the increase of the feeding rate when temperature increased. Based on these results, we then built a model describing life cycles in the field which may contribute to the field assessment of the consequences of global warming or pollution. © Springer 2005.","Chironomus riparius; Energy; Feeding level; Life cycle; Modelling; Temperature","Global warming; Growth kinetics; Life cycle; Mathematical models; Nutrition; Temperature; Thermal effects; Chironomus riparius; Energy; Feeding level; Modeling; Marine biology; ecological modeling; emergence; feeding; growth; life cycle; survival; temperature; Chironomidae; Chironomus riparius; Chironomus thummi",,,,,,"Armitage, P.D., Cranston, P.S., Pinder, L.C.V., (1995) The Chironomidae. the Biology and Ecology of Non-biting Midges, , Chapman and Hall London; Benider, A., Tifnouti, A., Pourriot, R., Growth of Moina macrocopa (Straus 1820) (Crustacea, Cladocera): Influence of trophic conditions, population density and temperature (2002) Hydrobiologia, 468, pp. 1-11; Berg, M.B., Hellenthal, R.A., The role of Chironomidae in energy flow of a lotic system (1992) Netherlands Journal of Aquatic Ecology, 26, pp. 471-476; Bervoets, L., Blust, R., Verheyen, R., Effect of temperature on cadmium and zinc uptake by the midge larvae Chironomus riparius (1996) Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 31, pp. 502-511; Congdon, J.D., Dunham, A.E., Hopkins, W.A., Rowe, C.L., Hinton, T.G., Resource allocation-based life histories: A conceptual basis for studies of ecological toxicology (2001) Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 20, pp. 1698-1703; Frouz, J., Ali, A., Lobinske, R.J., Influence of temperature on developmental rate, wing length, and larval head capsule size of pestiferous midge Chironomus crassicaudatus (Diptera: Chironomidae) (2002) Journal of Economic Entomology, 95, pp. 699-705; Goddeeris, B.R., Vermeulen, A.C., De Geest, E., Jacobs, H., Baert, B., Ollevier, F., Diapause induction in the third and fourth instar of Chironomus riparius (Diptera) from Belgian lowland brooks (2001) Archiv für Hydrobiologie, 150, pp. 307-327; Gong, Z.J., Xie, P., Li, Y.L., Effect of temperature and photoperiod on hatching of eggs of Tokunagayusurika akamusi (Tokunaga) (Diptera: Chironomidae) (2002) Journal of Freshwater Ecology, 17, pp. 169-170; Hall, C.J., Burns, C.W., Mortality and growth responses of Daphnia carinata to increases in temperature and salinity (2002) Freshwater Biology, 47, pp. 451-458; Hauer, F.R., Benke, A.C., Rapid growth of snag-dwelling chironomids in a blackwater river - The influence of temperature and discharge (1991) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 10, pp. 154-164; Jeyasingham, K., Ling, N., Acute toxicity of arsenic to three species of New Zealand chironomids: Chironomus zealandicus, Chironomus sp. a and Polypedilum pavidus (Diptera, Chironomidae) (2000) Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 64, pp. 708-715; Kooijman, S.A.L.M., (2000) Dynamic Energy and Mass Budgets in Biological Systems, , Cambridge University press Cambridge, United-Kingdom; Lydy, M.J., Belden, J.B., Ternes, M.A., Effects of temperature on the toxicity of M-parathion, chlorpyrifos, and pentachlorobenzene to Chironomus tentans (1999) Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 37, pp. 542-547; Nava, D.E., Parra, J.R.P., Biology of Cerotoma arcuatus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and field validation of a laboratory model for temperature requirements (2003) Journal of Economic Entomology, 96, pp. 609-614; Newbold, J.D., Sweeney, B.W., Vannote, R.L., A model for seasonal synchrony in stream mayflies (1994) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 13, pp. 3-18; Péry, A.R.R., Mons, R., Flammarion, P., Lagadic, L., Garric, J., A modelling approach to link food availability, growth, emergence, and reproduction for the midge Chironomus riparius (2002) Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 21, pp. 2507-2513; Péry, A.R.R., Sulmon, V., Mons, R., Flammarion, P., Lagadic, L., Garric, J., A model to understand the confounding effects of natural sediments to toxicity tests with Chironomus riparius (2003) Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 22, pp. 2476-2481; Sankarperumal, G., Pandian, T.J., Effect of temperature and Chlorella density on growth and metamorphosis of Chironomus circumdatus (Kieffer) (Diptera) (1991) Aquatic Insects, 13, pp. 167-177","Péry, A.R.R.; Unité Biologie des Ecosystèmes Aquatiques, 3b quai Chauveau, 69009, Lyon, France; email: alexandre.pery@cemagref.fr",,,,,,,,00188158,,HYDRB,,"English","Hydrobiologia",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-28444435919
