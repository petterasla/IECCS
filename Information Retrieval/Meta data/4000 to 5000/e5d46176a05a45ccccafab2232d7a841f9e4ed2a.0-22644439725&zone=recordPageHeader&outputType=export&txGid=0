Considering the entire life cycle of each monitor, water eutrophication and aquatic ecotoxicity impacts for the baseline analysis were greater for the LCD while all other impact categories (e.g., resource use, energy, ozone depletion, landfill space use, human health toxicity) were greater for the CRT. Energy inputs from CRT glass manufacturing, for which there was some uncertainty in the data, drive many of the CRT impacts. Modifying the glass energy data based on comparison to secondary data resulted in nine of the 20 impact categories having greater relative life-cycle impacts for the LCD than the CRT. When comparing the manufacturing stages of each monitor type in the baseline scenario, the LCD has greater relative burdens on the environment in eight categories. Energy, global warming, and human health toxicity impacts are also presented in greater detail, showing contributions from each life-cycle stage. This study's results can allow industry to focus on frit manufacturing, PWB manufacturingimprovements can be made. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cathode ray tube (CRT); Computer displays; Design for the environment; Life-cycle assessment; Life-cycle impact assessment; Liquid crystal display (LCD)","Cathode ray tubes; Computer monitors; Data reduction; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Global warming; Liquid crystal displays; Toxicity; Computer displays; Design for the environment; Life-cycle assessment; Life-cycle impact assessment; Life cycle",,,,,,"Environmental Protection Agency, U.S., (1998) Computer Display Industry and Technology Profile; Socolof, M.L., Overly, J.G., Kincaid, L.E., Geibig, J.R., (2001) Desktop Computer Displays: A Life-cycle Assessment.
