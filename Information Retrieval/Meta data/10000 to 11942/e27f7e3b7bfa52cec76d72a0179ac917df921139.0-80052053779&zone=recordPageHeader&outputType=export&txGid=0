New indices have appeared, and, to calculate them, information is required on the quantitative characteristics of the climate system's components-current and expected-within standard periods of 20, 100, and 500 years. The calculations of some of these indices and potentials require consideration for variations in the rate of energy exchange between the atmosphere and the underlying surface (ocean) within the indicated periods. This leads to a more general problem of analyzing the sensitivity of the climate system to external (radiative) forcing and its response to such a forcing for the conditions of both stationary (equilibrium) and nonstationary ""greenhouse"" climates. A brief review of the few existing studies of such a response is given. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","anthropogenic forcing; climate changes; climate system; global warming; potential; radiative forcing","aerosol; air temperature; anthropogenic effect; climate change; global warming; greenhouse gas; radiative forcing",,,,,,"Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, J.J., (1990) Climate Change.
