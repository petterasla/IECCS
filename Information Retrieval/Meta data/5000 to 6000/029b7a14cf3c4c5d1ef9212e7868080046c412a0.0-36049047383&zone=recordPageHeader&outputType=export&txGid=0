Using 10 meteorological stations over the YR basin in 1961-2005, the spatial and temporal characteristics of temperature and precipitation as well as potential evapotranspiration are analyzed. The results are as follows. (1) The annual and four seasonal mean air temperature shows statistically significant increasing trend, the tendency is more significant in winter and fall. The warming in Lhasa river basin is most significant. (2) The precipitation is decreasing from the 1960s to the 1980s and increasing since the 1980s. From 1961 to 2005, the annual and four seasonal mean precipitation is increasing but not statistically significant, especially in fall and spring. The increasing precipitation rates are more pronounced in Niyangqu and Palong Zangbo river basins, the closer to the upper YR is, the less precipitation increasing rate would be. (3) The annual and four seasonal mean potential evapotranspiration has decreased, especially after the 1980s, and most of it happens in winter and spring. The decreasing trend is most significant in the middle YR and Nianchu river basin. (4) Compared with the Mt. Qomolangma region, Tibetan Plateau, China and global average, the magnitudes of warming trend over the YR basin since the 1970s exceed those areas in the same period, and compared with the Tibetan Plateau, the magnitudes of precipitation increasing and potential evapotranspiration decreasing are larger, suggesting that the YR basin is one of the most sensitive areas to global warming. © 2007 Science in China Press.","Climate change; Sensitivity; Yarlung Zangbo river basin",,,,,,,"Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water requirements (1998) FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56, , FAO; Barry, R.G., (1992) Mountain Weather and Climate, , Methuen London; Bian, D., Du, J., Climate variation feature and its effect on environment change in Central Tibet from 1961-2000 (2006) Journal of Applied Meteorological Science, 17, pp. 169-175. , 2; Chen, B., Chao, W.C., Liu, X., Enhanced climatic warming in the Tibetan Plateau due to doubling CO 2: A model study (2003) Climate Dynamics, 20, pp. 401-413. , 4; Chen, S., Liu, Y., Axel, T., Climatic change on the Tibetan Plateau: Potential evapotran-spiration trends from 1961-2000 (2006) Climatic Change, 76, pp. 291-319; Dong, Y., Li, S., Dong, G., Tentative study on the statua and the causes of desertification in Yarlung Zangbo river basin (1999) Scientia Geographica Sinica, 19, pp. 35-41. , 1; Du, J., Change of temperature in Tibetan Plateau from 1961 to 2000 (2001) Acta Geographica Sinica, 56, pp. 682-690. , 6; Duan, A., Wu, G., Zhang, Q., New proofs of the recent climate warming over the Tibetan Plateau as a result of the increasing greenhouse gases emissions (2006) Chinese Science Bulletin, 51, pp. 1396-1400. , 11; Du, J., Hu, J., Chen, H., Trend of surface humid index in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River over Tibet in recent 40 years (2006) Journal of Natural Resources, 21, pp. 196-203. , 2; Du, J., Ma, Y., Climatic trend of rainfall over Tibetan Plateau from 1971 to 2000 (2004) Acta Geographica Sinica, 59, pp. 375-382. , 3; Gao, G., Chen, D., Ren, G., Spatial and temporal variations and controlling factors of potential evapotranspiration in China: 1956-2000 (2006) Journal of Geographical Sciences, 16, pp. 3-12. , 1; Jin, H., Dong, G., Li, S., Study on the cause developing trend and control measures of land desertification in the lower middle reaches of Yarlung Zangbo River (1997) Journal of Desert Research, 17, pp. 255-260. , 3; Kothawale, D.R., Kumar, K.R., On the recent changes in surface temperature trends over India (2005) Geophysical Research Letters, 32, p. 18714; Li, C., Kang, S., Review of the studies on climate change since the last inter-glacial period on the Tibetan Plateau (2006) Journal of Geographical Sciences, 61, pp. 327-335. , 3; Liu, T., Hydrological characteristics of Yalungzangbo River (1999) Acta Geographica Sinica, 54, pp. 157-164. , suppl; Liu, X., Chen, B., Climatic warming in the Tibetan Plateau during recent decades (2000) International Journal of Climatology, 20, pp. 1729-1742. , 14; Ma, X., Li, D., Analyses on air temperature and its abrupt change over Qinghai-Xiang Plateau in modern age (2003) Plateau Meteorology, 22, pp. 507-512. , 5; Niu, T., Liu, H., Song, Y., Study on decade change of climate shift from warm-dry period to warm-wet period over Tibetan Plateau (2005) Journal of Applied Meteorological Science, 16, pp. 763-771. , 6; Tang, Q., Xiong, Y., (1998) River Hydrology in China, , Science Press Beijing; (1984) Rivers and Lakes of Xizang, , The Comprehensive Scientific Exploration Team to the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau.
