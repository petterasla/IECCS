A well-to-wheel analysis has been conducted for cassava-based ethanol (CE) in Thailand. The aim of the analysis is to assess the potentials of CE in the form of gasohol E10 for promoting energy security and reducing environmental impacts in comparison with conventional gasoline (CG). Method. In the LCA procedure, three separate but interrelated components: inventory analysis, characterization and interpretation were performed for the complete chain of the fuel life cycle. To compare gasohol E10 and CG, this study addressed their impact potentials per gasoline-equivalent litre, taking into account the performance difference between gasohol and gasoline in an explosion motor. Results and Discussions. The results obtained show that CE in the form of E10, along its whole life cycle, reduces certain environmental loads compared to CG. The percentage reductions relative to CG are 6.1% for fossil energy use, 6.0% for global warming potential, 6.8% for acidification, and 12.2% for nutrient enrichment. Using biomass in place of fossil fuels for process energy in the manufacture of ethanol leads to improved overall life cycle energy and environmental performance of ethanol blends relative to CG. Conclusions and Outlook. The LCA brings to light the key areas in the ethanol production cycle that researchers and technicians need to work on to maximize ethanol's contribution to energy security and environmental sustainability © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Cassava ethanol (CE); Energy; Environmental performance; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Thailand","alcohol; fossil fuel; fuel; gasoline; acidification; article; biomass; cassava; environmental impact; fossil energy; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; Thailand; Manihot esculenta",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; gasoline, 86290-81-5",,,,"Wang, M., Saricks, C., Santini, D., (1999) Effects of Fuel Ethanol Use on Fuel-Cycle Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, , Center for Transportation Research, Argonne National Laboratory Argonne, Illinois; Levelton, Assessment of Net Emissions of Greenhouse Gases from Ethanol-Gasoline Blends in Southern Ontario, , R-2000-1: Cross-Sectoral Policy Development Division; Shapouri, H., Duffield, J.A., McAloon, A., Wang, M., (2004) The 2001 Net Energy Balance of Corn Ethanol, , US Department of Agriculture; Fu, G.Z., Chan, A.W., Minns, D.E., Life Cycle Assessment of Bio-ethanol Derived from Cellulose (2003) Int J LCA, 8, pp. 137-141. , 3; Ronjnaridpiched, C., Kosintarasaenee, S., Sriroth, K., Piyachomkwan, K., Tia, S., Kaewsompong, S., Nitivararat, M., (2003) Development of Ethanol Production Technology from Cassava Chip at a Pilot Plant Scale, , National Research Council of Thailand; Sriroth, K., Piyachomkwan, K., Veerathaworn, P., Sarobol, V., Vichukit, V., Ronjnaridpiched, C., Bioethanol from cassava (2003) Proceedings of the 2nd Regional Conference on Energy Technology Towards a Clean Environment, , Phuket, Thailand, 12-14 February 2003; Sukphisal, B., Market development of biofuels in Thailand (2005) Thai Parliament - Biomass - Asia Workshop, , The renewable energy committee, December 15, 2005; Nguyen, T.L.T., Gheewala, S.H., Garivait, S., Full Chain Energy Analysis of Fuel Ethanol from Cassava in Thailand (2007) Environ Sci Technol, 14, pp. 4135-4142. , 11; (2004) Agricultural Statistics of Thailand.
