In the present study, dairy cattle slurry (liquid manure) was subjected first to pre-treatment by separation using a screw press to obtain a liquid (LF) and a solid fraction (SF). Then, the different fractions and the whole slurry (WS) were combined with two nitrification inhibitors (NI), dicyandiamide (DCD) or 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), were applied to soil to assess the effect of slurry treatment by separation and NI addition on soil N dynamics and CH4, CO2, NH3, NO and N2O emissions. The WS and the two slurry fractions, combined or not with DCD or DMPP, were applied to soil at an equivalent field dosage of 120 kg total N ha-1. Controls including a soil only, soil-DCD and soil-DMPP treatments were also included. The mixtures were incubated for 93-d at 20 °C. Results obtained show that NI inhibited nitrification between 16 and 30-d in WS and LF, with DMPP having a longer effect over time compared to DCD. There was no significant effect of NI on nitrification for the SF treatment. Nitrification inhibitors did not significantly affect (P &gt; 0.05) the CH4, CO2 and N2O emissions, but significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) NO emissions. Furthermore, the two NIs had a similar effect on gaseous emissions. Throughout the entire experiment, the greatest amount of NO was released from the LF treatment (without NI), while the greatest amount of N2O was released from the SF treatment. Slurry separation had no impact on N emissions, while the combination of this process with one of the two NI led to a small reduction in total N emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","DCD; DMPP; Gaseous emissions; N dynamics; Nitrification inhibitor; Slurry treatment","Animal manure; Cattle slurry; Dairy cattles; DCD; Dicyandiamide; Dimethylpyrazole phosphates; Gaseous emissions; Laboratory studies; Liquid manure; Ni additions; Nitrification inhibitor; NO emissions; Pre-Treatment; Screw press; Slurry treatment; Small reduction; Solid fraction; Dairies; Denitrification; Dynamics; Global warming; Liquids; Manures; Nitrification; Oxidation; Slurry pipelines; Soils; Soil pollution; 3,4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate; ammonia; carbon; carbon dioxide; diamide; dicyanodiamide; methane; nitric oxide; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; pyrazole derivative; unclassified drug; agricultural emission; cattle; inhibitor; manure; nitrification; nutrient dynamics; separation; slurry; soil chemistry; soil nitrogen; waste treatment; addition reaction; agricultural slurry; article; controlled study; dairy cattle; incubation temperature; manure; nitrification; waste management; Animals; Cattle; Gases; Guanidines; Nitrogen; Pyrazoles; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Animalia; Bos",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; diamide, 10465-78-8; methane, 74-82-8; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate; Gases; Guanidines; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Pyrazoles; Soil; Soil Pollutants; dicyandiamido, 461-58-5",,,,"Burton, C.H., Turner, C., (2003) Manure Management Treatment Strategies for Sustainable Agriculture. second ed., , Silsoe Research Institute, Silsoe, UK; Calderón, F.J., McCarty, G.W., Reeves III, J.B., Analysis of manure and soil nitrogen mineralization during incubation (2005) Biol.
