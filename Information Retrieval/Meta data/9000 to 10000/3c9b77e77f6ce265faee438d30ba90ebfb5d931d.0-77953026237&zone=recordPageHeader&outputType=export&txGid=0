In addition, it avoids the conversion of land use for crop production. This is a strong advantage for Singapore which has relatively smaller land space than other countries. The import of virgin oil as feedstock into Singapore is also avoided. Therefore, the more appropriate feedstock to produce biodiesel in Singapore context is WCO. According to the National Environment Agency, diesel vehicles in Singapore contribute 50% of the total particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM0.25) emissions to air ambient. Hence, the aim of this life cycle assessment study was to compare the environmental performances of biodiesel derived from WCO and low sulphur diesel in terms of global warming potential, life cycle energy efficiency (LCEE) and fossil energy ratio (FER) using the life cycle inventory. The results of this study would serve as a reference for energy policy makers and environmental agencies. Materials and methods: ISO14040 and ISO14044 (ISO14040 2006; ISO 14044 2006) are used as the method for implementing this study. This comparative study between biodiesel derived from WCO and low sulphur diesel is done by comparing the life cycle inventory results. The tailpipe emission tests were done using a gas analyser. Results: Biodiesel production data are collected from a local facility. The production of main ingredients, types of transportation, conversion of WCO to biodiesel and the usage of biodiesel were considered within the dataset. Production of low sulphur diesel was modelled according to several references. The phases include foreign crude oil production, refining, transporting of diesel to station and finally the usage of diesel. The testing vehicle for both transportation fuels is an ISUZU pickup truck with engine capacity of 3,059 cc and in direct injection combustion chamber type. The functional unit in this study is output of 1 transportation-km. Discussion: In this section, two types of emissions are discussed. First is the net life cycle emission. The second is the exhaust tailpipe emissions. Highest amount of reduction on a life cycle basis is PM2.5 and PM10 with a significant reduction of 99.99%. On the exhaust tailpipe emission basis, the reduction for total particulate matter is 94.80%. The LCEE of biodiesel produced from WCO is calculated as 86.93%. This is higher than biodiesel reported from US studies (using soybean as feedstock) which is 80.55%. The low LCEE value of 71.09% for low sulphur diesel could be attributed by the fact that Singapore depends greatly on foreign crude oil production and imports. The FER is calculated to be 9.39. The life cycle of biodiesel produced from the recycling of WCO produces more than nine times as much energy in its final fuel product as it uses in fossil energy. This is three times higher than biodiesel derived from soya oil in the USA. Conclusions: The emission results and the life cycle energy efficiencies have indicated that the replacement of low sulphur diesel with biodiesel derived from WCO as a transportation fuel is favourable. Recommendations and perspectives: In Singapore, the potential substitution percentage of diesel by biodiesel if all of the WCO can be collected and processed to biodiesel is 1.42%. There is a need for recyclers to convince the food establishments and users of cooking oil of the benefits of recycling cooking oil, which in turn obtains a steady source of WCO as feedstock for biodiesel production. In addition, as the biodiesel life cycle defined is very much dependent on WCO as a feedstock, it is recommended to optimise the WCO collection network. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Biodiesel; LCA; LCM; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle management; Recycling; Singapore; Waste cooking oil","biodiesel; diesel fuel; fossil fuel; oil; petroleum; soybean oil; article; biofuel production; controlled study; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; particulate matter; petrochemical industry; priority journal; recycling; Singapore; United States; Glycine max",,"diesel fuel, 68334-30-5; petroleum, 8002-05-9; soybean oil, 8001-22-7",,,,"(2007) Annual Report, , http://www.ava.gov.sg/Publications/ListOfPublications/, AVA Prepared by Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore; (2006) Official Energy Statistics from the US Government, , http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Singapore/Oil.html, EIA Prepared by Energy Information Agency; (2006) Electricity/Heat in Singapore in 2006, , http://www.iea.org/Textbase/stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=SG\, IEA Prepared by International Energy Agency; (2006) Well-to-wheels Analysis of Future Automotive Fuels and Powertrains in the European Context, , http://ies.jrc.cec.eu.int/WTW, IES Prepared by European Commission Institute for Environment and Sustainability; (2006) Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing, , http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf, IPCC Prepared by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; (2006) Environmental Management-Life Cycle Assessment-Principles and Framework, , ISO 14040; (2006) Environmental Management-Life Cycle Assessment-Requirements & Guidelines, , ISO 14044; Jafar, A.H., Al-Amin, A.Q., Siwar, C., Environmental impact of alternative fuel mix in electricity generation in Malaysia (2008) Renew Energy, 33, pp. 2229-2235. , 10.1016/j.renene.2007.12.014; Kannan, R., Leong, K.C., Osman, R., Ho, H.K., Gas-fired combined cycle plant in Singapore: Energy use, GWP and cost-a life cycle approach (2004) Energy Convers Manag, 46, pp. 13-14; Kannan, R., Leong, K.C., Osman, R., Ho, H.K., Life cycle energy, emissions cost inventory of power generation technologies in Singapore (2004) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 11, pp. 702-715. , 10.1016/j.rser.2005.05.004; Kannan, R., Tso, C.P., Osman, R., Ho, H.K., LCA-LCCA of oil fired steam turbine power plant in Singapore (2004) Energy Convers Manag, 45, pp. 18-19. , 10.1016/j.enconman.2004.01.005; (2002) GM Well-to-wheel Analysis of Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Advanced Fuel/vehicle Systems-a European Study, , http://www.lbst.de/gm-wtw, L-B-Systemtechnik GmbH; Lee, K.-M., Lee, S.-Y., Hur, T., Life cycle inventory analysis for electricity in Korea (2004) Energy, 29 (1), pp. 87-101. , DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2003.08.007; Leung, D.Y.C., Development of a clean biodiesel fuel in Hong Kong using recycled oil (2001) Water Air Soil Pollut, 130, pp. 277-282. , 10.1023/A:1013883823851; (2007) Malaysia Energy Centre, Study on Grid Connected Electricity Baselines in Malaysia, , http://cdm.eib.org.my/subindex.php?menu=24&article=1044, MEC; (2006) Singapore Green Plan 2012, , http://www.mewr.gov.sg/SGP2012/, MEWR Prepared by Ministry of the Environmental and Water Resources; (2009) Clean Development Mechanism Information on Emission Factors, , http://www.nccc.gov.sg/cdm/cdm.shtm, NCCC Prepared by National Climate Change Committee; (2005) State of the Environment 2005 Report, , http://www.nea.gov.sg/cms/ccird/soe/soe_chap1.pdf, NEA Prepared by National Environmental Agency; (2008) National Environmental Agency Water Pollution, , http://app2.nea.gov.sg/topics_waterpollution.aspx, NEA Water Pollution; (2009) Frequently Asked Questions on the Haze National Environment Agency, , http://app2.nea.gov.sg/psi_faqairquality.aspx, NEA; (1998), NREL National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Energy, life cycle inventory of biodiesel and petroleum diesel for use in an urban bus, MayPascual, L.M., Tan, R.R., (2004) Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Coconut Biodiesel and Conventional Diesel for Philippine Automotive Transportation and Industrial Boiler Application, , http://www.lcacenter.org/InLCA2004/papers/Pascual_L_paper.pdf, InLCA/LCM; Pleanjai, S., Gheewala, S.H., Garivait, S., Greenhouse gas emissions from production and use of used cooking oil methyl ester as transport fuel in Thailand (2009) J Clean Prod, 17, pp. 873-876. , 10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.01.007 10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.01.007 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXovFOitbw%3D; (2009) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), , http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html, USEPA Prepared by Environmental Protection Agency","Chua, C.
