Long-term annual average rainfall, coefficient of variation of annual rainfall, precipitation concentration and aridity indices at each station have been computed and then interpolated using kriging method within a geographic information system to show the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall. Mann-Kendall test has been used to analyze the trend in rainfall data in different recording stations and the Sen's slope method has been used to determine the magnitude of change. A moderate variation in in-ter-annual rainfall and high variation in intra-annual rainfall in Bangladesh have been observed. Non-significant positive trend of annual, monsoon and pre-monsoon rainfall, and a negative trend in winter rainfall are found in Bangladesh. Spatial distribution of rainfall trends shows that rainfall is increasing in the coastal zone and northern Bangladesh, and decreasing in the central part of the country. A declining trend of precipitation concentration is also observed in most of the stations. These results may be a first indication of the precipitation response to global warming - a hypothesis which needs to be further investigated by means of climate model projections.","Aridity; Climate change; GIS; Precipitation concentration index; Rainfall trend analysis",,,,,,,"Ahmed, A.S.M.S., Munim, A.A., Begum, Q.N., Chowdhury, A.M., El-Niño southern oscillation and the rainfall variation over Bangladesh (1996) Mausam, 47, pp. 157-162; Ahmed, A.S.M.S., Munim, A.A., Begum, Q.N., Chowdhury, A.M., Probabilistic estimates of rainfall extremes in Bangladesh during the pre-monsoon season (1989) Indian Geogr.
