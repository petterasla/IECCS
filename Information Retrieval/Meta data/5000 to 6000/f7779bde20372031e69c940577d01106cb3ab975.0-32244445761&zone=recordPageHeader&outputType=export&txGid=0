The numerical results indicated that their temperature fields have distinct difference; the permafrost tables under the adjustable ventilated-duct embankments are raised and the thaw bulbs are degenerated gradually; they are able to ensure the thermal stability of the permafrost under the scenario of climatic warming but the ordinary embankment is not. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
