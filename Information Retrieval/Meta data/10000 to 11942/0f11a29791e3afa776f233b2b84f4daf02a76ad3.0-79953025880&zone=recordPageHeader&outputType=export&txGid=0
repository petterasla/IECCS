Using an environmental history approach we assess the extent of change in plant cover at 32 sites using repeat photographs that cover a time span of 36-113 years. The results indicate that in the majority of sites there has been a significant increase in cover of riparian vegetation in both the channel beds and adjacent floodplain environments. The most important species to have increased in cover across the region is Acacia karroo. We interpret the findings in the context of historical changes in climate and land use practices. Damage to riparian vegetation caused by mega-herbivores probably ceased sometime during the early 19th century as did scouring events related to large floods that occurred at regular intervals from the 15th to early 20th centuries. Extensive cutting of riparian vegetation for charcoal and firewood has also declined over the last 150 years. Changes in the grazing history as well as increased abstraction and dam building along perennial rivers in the region also account for some of the changes observed in riparian vegetation during the second half of the 20th century. Predictions of climate change related to global warming anticipate increased drought events with the subsequent loss of species and habitats in the study area. The evidence presented here suggests that an awareness of the region's historical ecology should be considered more carefully in the modelling and formulation of future climate change predictions as well as in the understanding of climate change impacts over time frames of decades and centuries. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","climate change; environmental history; hydrology; repeat photography; water flow","agriculture; animal; article; climate; domestic animal; ecology; history; human; plant; river; South Africa; wild animal; Agriculture; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Animals, Wild; Climate; Ecology; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Plants; Rivers; South Africa; Acacia; Acacia karroo",,,,,,"Acocks, J.P.H., Riverine vegetation of the semi-arid and arid regions of South Africa (1976) Journal of the South African Biological Society, 17, pp. 21-35; Acocks, J.P.H., The flora that matched the fauna (1979) Bothalia, 12, pp. 673-709; Allsopp, N., Gaika, L., Knight, R., Monakisi, C., Hoffman, M.T., The Impact of Heavy Grazing on an Ephemeral River System in the Succulent Karoo, South (2007) Journal of Arid Environments, 71, pp. 82-96; Auble, G.T., Friedman, J.M., Scott, M.L., Relating riparian vegetation to present and future streamflows (1994) Ecological Applications, 4, pp. 544-554; Beauchamp, V.B., Stromberg, J.C., Changes to herbaceous plant communities on a regulated desert river (2008) River Research and Applications, 24, pp. 754-770; Bendix, J., Hupp, C.R., Hydrological and geomorphological impacts on riparian plant communities (2000) Hydrological Processes, 14, pp. 2977-2990; Bonora, D.V., (2009) An Environmental History of the Cedarberg: Changing Climate, Land Use and Vegetation Patterns, p. 161. , Unpublished MSc thesis University of Cape Town, Cape Town; Brookes, C.J., Hooke, J.M., Mant, J., Modelling vegetation interactions with channel flow in river valleys of the Mediterranean region (2000) Catena, 40, pp. 93-119; Carter, W., Woodland expansions in the Platte River, Nebraska: Patterns and causes (1994) Ecological Monographs, 64, pp. 45-84; Chase, B., Meadows, M., Late Quarternary dynamics of southern Africa's winter-rainfall zone (2007) Earth Science Reviews, 84, pp. 103-138; Christensen, J.H., Hewitson, B., Busuioc, A., Chen, A., Gao, X., Held, I., Jones, R., Whetton, P., Regional Climate Projections (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , S.
