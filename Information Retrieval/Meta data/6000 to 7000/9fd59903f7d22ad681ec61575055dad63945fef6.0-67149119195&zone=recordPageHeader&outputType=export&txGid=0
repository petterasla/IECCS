As a consequence, the history of climate is reflected in the deviation of the 18O/16O of air (δ18Oatm) from seawater δ18O (known as the Dole effect). We report variations in δ18O atm over the past 60,000 years related to Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger events, two modes of abrupt climate change observed during the last ice age. Correlations with cave records support the hypothesis that the Dole effect is primarily governed by the strength of the Asian and North African monsoons and confirm that widespread changes in low-latitude terrestrial rainfall accompanied abrupt climate change. The rapid δ 18Oatm changes can also be used to synchronize ice records by providing global time markers.",,"oxygen 18; rain; oxygen; sea water; biosphere; climate change; Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle; dating method; geochronology; Heinrich event; oxygen isotope; paleoclimate; photosynthesis; Pleistocene; rainfall; respiration; seawater; secretion; article; atmosphere; biosphere; climate change; environmental impact; ice age; oxygen concentration; priority journal; weather; wind; Antarctica; atmosphere; chemistry; climate; ecosystem; ice cover; photosynthesis; time; Antarctic Regions; Atmosphere; Climatic Processes; Ecosystem; Ice Cover; Oxygen; Oxygen Isotopes; Photosynthesis; Rain; Seawater; Time",,"oxygen 18, 14797-71-8; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen Isotopes",,,,"Denton, G.H., Alley, R.B., Comer, G.C., Broecker, W.S., (2005) Quat.

The amplitude of the former in the tropics is larger than that of the D/O stadials, in contrast to high-latitude records, where all stadials seem to have a similar expression. It has been proposed (39) that the Heinrich stadials represent times when the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation was completely shut off, and the D/O stadials represent times when only the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) seas and the associated overflows on the Greenland-Scotland ridge were shut off, with the Labrador Sea continuing to produce deep water. The implication of this hypothesis is that the northward cross-equatorial flow in the Atlantic ceased during Heinrich stadials but not during the D/O stadials. This could explainWaelbroeck, C., (2002) Quat. Sci. Rev, 21, p. 295; Hendricks, M., Bender, M.L., Barnett, B., (2004) Deep Sea Res. Part I Oceanogr. Res.

Cycles, 17, p. 1089. , 10.1029/2003GB002056; The idea that the fraction of land versus ocean photosynthesis influences the Dole effect is awkward in its construction; it implicitly assumes that there is a single land value of fractionation, whereas in fact it is now clear that the land fractionation is extremely heterogeneous in time and space. It may be conceptually more helpful to think of the Dole effect as being the integral of competing heavy land isofluxes (e.g, from savannas, deserts, and well-aerated soils) and light land isofluxes e.g, from humid, water-saturated bio-mes, against a background of relatively uniform and constant oceanic values, Here, the concept of isofluxes subsumes the isotopic effects of both sources and sinksDenton, G.H., Broecker, W.S., Alley, R.B., (2006) PAGES News, 14, p. 1416; The view that Heinrich stadials are times of sea-level rise is supported by speleothem records (32) that show a consistent pattern of weak monsoons during times of sea-level rise at many glacial terminations, suggesting that there is some unifying mechanism that produces Heinrich-like stadials and weak monsoons in the presence of sea level rise. For example, such a mechanism could be the effect of meltwater injected into the North Atlantic ocean on the meridional ocean overturning circulation and winter sea ice cover in the North Atlantic (1)A composite Dongge Cave record was constructed from the entire 8.8-ky record of Wang et al. (4) and the Dongge D4 record (5) from 8.8 to 15.7 ka, and was linearly interpolated and smoothed with a 200-year running average (Fig. 3). This average was resampled at 20-year intervals for comparison with ΔεLAND, giving a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.95 for the 0.3- to 12-ka interval (Fig. 4). The correlation between ΔεLAND and Hulu Cave records is visually apparent but numerically limited by time scale errors (GISP2 time scale is up to 1 ky too young in the 16- to 31-ka interval)Chappellaz, J., (1993) Nature, 366, p. 443; Wang, Y.J., (2008) Nature, 451, p. 1090; J.

Lett, 35, pp. L07704. , 10.1029/2008GL033292; The amount of photosynthesis occurring in boreal regions is known to increase during the warm phases of D/O events from pollen records, The amount of respiration must also increase at these times, because respiration and photosynthesis are tightly coupled by the fact that organic matter is generally unstable with respect to microbial attack. Thus, the respiratory contribution to the Dole effect will increase because the boreal respiratory fractionation factor is greater than the mean global value. The same logic holds in reverse for wet tropical biomes, in the Asian and African monsoon regions. Here, weak respiratory fractionation has the effect of reducing the Dole effect when wet tropical oxygenesis/respiration increases during warm phases of D/O events, even if the magnitude of the fractionation in that biome is constant. The key point is that respiration and hydrological-fractionation-with-oxygenesis have opposing effects in boreal biomes but constructive effects in tropical biomBender, M.L., Malaizé, B., Orchardo, J., Sowers, T., Jouzel, J., Mechanisms of Global Climate Change at Millennial Time Scales (1999) Geophysical Monograph Series, 112, pp. 149-164. , P.
