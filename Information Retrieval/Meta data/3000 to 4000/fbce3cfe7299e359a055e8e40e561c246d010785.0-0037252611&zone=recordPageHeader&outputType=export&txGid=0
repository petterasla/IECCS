Winter stemflow leaching from the leafless crowns of deciduous trees is less well understood, especially in the context of global climate change. Boreal and northern temperate forests are forecast to have a lower incidence of snow events and an increased frequency of rain and mixed precipitation events. A change in the seasonal precipitation regime may be significant due to linkages among global change, stemflow leaching, and biogeochemical processes. The aim of this paper is to (1) demonstrate the extent of winter stemflow nutrient leaching from deciduous trees; (2) explore how winter stemflow leachate quantity may vary as a function of the type of precipitation event; and (3) quantify the extent to which an increase in the incidence of snow-to-rain events would enhance stemflow leaching. Measuring meteorological conditions, stemflow volumes, and stemflow chemistry over two successive winter seasons in New England demonstrated that winter stemflow drainage was significantly enriched compared to the incident bulk precipitation: 162 times greater for K+, 44 times greater for Ca2+, and 29 times greater for Mg2+. Snow-to-rain events leached considerably greater quantities of base cations from the deciduous trees than all other types of precipitation events. An increased frequency of snow-to-rain events from 13.8% to 25% of winter precipitation events would substantially increase mean stemflow nutrient inputs to the bases of forest trees during winter. Implications for significantly increased winter stemflow leachate inputs, corresponding to an increased incidence of snow-to-rain events, include a shift in the biogeographic range of species, delayed leaf emergence, and increased soil respiration.","Deciduous forest; Leaching; Snow-to-rain; Stemflow; Winter","deciduous forest; leaching; precipitation (climatology); seasonality; stemflow; United States",,,,,,"Aboal, J.R., Morales, D., Hernandez, M., Jimenez, M.S., The measurement and modelling of the variation of stemflow in a laurel forest in Tenerife, Canary Islands (1999) Journal of Hydrology, 221, pp. 161-175; Beven, K., Riverine flooding in a warmer Britain (1993) Geographical Journal, 159, pp. 157-161; Chang, S.C., Matzner, E., The effect of beech stemflow on spatial patterns of soil solution chemistry and seepage fluxes in a mixed beech/oak stand (2000) Hydrological Processes, 14, pp. 135-144; Changnon, S.A., Huff, F.A., Potential effects of changed climates on heavy rainfall frequencies in the Midwest (1991) Water Resources Bulletin, 27, pp. 753-759; Clifford, N.J., Hydrology: The changing paradigm (2002) Progress in Physical Geography, 26, pp. 290-301; Devore, J., Peck, R., (1993) Statistics: The Exploration and Analysis of Data, , Duxbury Press.
