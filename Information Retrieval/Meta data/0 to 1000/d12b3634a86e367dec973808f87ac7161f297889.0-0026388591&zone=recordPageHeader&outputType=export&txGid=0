Large quantities of carbon dioxide are emitted to the atmosphere by many sources, both natural and Manmade. Electric power generation by any fossil fuel burning produces carbon dioxide. In order to better understand the greenhouse problem, this paper discusses the quantity of carbon dioxide produced; where does it go and what impact does it have? This information may better prepare the electric utilities to address future public concerns and the related regulatory pressure regarding the carbon dioxide proliferation and the global warming. © 1991 IEEE","Carbon dioxide proliferation; environmental impact; global warming; greenhouse effects","Carbon Dioxide; Electric Power Generation; Electric Utilities--United States; Emissions; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Fuels; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect",,,,,,"National Energy Policy Act of 1988 and Global Wanning (1988) Hearings Before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, , U.S. Senate, August 11, September 19 and 20; Energy Policy Implications of Global Warming (1988) Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, , U.S. House of Representative, July 7 and September 22; Carbon Dioxide and the Greenhouse Effect (1984) Hearings Before the Committee on Science and Technology, , U.S. House of Representative, February 28; Schneider, S.H., The Greenhouse Effect: Science and Policy (1989) SCIENCE, 243, pp. 771-781. , February; Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate Change (1989), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C., draftRevkin, A.C., Endless Summer: Living with the Greenhouse Effect (1988), pp. 50-61. , DISCOVER, OctoberTrace Gas Trends and Their Potential Role in Climate Change (1985) Journal of Geophysical Research, , June 20; Graedel, T.E., Crutzen, P.J., The Changing Atmosphere (1989), pp. 58-68. , Scientific American, SeptemberRotty, R.M., Global Carbon Dioxide Production from Fossil Fuels and Cement, A.D. 1950-A.D. 2000 (1977) “The Fate of Fossil Fuel C02 in the Oceans,”, , in N.R.
