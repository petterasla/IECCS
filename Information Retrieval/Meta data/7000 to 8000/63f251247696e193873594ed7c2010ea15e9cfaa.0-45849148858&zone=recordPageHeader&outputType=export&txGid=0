In Singapore, biomass resources are mostly from waste wood. This article presents a few technological options, namely carbonization, for the conversion of woody biomass into a solid fuel, charcoal. Materials and methods: In the first stage, a life cycle assessment (LCA) 'gate-to-gate' system was developed for a conventional carbonizer system, a modern carbonizer from Japan, and a proposed four-stage partial furnace carbonizer from Tunisia. The potential environmental impacts were generated for global warming potential, acidification, human toxicity and photochemical oxidant potential. Based on the first set of results, the second LCA investigation was carried out comparing the selected carbonizer from Japan and an existing incinerator in Singapore. The second LCA adopted a unique approach combining social costs of pollution with the economic factors of the two biomass conversion technologies. Results: The carbonizer from Japan resulted in approximately 85% less greenhouse gases than the conventional carbonization system and 54% less than the proposed four-stage carbonizer from Tunisia. In terms of acidification and human toxicity, the carbonizers from Japan and Tunisia display nearly similar results-both were considerably lower than the conventional carbonizer. For photochemical oxidant potential, very minimal emissions are generated from the four-stage carbonizer and nearly zero impact is realized for the carbonization technology from Japan. Discussion: From the first set of LCA results, the Japanese carbonizer is favored in terms of its environmental results. The highest environmental impacts from the conventional carbonizer were due to large and uncontrolled emissions of acidic gases, greenhouse gases (particularly CO2 and CH4), particulates, and non-methane volatile organic compounds from both fugitive sources and energy requirements. The second LCA addressed the performance of the carbonizer from Japan against an existing incinerator in terms of environmental as well as cost performances. This unique approach translated pollution emissions into monetary costs to highlight the impacts of social health. Conclusions: For the first LCA, the accumulated impacts from the Japanese carbonizer proved to display significantly lower environmental impacts, especially for global warming potential. The overall environmental performance of the four-stage carbonizer from Tunisia ranked slightly lower than the one from Japan and much higher than the conventional carbonizer. The second LCA results displayed a noteworthy improvement of 90% for human health from the modern Japanese carbonizer technology-when compared against conventional incinerators. Without considering health issues or social costs, the total value per ton of wood treated is nearly similar for both incinerator and carbonizer. Recommendations and perspectives: The interest in biomass as raw material for producing energy has emerged rapidly in many countries. However, careful analysis and comparison of technologies are necessary to ensure favorable environmental outcomes. A full life cycle study, along with costs and the impact of pollution on society, should be performed before any large-scale biomass conversion technology is implemented. LCA can be applied to quantify and verify the overall environmental performance of a particular technology of interest as well as further explore the proposed technology in terms of costs and social implications. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Air emissions; Biomass utilization; Carbonization; Gate-to-gate; Incineration; Social costs","charcoal; fuel; acidification; article; biomass energy; carbonization; chemical reaction; device; furnace; greenhouse effect; health hazard; incineration; photochemical smog; priority journal; Singapore; technology",,"charcoal, 16291-96-6",,,,"(2005) Report for Exhaust Gas Analysis (in Japanese), , Actree Corp; Astrup, T., Rosenblad, C., Trapp, S., Christensen, T.H., Chromium release from waste incineration air-pollution-control residues (2005) Env Sci Technol, 39, pp. 3321-3329; Bhattacharya, S.C., Sett, S., Shrestha, R.M., Two approaches for producing briquetted charcoal from wastes and their comparison (1990) Energy, 15, pp. 499-506; Finkbeiner, M., Inaba, I., Tan, R.B.H., Christiansen, K., Klüppel, H.J., The new international standards for life cycle assessment: ISO 14040 and 14044 (2006) Int J LCA, 11, pp. 80-85; Halouani, K., Farhat, H., Depollution of atmospheric emissions of wood pyrolysis furnaces (2003) Ren Energy, 28, pp. 129-138; (2002) Environmental and Health Impact of Solid Waste Management Activities: Issues in Environmental Science and Technology, , Hester RE, Harrison RM (eds) Royal Society of Chemistry, Manchester; Hofstetter, P., (1999) Perspectives in Life Cycle Impact Assessment: A Structured Approach to Combine Models of the Technosphere, Ecosphere, and Valuesphere, , Kluwer London; Khoo, H.H., Tan, R.B.H., Life cycle and feasibility study of developing a high yield technology for biomass-to-charcoal production (2005) 2nd Biomass-Asia Workshop, , Dec. 13-15, Bangkok, Thailand; Khoo, H.H., Tan, R.B.H., Salim, S., Wu, Y.M., Aravossis, K., Brebbia, C.A., Kakaras, E., Kungolos, A.G., Life cycle evaluation and economic considerations of the pyrolysis-gasification of municipal solid waste in Singapore (2006) Environmental Economics and Investment Assessment, pp. 43-54. , WIT Southampton; Moscowitz, C.M., (1978) Source Assessment: Charcoal Manufacturing State of the Art, , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Report No. EPA-600/2-78-004z, Cincinnati, USA; (2007), http://app.nea.gov.sg/, National Environmental AgencyQuah, E., Boon, T.L., The economic cost of particulate air pollution on health in Singapore (2003) J Asia Econs, 14, pp. 73-90; Schenkel, Y., Temmerman, M., Van Belle, J.F., Vankerkove, R., New indicator for the evaluation of wood carbonization process (1999) Energy Source, 21, pp. 935-943; Spadaro, J.V., Rabl, A., Air pollution damage estimates: The cost per kilogram of pollutant (2002) Int J Risk Assess Manage, 3, pp. 75-98; (2003) Life Cycle Assessment for Green Productivity: An Asian Perspective, , Tan RBH (ed) Asian Productivity Organization (APO), Tokyo; Tan, R.B.H., Khoo, H.H., Impact assessment of waste management options in Singapore (2006) J Air Waste Manage Assoc, 56, pp. 244-254; Walter, E., (1985) Handbook of Charcoal Making: State of the Art, , Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development Cincinnati","Khoo, H.
