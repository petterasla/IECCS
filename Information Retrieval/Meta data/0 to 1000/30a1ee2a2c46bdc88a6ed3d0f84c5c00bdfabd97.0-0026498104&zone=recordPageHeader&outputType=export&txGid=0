The relationship between radiative forcing and concentration is given for each trace gas. The results show that (i) the radiative forcing and then the greenhouse effect are significantly affected by the overlapping of atmospheric absorption bands; (ii) the increasing concentration of trace gases other than CO2, such as CH4, N2O, CFCs, etc., may potentially play an important role in the future global warming; (iii) the proposed substitutes, such as HCFC124 and HFC125, for the chlorofluorocarbons which are considered to destroy the ozone layer have still considerable greenhouse effect even though their ozone depletion potentials are much smaller than CFCs; and (iv) the feedback processes within the earth-atmosphere system have important effect on the surface temperature change due to the radiative forcing to the system. © 1992.","greenhouse effect; radiative forcing","CFC; greenhouse effect; radiative forcing; radiative-convective model; trace gas",,,,,,,"Shi, G.-y.; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Academia Sinica, Beijing, 100029, China",,,,,,,,1001652X,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026498104
