The mass propagation of jellyfish has inflicted great damage to the economy worldwide. Therefore, in order to instantly determine the possible types of jellyfish, DNA barcode data analysis was conducted using molecular markers. DNA chip technology is an efficient method for species-level identification and, as such, will contribute powerfully to taxonomic and biodiversity research. In order to identify jellyfish species, the mitochondrial COI gene, which has been shown to be widely applicable in animal barcoding, was used; the selected species-specific probe was 23 bp and was printed onto silylated slides using a robotic microarrayer. Additionally, COI genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of jellyfish using the primers LCO1490 and HCO2198 targeted to COI. In this study, we amplified and analyzed species-specific COI sequences for six jellyfish species (Aequorea coerulescens, Aurelia aurita, Bolinopsis sp., Cyanea nozakii, Dactylometra quinquecirrha, Nemopilema nomurai) collected at Jangmok Bay in Geoje. Herein, we describe each of the jellyfish species detected via microarray analysis. As a result, the COI barcode sequence technique was found to be suitable for the identification of jellyfish from South Korea. © 2011 The Korean BioChip Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Barcode; DNA chip; Jellyfish; Microarray analysis; Mitochondrial COI gene","Bar codes; Biodiversity; Genes; Global warming; Mitochondria; Aurelia; DNA chip; DNA chip technology; Environmental change; Exponential increase; Genomic DNA; Jellyfish; Mass propagation; Microarray analysis; Microarrayers; Molecular marker; South Korea; DNA; genomic DNA; molecular marker; Aequorea coerulescens; article; aurelia aurita; Bolinopsis; Cyanea nozakil; cytochrome c oxidase I gene; Dactylometra quinquecirrha; DNA barcoding; DNA microarray; gene amplification; jellyfish; microarray analysis; mitochondrial gene; Nemopilema nomurai; nonhuman; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Korea; species identification",,,,,,"Brodeur, R.D., Rise and fall of jellyfish in the eastern Bering Sea in relation to climate regime shifts (2008) Prog.
