It is proposed that if the near-future attempts of the United Nations to restrict the emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels end up with failure, it would be a rational alternative to increase the contribution of anthropogenic NH3, the only alkaline gaseous molecule in the troposphere, so as to partly neutralize atmospheric carbonic acid in aerosols in the form of ammonium bicarbonate, which would be eventually swept away by precipitation to the oceans where the HCO3 - species is stable. Thus, addition of ammonium N-compounds to infertile nonurban land, especially in the form of urea, is recommended to enable volatilization losses of NH3 to the atmosphere. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Ammonia; Atmospheric neutralization; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Green house gas","Ammonium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Alkaline gaseous molecules; Ammonium bicarbonates; Atmospheric neutralization; Global warming",,,,,,"Houghton, J.T, Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M., Van der Linden, P.J., Dai, X., Maskell, K., & Johnson, C.A.
