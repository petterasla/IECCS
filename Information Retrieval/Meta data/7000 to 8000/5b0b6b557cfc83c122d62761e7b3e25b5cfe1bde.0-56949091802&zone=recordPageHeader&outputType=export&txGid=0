People damage the environment through local activities like clearing land or burning fossil fuels, but the damages only become manifest at larger regional or global scales where no one pays for them. Payments for ecological services like carbon sequestration can correct for these damages caused by scale mismatches. This paper presents a spatially explicit land-use model to investigate the consequences of scale mismatches for pollination and carbon storage services and examine the effect of payment for only carbon storage services. The model integrates processes in multiple spatial scales ranging from the parcel level used by landowners' decision about deforestation, to the larger scale used by animals to pollinate plants, and finally to the global scale where carbon storage services are supplied. We show that payment for carbon storage services can become an effective mechanism to protect forests at the same time that it creates inequities among landowners in income level. These findings suggest that market-based approaches that focus on conservation of a single ecosystem service may reproduce unequal power relations among landowners. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Decision making; Deforestation; Equity; Land-use change; Markov chain model; Payment of environmental services","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; clearcutting; decision making; ecological impact; economic impact; human activity; landscape; modeling; Animalia",,,,,,"Achard, F., Eva, H.D., Stibig, H.-J., Mayaux, P., Gallego, J., Richards, T., Malingreau, J.-P., Determination of deforestation rates of the world's humid tropical forests (2002) Science, 297, pp. 999-1002; Adger, W.N., Brown, K., Fairbrass, J., Jordan, A., Paavola, J., Rosendo, S., Seyfang, G., Governance for sustainability: towards a 'thick' analysis of environmental decision making (2003) Environment and Planning A, 35, pp. 1095-1110; Aizen, M.A., Feinsinger, P., Forest fragmentation, pollination, and plant reproduction in a chaco dry forest (1994) Argentina.
