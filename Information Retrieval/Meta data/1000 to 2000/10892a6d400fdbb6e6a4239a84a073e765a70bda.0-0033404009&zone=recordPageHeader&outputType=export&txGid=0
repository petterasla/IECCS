Thus the two are intimately interrelated and concepts from one find ready applications in the other. The temporal and spatial spread of ecological degradation across the earth's ecosystems has some of the characteristics of an epidemiologic process, with humans as the 'infective' agent. Elevated disease prevalence in both plants and animals is one of the key indicators of ecosystem pathology, and conversely, pathologic ecosystems place increased risks to the health of all components, thus ecosystem health becomes a major determinant of risks to the health of component populations. These relations suggest important links between the areas of epidemiology, phytopathology, and systems ecology. Understanding these links can provide enhanced capacities for diagnosis and risk assessment in all three areas.",,"disease prevalence; ecosystem health; epidemiology; Animalia",,,,,,"Anable, M.E., Mclaren, M.P., Ruyle, G.B., George, P., Spread of introduced Lehmann lovegrass, Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees, in southern Arizona, USA (1992) Biological Conservation, 61, pp. 181-188; Baquero, F., Blazquez, J., Evolution of antibiotic resistance (1997) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 12, pp. 482-487; Bird, P.M., Rapport, D.J., (1986) State of the Environment Report for Canada, , Government of Canada Publishing Centre, Ottawa; Birkett, S., Rapport, D.J., A framework for identifying and classifying ecosystem dysfunctions (1998) The Environmentalist, 18, pp. 15-25; Bormann, F.H., Ecology: A personal history (1996) Annual Review of Energy and Environment, 21, pp. 1-29; Botsford, L.W., Castilla, J.C., Peterson, C.H., The management of fisheries and marine ecosystems (1997) Science, 277, pp. 509-515; Diamond, J.M., (1997) Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, , W.
