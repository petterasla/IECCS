However, the effects of dynamic ice conditions on riverine biota are little known. 2.We studied the formation of anchor ice in natural streams over 2years and assessed the effects of anchor ice on riparian vegetation by comparing sites with frequent or abundant and little or no anchor ice formation. We also studied the direct impact of ice on riparian plants by experimentally creating ice in the riparian zone over three winters and by exposing plants of different life forms to -18°C cold ice in the laboratory. 3.Riparian species richness per 1-m 2 plot was higher at sites affected by anchor ice than at sites where anchor ice was absent or rare, whereas dominance was lower, suggesting that disturbance by ice enhances species richness. Species composition was more homogenous among plots at anchor ice sites. By experimentally creating riparian ice, we corroborated the comparative results, with species richness increasing in ice-treated plots compared to controls, irrespective of whether the sites showed natural anchor ice. 4.Because of human alterations of running waters, the natural effects of river ice on stream hydrology, geomorphology and ecology are little known. Global warming in northern streams is expected to lead to more dynamic ice conditions, offering new challenges for aquatic organisms and river management. Our results should stimulate new research, contributing to a better understanding of ecosystem function during winter. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Anchor ice; Frazil ice; Riparian vegetation; Rivers; Sweden",,,,,,,"Anderson, M.J., A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (2001) Austral Ecology, 26, pp. 32-46; Andersson, E., Nilsson, C., Johansson, M.E., Plant dispersal in boreal rivers and its relation to the diversity of riparian flora (2000) Journal of Biogeography, 27, pp. 1095-1106; Andréasson, J., Bergström, S., Carlsson, B., Graham, L.P., Lindström, G., Hydrological change: climate change impact simulations for Sweden (2004) Ambio, 33, pp. 228-234; Auble, G.T., Scott, M.L., Fluvial disturbance patches and cottonwood recruitment along the upper Missouri River, Montana (1998) Wetlands, 18, pp. 546-556; Barrineau, C.E., Hubert, W.A., Dey, P.D., Annear, T.C., Winter ice processes and pool habitat associated with two types of constructed instream structures (2005) North American Journal of Fisheries Management, 25, pp. 1022-1033; Beltaos, S., Effects of climate on mid-winter ice jams (2002) Hydrological Processes, 16, pp. 789-804; Beltaos, S., Prowse, T., River-ice hydrology in a shrinking cryosphere (2009) Hydrological Processes, 23, pp. 122-144; Beltaos, S., Prowse, T.D., Carter, T., Ice regime of the lower Peace River and ice-jam flooding of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (2006) Hydrological Processes, 20, pp. 4009-4029; Bradt, P., Urban, M., Goodman, N., Bissell, S., Spiegel, I., Stability and resilience in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages (1999) Hydrobiologia, 403, pp. 123-133; Connell, J.H., Diversity in tropical rain forests and coral reefs (1978) Science, 199, pp. 1302-1310; Crawley, M.J., (2002) Statistical Computing: An Introduction to Data Analysis using S-Plus, , John Wiley, West Sussex, England; Cunjak, R.A., Prowse, T.D., Parrish, D.L., Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in winter: ""the season of parr discontent""?
