Both the distributions of planktonic organisms and their timing of occurrence in the seasonal cycle have changed and these changes appear to reflect global warming. In the North Sea the planktonic larvae of echinoderms have shown a recent dramatic increase in both relative and absolute abundance and their seasonal peak of occurrence has advanced by 47 days. The identity of the echinoderm larvae involved in this change has, however, remained equivocal. The small size of many organisms like echinoderm larvae combined with incomplete taxonomic keys hinders their visual identification and their fragility often means that useful morphological features are damaged during sampling by the CPR. Here, using new molecular methods applied to CPR samples, we show that planktonic larvae of the benthic Echinocardium cordatum dominate the North Sea plankton. We argue that since this species benefits from mild winters and warmer waters their numerical increase in the plankton is consistent with recent climatic changes that appear to be affecting the wider ecology of this region.",,"climate change; plankton; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; oceanic regions; World; Echinocardium cordatum; Echinodermata",,,,,,"Batten, S.D., CPR sampling: The technical background, materials and methods, and issues of consistency and comparability (2003) Progress in Oceanography, 58, pp. 193-215; Beaugrand, G., Ibañez, F., Reid, P.C., Geographical distribution and seasonal and diel changes in the diversity of calanoid copepods in the North Atlantic and North Sea (2001) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 219, pp. 189-203; Beaugrand, G., Brande, K.M., Lindley, J.A., Souissi, S., Reid, P.C., Plankton effect on cod recruitment in the North Sea (2003) Nature, London, 426, pp. 661-664; Beaugrand, G., Reid, P.C., Ibañez, F., Lindley, J.A., Edwards, M., Reorganization of Atlantic marine copepod biodiversity and climate (2002) Science, New York, 296, pp. 1692-1694; Boom, R., Sol, C.J.A., Salimans, M.M.M., Jansen, C.I., Wertheim-Van Dillen, P.M.E., Van Der Noordaa, J., Rapid and simple method for purification of nucleic acids (1990) Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 28, pp. 495-503; Buchanan, J.B., Evidence of benthic pelagic coupling at a station off the Northumberland coast (1993) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 172, pp. 1-10; Bucklin, A., Allen, L.D., MtDNA sequencing from zooplankton after long-term preservation in buffered formalin (2004) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 30, pp. 879-882; Bucklin, A., Bentley, A.M., Franzen, S.P., Distribution and relative abundance of Pseudocalanus moultoni and P. newmani (Copepoda: Calanoida) on Georges Bank using molecular identification of sibling species (1998) Marine Biology, 132, pp. 97-106; Callaway, R., Diversity and community structure of epibenthic invertebrates and fish in the North Sea (2002) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 59, pp. 1199-1214; Caudill, C.C., Bucklin, A., Molecular phylogeography and evolutionary history of the estuarine copepod, Acartia tonsa, on the Northwest Atlantic coast (2004) Hydrobiologia, 511, pp. 91-102; Clark, A.M., Downey, M.E., (1992) Starfishes of the Atlantic, , London: Chapman and Hall; Clark, P.F., A comparative study of zoeal morphology in the genus Liocarcinus (Crustacea: Brachyura: Portunidae) (1984) Zoological Journal of the Linneaen Society, 82, pp. 219-254; Coombs, N.J., Gough, A.C., Primrose, J.N., Optimisation of DNA and RNA extraction from archival formalin-fixed tissue (1999) Nucleic Acids Research, 27, pp. e12; Ellis, J.R., Rogers, S.I., The distribution, relative abundance and diversity of echinoderms in the eastern English Channel, Bristol Channel and Irish Sea (2000) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 80, pp. 127-138; France, S.C., Kocher, T.D., DNA sequencing of formalin-fixed crustaceans from archival research collections (1996) Molecular Marine Biology and Biotechnology, 5, pp. 304-313; Frost, B.W., A taxonomy of the marine calanoid copepod genus Pseudocalanus (1989) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 67, pp. 525-551; Geiger, S.R., Echinodermata: Larvae.
