Material life cycle assessment (MLCA) was carried out hi actual diecasting factory that produces various lightweight aluminum and magnesium components to obtain life cycle inventory data, quantify environmental impacts and finally try to get solutions for environmental improvement. In diecasting process, most of environmental impacts come from melting of raw materials for abiotic resource depletion and global warming due to burning gas and electricity used. The problem of photochemical oxidant creation is induced by spraying and lubricating steps.","Diecasting; Light materials; Material life cycle assessment","Material life cycle assessment (MLCA); Aluminum; Combustion; Electricity; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Lubrication; Magnesium printing plates; Materials science; Melting; Photooxidation; Raw materials; Spraying; Die casting",,,,,,"Kaplan, H.I., Hyrn, J.N., Clow, B.B., (2000) Proc.
