It is likely that China will have to face the challenge of CBTA (carbon motivated border tax adjustments) in future. Meanwhile, CBTA would create price gap between CBTA users and target countries, and change the competitiveness of different producers. Under such circumstances, this paper seeks to contribute to the debate on CBTA by focusing on the potential impacts of CBTA on different regions of China from a perspective of competitiveness. We adopt two geographical divides in China (eastern-central-western zones, high-trade-openness to low-trade-openness regions), and simulate the potential impacts across regions through a general equilibrium model. Our simulation results show that CBTA would affect competitiveness of different producers, their comparative advantages, relative trade shares, outputs and emissions. CBTA would induce structure change of the economy, and result in a shift of industrial output toward non-industrial output. There are significant differences in the effects of CBTA among different regions in China. CBTA would result in a relocation of outputs across regions in China. Therefore, CBTA would also have impact on China's regional development policy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon leakage; Carbon motivated border tax adjustments; Competitiveness issue; Computable general equilibrium model; Global climate change","Border tax adjustments; Carbon intensity; Carbon leakage; Comparative advantage; Competitiveness issue; Computable general equilibrium model; General equilibrium models; Global climate changes; Industrial outputs; Potential impacts; Regional development; Simulation result; Structure change; Climate change; Climate models; Commerce; Developing countries; Economics; Regional planning; Competition; carbon emission; climate change; competitiveness; developing world; environmental economics; equilibrium; global change; industrial production; numerical model; pollution tax; price dynamics; regional development; relocation; tax system; China",,,,,,"(1992) United Nations framework convention on climate change, , United Nations; (2007) Intergovernmental panel on climate change, climate change 2007: mitigation of climate change, summary for policymakers contribution of working group iii to the intergovernmental panel on climate change fourth assessment, , Cambridge University Press; Bernard, A., Vielle, M., Assessment of European Union transition scenarios with a special focus on the issue of carbon leakage (2009) Energy Economics, 31 (2), pp. 274-284; Markusen, J.R., International externalities and optimal tax structures (1975) Journal of International Economics, 5, pp. 15-29; Grubb, M., Niehoff, K., Allocation and competitiveness in the EU emissions trading scheme: policy overview (2006) Climate Policy, 6 (1), pp. 137-160; Houser, T., Bradley, R., Childs, B., Werksman, J., Heilmayr, R., (2008) Levelingthe carbon playing field: international competition and US climate policy design, , Peterson Institute for International Economics and World Resources Institute, Washington, DC; Kuik, O., Hofkes, M., Border adjustment for European emissions trading: competitiveness and carbon leakage (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (4), pp. 1741-1748. , 1994; Fischer, C., Fox, K.A., (2009) Comparing policies to combat emissions leakage, , Resources for the Future Discussion Paper, 09-02; De Cendra, J., Can emissions trading schemes be coupled with border tax adjustments?
