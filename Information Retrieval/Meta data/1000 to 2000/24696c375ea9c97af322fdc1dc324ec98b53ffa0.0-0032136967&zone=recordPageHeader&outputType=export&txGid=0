It enables these systems to be optimized for minimum global warming impact. In previous studies1,2,3, the energies required to manufacture the greenhouse gases themselves were not included; by analogy with other chemical manufacturing processes they were assumed to be small in the context of climate change. In the work described here, climate change impacts from the energy used to produce a number of common refrigerant fluids are evaluated. These impacts are compared with the potential impact on global warming from the other components of TEWI: use and disposal of the refrigerants, including direct release into the environment. It is shown that the implications for climate change of the production of traditional refrigerants like ammonia, hydrocarbons or CFC-12 and new refrigerating fluids, such as HFC-134a, are truly insignificant in comparison with other stages of the life cycle of a refrigerator and have no role in TEWI. © Institution of Chemical Engineers.",,,,,,,,"Fischer, S.K., Hughes, P.J., Fairchild, P.D., Kusik, C.L., Dieckmann, J.T., McMahon, E.M., Hobday, N., (1991) Energy and Global Warming Impact of CFC Alternative Technologies, , (US Dept of Energy and AFEAS (Alternative Fluorocarbons Environmental Acceptability Study), 1333 H Street NW, Washington DC 20005, USA); Fischer, S.K., Tomlinson, J.J., Hughes, P.J., (1994) Energy and Global Warming Impacts of Not-in-kind and next Generation CFC and HCFC Alternatives, , (US Dept of Energy and AFEAS (as above)); Sand, J.R., Fischer, S.K., Baxter, V.D., (1997) Energy and Global Warming Impacts of HFC Refrigerants and Emerging Technologies, , (US Dept of Energy and AFEAS (as above)); (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change (Contribution of WGI to the Second Assessment Report of IPCC), 572p. , Chapter 8, Houghton, J.
