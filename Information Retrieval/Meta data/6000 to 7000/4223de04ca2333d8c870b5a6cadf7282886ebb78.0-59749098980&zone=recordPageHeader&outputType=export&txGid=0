This increased CO 2 is believed to be responsible for a significant rise in global temperature over the past several decades. Global-scale climate modeling suggests that the temperature increase will continue, at least over the next few hundred years, leading to glacial melting and rising sea levels. Increased atmospheric CO 2 also leads to ocean acidification, which will have drastic consequences for marine ecosystems. In an attempt to solve these problems, many have proposed the large-scale sequestration of CO 2 from our atmosphere. This introductory article presents a summary of some of the evidence linking increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration to global warming and ocean acidification and our efforts to stem this rise though CO 2 sequestration.","CO 2 sequestration; Global carbon cycle; Global warming; Ocean acidification","acidification; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); fossil fuel; global warming; seawater",,,,,,"Adams, E.E., Caldeira, K., Ocean storage of CO 2 (2008) Elements, 4, pp. 319-324; Andersson, A.J., Mackenzie, F.T., Lerman, A., Costal ocean CO 2-carbonic acid-carbonate sediment system of the Anthropocene (2006) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 20. , GB1S92; Benson, S.M., Cole, D.R., CO 2 sequestration in deep sedimentary formations (2008) Elements, 4, pp. 325-331; Broecker, W.S., Thermohaline circulation, the Achilles heel of our climate system: Will man-made CO 2 upset the current balance?
