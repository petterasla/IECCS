A combination of model simulations and observational studies of a recent wide-scale drought, suggested that the drought induced substantial terrestrial ecosystem carbon loss, but hypothesized mechanisms could not be evaluated via comparison to a control. Here, we investigated carbon-cycle responses to climate changes by combining results from a controlled 15-year ecosystem warming experiment in montane grassland with observational data from before and during the recent drought. We found that both experimental warming and real-world drought induced substantial soil carbon loss in our study system, and that the same mechanism, a drying-induced shift in plant species composition and an associated decline in community productivity, provides a common explanation for these declines in soil carbon. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon; Climate; Drought; Feedback; Vegetation","Carbon; Climate change; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Feedback; Vegetation; Climate; Climate feedbacks; Global climate changes; Model simulation; Observational data; Observational study; Plant species composition; Terrestrial ecosystems; Drought",,,,,,"Manabe, S., Wetherald, R.T., Milly, P.C.D., Delworth, T.L., Stouffer, R.J., Century-scale change in water availability: CO2-quadrupling experiment (2004) Clim.
