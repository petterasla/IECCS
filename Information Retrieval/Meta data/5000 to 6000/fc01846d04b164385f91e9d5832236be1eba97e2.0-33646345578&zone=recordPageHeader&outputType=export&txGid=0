For each of the models, an oceanic state corresponding to the A1B stabilization experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of 720 ppm) is compared to a state corresponding to the preindustrial control experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of 280 ppm). In all of the models, the first baroclinic Rossby radius increases with increasing oceanic stratification in the warmer climate. There is, however, a considerable range among the models in the magnitude of the increase. At the latitudes of intense eddy activity associated with instability of western boundary currents (around 35°-40°), the increase reaches 4 km on average, or about 15% of the local baroclinic Rossby radius. Some of the models predict an increase of the baroclinic Rossby radius by more than 20% at these latitudes under the applied forcing. It is therefore suggested that in a plausible future warmer climate, the characteristic length scale of mesoscale eddies, as well as boundary currents and fronts, may increase. In addition, since the speed of long baroclinic Rossby waves is proportional to the squared baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation, the results suggest that the time scale for large-scale dynamical oceanic adjustment may decrease in the warmer climate, thereby increasing the frequency of long-term climate variability where the oceanic Rossby wave dynamics set the dominant period. Finally, the speed of equatorial Kelvin waves and Rossby waves, carrying signals along the equator, including those related to ENSO, is projected to increase. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Global warming; Mathematical models; Oceanography; Climate variability; Kelvin wave; Ocean; Ocean-atmosphere general circulation model; Oceanic stratification; Rossby radius; Rossby wave; Climatology; air-sea interaction; atmospheric general circulation model; baroclinic mode; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; Kelvin wave; oceanic current; oceanic general circulation model; Rossby wave; stratification",,,,,,"Chelton, D.B., deSzoeke, R.A., Schlax, M.G., Naggar, K.E.I., Siwertz, N., Geographical variability of the first-baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation (1998) J.
