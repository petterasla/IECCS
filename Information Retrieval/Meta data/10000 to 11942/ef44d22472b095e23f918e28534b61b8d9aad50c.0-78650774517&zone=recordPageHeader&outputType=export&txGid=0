While wheat is grown over a wide range of environments, it is common in the major wheat-producing countries for grain filling to occur when soil moisture is declining and temperature is increasing. Average global temperatures have increased over the last decades and are predicted to continue rising, along with a greater frequency of extremely hot days. Such events have already been reported for major wheat growing regions in the world. However, the direct impact of past temperature variability and changes in averages and extremes on wheat production has not been quantified. Attributing changes in observed yields over recent decades to a single factor such as temperature is not possible due to the confounding effects of other factors. By using simulation modelling, we were able to separate the impact of temperature from other factors and show that the effect of temperature on wheat production has been underestimated. Surprisingly, observed variations in average growing-season temperatures of ±2°C in the main wheat growing regions of Australia can cause reductions in grain production of up to 50%. Most of this can be attributed to increased leaf senescence as a result of temperatures >34°C. Temperature conditions during grain filling in the major wheat growing regions of the world are similar to the Australian conditions during grain filling. With average temperatures and the frequency of heat events projected to increase world-wide with global warming, yield reductions due to higher temperatures during the important grain-filling stage alone could substantially undermine future global food security. Adaptation strategies need to be considered now to prevent substantial yield losses in wheat from increasing future heat stress. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","APSIM; Crop simulation; Evapotranspiration; Heat stress; Wheat","climate change; crop production; environmental stress; global warming; modeling; temperature effect; wheat; yield; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",,,,,,"Alexander, L.V., Zhang, X., Peterson, T.C., Global observed changes in daily climate extremes of temperature and precipitation (2006) Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres, 111, pp. 1-22; Asseng, S., Wheat Crop Systems: A Simulation Analysis (2004), CSIRO Publishing, MelbourneAsseng, S., Bar-Tal, A., Bowden, J.W., Simulation of grain protein content with APSIM-Nwheat (2002) European Journal of Agronomy, 16, pp. 25-42; Asseng, S., Fillery, I.R.P., Anderson, G.C., Dolling, P.J., Dunin, F.X., Keating, B.A., Use of the APSIM wheat model to predict yield, drainage, and NO3-leaching for a deep sand (1998) Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 49, pp. 363-377; Asseng, S., Fillery, I.R.P., Dunin, F.X., Keating, B.A., Meinke, H., Potential deep drainage under wheat crops in a Mediterranean climate.
