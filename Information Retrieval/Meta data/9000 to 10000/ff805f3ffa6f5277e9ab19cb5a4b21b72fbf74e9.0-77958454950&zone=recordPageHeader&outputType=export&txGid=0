Peripheral populations can exhibit unique patterns of habitat use in response to marginal conditions and can provide colonists adapted to novel or extreme environments. We conducted surveys for American pikas (Ochotona princeps) during 20072009 in 144 sites in Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, Idaho. This species appears vulnerable to global climate change, and Craters of the Moon is an extensive area of low-elevation lava habitat situated on an interior edge of the species' range. We found pikas to be readily detectable when both direct and indirect sign were used. An estimate of detection probability from a subset of 72 sites that were visited twice was 0.92. We detected pikas in 31 of survey sites overall but only at sites above 1,605 m. We used logistic regression to model the distribution of pikas as a function of elevation, substrate, and vegetation cover. Pikas were most likely to occur on structurally complex pahoehoe lava flows above 1,600 m. The odds of pika occurrence on pahoehoe lava was &gt;10 times that of aa lava flows and increased by 2 times for each SD increase in elevation. Pikas were also more likely to occur on lava flow sites with higher structural complexity and forb cover. An area of pahoehoe lava encompassing &gt;250 km2 in the northern portion of Craters of the Moon contained 91 of pika detections and all predicted site-occurrence probabilities &gt;0.38, an optimal cutoff value determined by examining model receiver operating characteristic curves. Craters of the Moon may provide long-term refugia for the species, given the extent of lava habitat there. However, the importance of elevation in our models suggests that accelerated climate change could erode suitable pika habitat in the park. Most research on pikas has relied on censuses or nonrandom convenience surveys, but we demonstrate an efficient probabilistic sampling approach that has broad application for pika monitoring and research. © 2010 American Society of Mammalogists.","climate change; Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve; detection probability; elevation gradient; occupancy; Ochotona princeps; peripheral populations; spatially balanced sampling","adaptive radiation; climate change; conservation management; ecological modeling; environmental monitoring; estimation method; habitat use; lagomorph; landscape; lava flow; logistics; population distribution; range expansion; refugium; regression analysis; sampling; species occurrence; survey; vegetation cover; vulnerability; Idaho; United States; Ochotona princeps; Ochotonidae",,,,,,"Araú, J.O.M.B., Williams, P.H., Selecting areas for species persistence using occurrence data (2000) Biological Conservation, 96, pp. 331-345; Beever, E.A., Brussard, P.F., Berger, J., Patterns of apparent extirpation among isolated populations of pikas (Ochotona princeps) in the Great Basin (2003) Journal of Mammalogy, 84, pp. 37-54; Beever, E.A., Ray, C., Mote, P.W., Wilkening, J.L., Testing alternative modes of climate-mediated extirpation (2010) Ecological Applications, 20, pp. 164-178; Beever, E.A., Wilkening, J.L., Mcivor, E.D., Weber, S.S., Brussard, P.F., American pikas (Ochotona princeps) in northwestern Nevada: A newly discovered population at a low-elevation site (2008) Western North American Naturalist, 68, pp. 8-14; Bell, J., Cogan, D., Erixson, J.J., Von Loh, J., Vegetation inventory project report: Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (2009) National Park Service, Natural Resource Technical Report NPS/UCBN/NRTR-2009/277; Brown, J.H., Mammals on mountaintops: Nonequilibrium insular biogeography (1971) American Naturalist, 105, pp. 467-478; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , 2nd ed.
