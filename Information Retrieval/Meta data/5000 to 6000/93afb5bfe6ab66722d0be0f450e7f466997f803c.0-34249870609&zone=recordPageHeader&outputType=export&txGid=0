In 1998, high sea surface temperatures and low cloud cover in the western Pacific Ocean caused high coral mortality on the outer exposed reefs of Palau (Micronesia), while coral mortality in sheltered bays was low. Recovery was examined from 2001 to 2005 at 13 sites stratified by habitat (outer reefs, patch reefs and bays) and depth (3 and 10 m). Two hypotheses were tested: (1) rates of change of coral cover vary in accordance with habitat, and (2) recovery rates depend on recruitment. Coral cover increased most in the sheltered bays, despite a low recruitment rate, suggesting that recovery in bays was primarily a consequence of remnant regrowth. Recruitment densities were consistently high on the wave-exposed reefs, particularly the western slopes, where recovery was attributed to both recruitment and regrowth of remnants. Recovery was initially more rapid at 10 m than 3 m on outer reefs, but in 2004, recovery rates were similar at both depths. Rapid recovery was possible because Palau's coral reefs were buffered by remnant survival and recruitment from the less impacted habitats. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Bleaching; Corals; Habitats; Recovery; Recruitment","climate change; coral bleaching; coral reef; ecosystem resilience; global climate; habitat restoration; hypothesis testing; mortality; recruitment; regrowth; secondary succession; survival; Caroline Islands; Micronesia; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Palau; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Aronson, R.B., Precht, W.F., Conservation, precaution, and Caribbean reefs (2006) Coral Reefs, 25, pp. 441-450; Bena, C., Van Woesik, R., The impact of two bleaching events on the survival of small-coral colonies (2004) Bull Mar Sci, 75, pp. 115-125; Box, G.E.P., Cox, D.R., An analysis of transformations (1964) J Roy Stat Soc B, 26, pp. 211-234; Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching: Causes and consequences (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. 129-138; Bruno, J.F., Siddon, C.E., Witman, J.D., Colin, P.L., Toscano, M.A., El Niño related coral bleaching in Palau, Western Caroline Islands (2001) Coral Reefs, 20, pp. 127-136; Carlton, J.H., Done, T.J., Quantitative video sampling of coral reef benthos: Large-scale application (1995) Coral Reefs, 14, pp. 35-46; Chappell, J., Coral morphology, diversity and reef growth (1980) Nature, 286, pp. 249-252; Colgan, M., Coral reef recovery on Guam (Micronesia) after catastrophic predation by Acanthaster planci (1987) Ecology, 68, pp. 1592-1605; Connell, J.H., Diversity in tropical rain forests and coral reefs (1978) Science, 199, pp. 1302-1309; Darwin, C., (1842) The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, , Smith, Elder and Company London; Dollar, S., Wave stress and coral community structure in Hawaii (1982) Coral Reefs, 1, pp. 71-81; Dollar, S.J., Tribble, G.W., Recurrent storm disturbance and recovery: A long-term study of coral communities in Hawaii (1993) Coral Reefs, 12, pp. 223-233; Done, T.J., Patterns in the distribution of coral across the central Great Barrier Reef (1982) Coral Reefs, 1, pp. 95-107; Done, T.J., Simulation of the effects of Acanthaster planci on the population structure of massive corals in the genus porites: Evidence of population resilience?
