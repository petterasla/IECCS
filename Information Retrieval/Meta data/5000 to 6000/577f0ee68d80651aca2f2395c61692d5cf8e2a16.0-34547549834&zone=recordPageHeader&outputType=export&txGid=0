This paper discusses energy conservation in a vertically articulated three-joint manipulator with a rotation-pivot-pivot structure. The amount of dissipated energy can be decreased by canceling out the gravity on the second and the third links of the manipulator using a mass balancer or a spring balancer. Mass balancers are designed optimally by diminishing the inertia matrix so that the amount of dissipated energy can be minimized. Three kinds of counterbalancer systems, which include a mass-mass balancer, a spring-mass balancer and a spring-spring balancer, are designed optimally. Energy is compared among the three types of counterbalancers mounted on a three-link manipulator in simulation. The simulation indicates that a spring-mass balancer is more practical because of the considerable energy conservation effect and simplicity in implementation. In order to confirm the simulation results, the dissipated energy is measured experimentally using a practical system of a directly-driven manipulator on which a suboptimal mass-mass balancer or a spring-mass balancer is mounted. As a result, the measured dissipated energy is approximately the same as the result obtained by simulation. © 2007 VSP.","Energy conservation; Inertia; Mass balancer; Spring balancer; Vertically articulated manipulator","Computer simulation; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Robotics; Inertia; Mass balancer; Spring balancer; Vertically articulated manipulators; Manipulators",,,,,,"Singh, S., Leu, M.C., Optimal trajectory generation for robotic manipulators using dynamic programming (1987) Trans.
