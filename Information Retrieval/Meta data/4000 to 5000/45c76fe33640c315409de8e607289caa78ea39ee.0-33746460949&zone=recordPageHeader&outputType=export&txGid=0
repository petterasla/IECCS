These differences make it very difficult to predict how plant communities will respond to elevated CO2. Such information is critical to furthering our understanding of community and ecosystem responses to global climate change. To determine how a simple plant community might respond to elevated CO2, a model regenerating longleaf pine community composed of five species was exposed to two CO2 regimes (ambient, 365 μmol mol-1 and elevated, 720 μmol mol-1) for 3 yr. Total above- and belowground biomass was 70 and 49% greater, respectively, in CO2-enriched plots. Carbon (C) content followed a response pattern similar to biomass, resulting in a significant increase of 13.8 Mg C ha -1 under elevated CO2. Responses of individual species, however, varied. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) was primarily responsible for the positive response to CO2 enrichment. Wiregrass (Aristida stricta Michx.), rattlebox (Crotalaria rotundifolia Walt. Ex Gmel.), and butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa L.) exhibited negative above- and belowground biomsss responses to elevated CO2, while sand post oak (Quercus margaretta Ashe) did not differ significantly between CO2 treatments. As with pine, C content followed patterns similar to biomass. Elevated CO 2 resulted in alterations in community structure. Longleaf pine comprised 88% of total biomass in CO2-enriched plots, but only 76% in ambient plots. In contrast, wiregrass, rattlebox, and butterfly weed comprised 19% in ambient CO2 plots, but only 8% under high CO2. Therefore, while longleaf pine may perform well in a high CO2 world, other members of this community may not compete as well, which could alter community function. Effects of elevated CO2 on plant communities are complex, dynamic, and difficult to predict, clearly demonstrating the need for more research in this important area of global change science. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Community functions; Community structures; Global change science; Symbiotic relationships; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Morphology; Plants (botany); carbon; carbon dioxide; pine oil; unclassified drug; ambient air; Aristida stricta; Asclepias tuberosa; biomass; carbon utilization; community; conference paper; Crotalaria rotundifolia; ecosystem; global change; global climate; nitrogen concentration; nonhuman; oak; phenology; pine; plant growth; plant leaf; plant physiology; plant response; Quercus margaretta; Atmosphere; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Pinus; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Soil; Aristida stricta; Asclepias tuberosa; Crotalaria rotundifolia; Pinus palustris; Quercus margaretta; Quercus stellata",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; pine oil, 8002-09-3; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Soil",,,,"Abrahamson, W.G., Hartnett, D.C., Pine flatwoods and dry prairies (1990) Ecosystems of Florida, pp. 103-149. , R.L.
