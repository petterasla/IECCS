Mean annual flux rates of mass (1.1 g m-2), organic carbon (134 mg m-2), nitrogen (24 mg m-2), chlorophyll a (3 mg m-2) and biogenic silicon (11 mg m-2) were determined by deployment of two sediment traps from the Canadian Ice Island at a water depth of 100 m. High fluxes of mass, biogenic silicon and inorganic matter occurred between July and September during the melt-water runoff. Maximum sedimentation of organic matter and chlorophyll a occurred in August and September when centric diatoms and zooplankton fecal pellets were numerous in samples. Between February and June, when mass fluxes were low, settled particles were organically rich with low carbon:nitrogen ratios (4-8) in contrast to higher values (6-12) during the melt-water period. Mineralogy showed that chlorite, mica, illite and quartz were abundant in settled particles collected in August, October and December. Similar minerals, thought to be supplied as small particles by eolian transport, are present in ice cores and cryoconites on the Ice Island. The observations provide data for assessing future changes in production and particle export for this ice-covered region of the Arctic Ocean that may be altered due to global warming and related changes in ice cover. © 1993.",,"chemical composition; ice cover; seasonal variability; sedimentation; suspended particulate matter; Arctic Ocean; Arctic Ocean, Ellef Ringes Island",,,,,,"Alldredge, Abandoned larvacean houses: a unique food source in the pelagic environment (1972) Science, 177, pp. 885-887; Atkinson, Wacasey, Sedimentation in Arctic Canada: particulate organic carbon flux to a shallow marine benthic community in Frobisher Bay (1987) Polar Biology, 8, pp. 3-7; Bishop, Regional extremes in particulate matter composition and flux: effects of chemistry of the ocean interior (1989) Productivity of the Oceans: Present and Past, pp. 117-137. , Berger W.H., Smatacek V.S., Wefer G., Wiley, New York; Carey, Jr., (1985) Marine ice fauna: Sea ice biota, pp. 173-190. , Horner R.A., CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida; Carey, Jr., Particle flux beneath fast ice in the shallow southwestern Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean (1987) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 40, pp. 247-257; Carmack, Large-scale physical oceanography of polar oceans (1990) Polar oceanography, Part A: physical science, pp. 122-171. , Smith W.O.
