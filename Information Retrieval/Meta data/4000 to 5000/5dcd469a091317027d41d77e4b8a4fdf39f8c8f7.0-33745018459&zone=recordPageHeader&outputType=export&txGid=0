Particularly, developing countries are project to grow slower with a purchasing power exchange rate than with a market exchange rate. Different exchange rates may lead to scenarios with very different per capita incomes. However, these scenarios also assume convergence of energy intensities, which at least partly offsets the income effect, so that scenarios with different exchange rates would differ less in greenhouse gas emissions. Differences become smaller still if atmospheric concentrations and global warming is considered. However, differences become larger again if one considers the costs of meeting a certain stabilisation target, as the gap between baseline and target is more sensitive to the exchange rate used than the baseline itself. Differences also grow larger if one looks at climate change impacts, which are determined not just by climate change but also by development. The sensitivity to the exchange rate is purely due to imperfect data, imperfect statistical analysis of data, a crude spatial resolution, and imperfect models. © Springer 2006.",,"Atmospheric composition; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Project management; Purchasing; Statistical methods; Exchange rate; Income effect; Per capita incomes; Climate change; climate change; data acquisition; emission; exchange rate; global warming; greenhouse effect; international comparison",,,,,,"Barro, R.J., Sala-i-Martin, X., (1995) Economic Growth, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Batjes, J.J., Goldewijk, C.G.M., (1994) The IMAGE 2 Hundred Year (1890-1990) Database of the Global Environment (HYDE), , RIVM, Bilthoven, 410100082; Bruce, J.P., Impact of climate change (1995) Nature, 377, p. 472; Bruce, J.P., Purpose and function of IPCC (1996) Nature, 379, pp. 108-109; Castles, I., Climate work based on unsound economics (2004) Australian Financial Review, , Feb 7th; Castles, I., Henderson, D., The IPCC emission scenarios: An economic-statistical critique (2003) Energy and Environment, 14 (2-3), pp. 159-185; Castles, I., Henderson, D., Economics, emission scenarios and the work of the IPCC (2003) Energy and Environment, 14 (4), pp. 415-435; Cline, W.R., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C; Courtney, R.S., Purpose and function of IPCC (1996) Nature, 379, p. 109; Dixon, P.B., Rimmer, M.T., (2004) The Convergence Hypothesis in the Context of Multi-Country Computable General Equilibrium Modelling, , Report to the Department of Treasury and the Australian Greenhouse Office, Centre of Policy Studies, Monash University; (2003) Hot Potato.
