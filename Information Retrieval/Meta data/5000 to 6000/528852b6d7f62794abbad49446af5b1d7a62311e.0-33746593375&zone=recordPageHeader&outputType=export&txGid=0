This DI-BSCCO wire has almost the same mechanical properties as that of the copper wire while it can load a hundred times current. One of the applications of the HTS coils is the motor for the ship propulsion system. It reduces carbon dioxide emissions and contributes the anti-global warming action. Other application is the high-field magnets for the R&D activities. Fabrication of coils for these applications was carried out without difficulties thanks to its improved mechanical properties. The test results show the effectiveness of the DI-BSCCO wire. © 2006 IEEE.","High-temperature superconductors; Magnets; Motors; Superconducting coils","Carbon dioxide; Copper; Electric loads; High temperature superconductors; Magnets; Mechanical properties; Research and development management; Ship propulsion; Anti-global warming; Carbon dioxide emission; Copper wire; Superconducting coils; Superconducting wire",,,,,,"Kalsi, S., Development status of rotating machines employing super-conducting field windings (2004) Proc.
