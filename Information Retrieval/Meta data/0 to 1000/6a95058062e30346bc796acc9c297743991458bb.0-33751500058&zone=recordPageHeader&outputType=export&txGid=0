The UV absorption cross sections for HCFC-141b between 190 and 230 nm were also measured as functions of temperature. These kinetics and cross-section data are compared with results from previous studies. These data were incorporated into a one-dimensional photochemical transport model to estimate the tropospheric and atmospheric lifetimes needed to assess the ozone depletion potential and the global warming potential of these substitutes. The atmospheric lifetime of CH3CFCl2 (HCFC-141b) is approximately 50% longer than the previously accepted value. © 1991 American Chemical Society.",,,,,,,,,"Ravishankara, A.R.; NOAA, Aeronomy Laboratory, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80303, United States",,,,,,,,00223654,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751500058
