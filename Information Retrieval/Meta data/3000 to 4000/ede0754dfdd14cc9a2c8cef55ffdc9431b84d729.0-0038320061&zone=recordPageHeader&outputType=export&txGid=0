California, Colorado and Nebraska censuses exhibit a strong positive correlation with the strong El Niño events of 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 and the weaker event of 1991-1992. Regression analysis shows the population fluctuations are strongly coupled to climate variations on both short (El Niño) and longer (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) time scales. Recognizing the sensitivity to these time scales is important for predicting longer-term global climate change effects.","Butterfly; Climate; El Niño; PDO; Population; Vanessa cardui","butterfly; El Nino-Southern Oscillation;
