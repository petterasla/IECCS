The GHG accounting was done by distinguishing between direct contributions at the AD facility and indirect upstream or downstream contributions. GHG accounting for a generic AD facility with either biogas utilization at the facility or upgrading of the gas for vehicle fuel resulted in a GWF from -375 (a saving) to 111 (a load) kg CO2-eq. tonne-1 wet waste. In both cases the digestate was used for fertilizer substitution. This large range was a result of the variation found for a number of key parameters: energy substitution by biogas, N2O-emission from digestate in soil, fugitive emission of CH4, unburned CH4, carbon bound in soil and fertilizer substitution. GWF for a specific type of AD facility was in the range -95 to -4 kg CO2-eq. tonne-1 wet waste. The ranges of uncertainty, especially of fugitive losses of CH4 and carbon sequestration highly influenced the result. In comparison with the few published GWFs for AD, the range of our data was much larger demonstrating the need to use a consistent and robust approach to GHG accounting and simultaneously accept that some key parameters are highly uncertain.","Anaerobic digestion; Digestate; Global warming; Greenhouse gas accounting; Municipal solid waste","Biogas utilization; Carbon sequestration; Digestate; Fugitive emissions; Key parameters; Municipal Solid Waste; Biogas; Carbon monoxide; Fertilizers; Forestry; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Soils; Solid wastes; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic digestion; biogas; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; methane; nitrogen oxide; biogas; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; municipal solid waste; waste treatment; air pollution; anaerobic digestion; downstream processing; energy conservation; energy consumption; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; municipal solid waste; priority journal; review; soil; uncertainty; waste management; Air Pollutants; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Methane; Refuse Disposal",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"(2004) Final Report.
