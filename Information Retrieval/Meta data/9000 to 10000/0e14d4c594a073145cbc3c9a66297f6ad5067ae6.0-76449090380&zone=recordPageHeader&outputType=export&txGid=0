The resulting methodology utilizes group contribution methods in combination with multi-objective optimization technology for the generation of optimum working fluid candidates. Optimum designs of the corresponding ORC processes are then developed for the comprehensive set of molecules obtained at the CAMD stage, in order to identify working fluids that exhibit optimum performance in ORCs with respect to important economic, operating, safety and environmental indicators. The proposed approach is illustrated with a case study in the design of working fluids for a low-temperature ORC system. Particular attention is paid to safety and environmental characteristics such as flammability, toxicity, ozone depletion and global warming potential. The methodology systematically identified both novel and conventional molecular structures that enable optimum ORC process performance.","Environment; Molecular design; Multi-objective optimization; Organic Rankine Cycle; Working fluids","Computer aided molecular design; Environmental characteristic; Environmental indicators; Global warming potential; Group contribution method; Low temperatures; Molecular design; Optimum designs; Optimum performance; Organic Rankine cycles; Ozone depletion; Process optimization; Process performance; Systematic designs; Working fluid; Design; Global warming; Multiobjective optimization; Occupational risks; Ozone; Ozone layer; Rankine cycle; Structural optimization; Fluids",,,,,,"Hung, T.C., Waste heat recovery of organic rankine cycle using dry fluids (2001) Energy Conservation and Management, 42 (5), p. 539; Tchanche, B.F., Papadakis, G., Lambrinos, G., Frangoudakis, A., Fluid selection for a low-temperature solar organic rankine cycle (2009) Applied Thermal Engineering, 29, p. 2468; Maizza, V., Maizza, A., Unconventional working fluids in organic rankine cycles for waste energy recovery systems (2001) Applied Thermal Engineering, 21 (3), p. 381; Hung, T.C., Shai, T.Y., Wang, S.K., A review of organic rankine cycles (ORCs) for the recovery of low-grade waste heat (1997) Energy, 22 (7), p. 661; Angelino, G., Di Paliano, P.C., Multicomponent working fluids for organic rankine cycles (ORCs) (1998) Energy, 23 (6), p. 449; Yamamoto, T., Furuhata, T., Arai, N., Mori, K., Design and testing of organic rankine cycle (2001) Energy, 26 (3), p. 239; Nguyen, V.M., Doherty, P.S., Riffat, S.B., Development of a prototype low-temperature rankine cycle electricity generation system (2001) Applied Thermal Engineering, 21, p. 169; Spindler, K., Chandwalker, K., Hahne, E., Small solar (thermal) water-pumping system (1996) Solar Energy, 57 (1), p. 69; Liu, B.T., Chien, K.H., Wang, C.C., Effect of working fluids on organic rankine cycle for waste heat recovery (2004) Energy, 29, p. 1207; Andersen, W.C., Bruno, T.J., Rapid screening of fluids for chemical stability in organic rankine cycle applications (2005) Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 44, p. 5560; Mago, P.J., Charma, L.M., Srinivasan, K., Somayaji, C., An examination of regenerative organic rankine cycles using dry fluids (2008) Applied Thermal Engineering, 28, p. 998; Saleh, B., Koglbauer, G., Wendland, M., Fischer, J., Working fluids for low temperature organic rankine cycles (2007) Energy, 32, p. 1210; Drescher, U., Bruggemann, D., fluid selection for the organic rankine cycle (ORC) in biomass power and heat plants (2007) Applied Thermal Engineering, 27, p. 223; Wei, D., Lu, X., Lu, Z., Gu, J., Performance analysis and optimization of organic rankine cycle (ORC) for waste heat recovery (2007) Energy Conversion and Management, 48 (4), p. 1113; Bruno, J.C., Lopez-Villada, J., Letelier, E., Romera, S., Corona, A., Modelling and optimization of solar organic rankine cycle engines for reverse osmosis desalination (2008) Applied Thermal Engineering, 28, p. 2212; Papadopoulos, A.I., Linke, P., Efficient integration of optimal solvent and process design using molecular clustering (2006) Chemical Engineering Science, 61, p. 6316; Papadopoulos, A.I., Linke, P., Integrated solvent and process selection for separation and reactive separation systems (2009) Chemical Engineering and Processing, 48 (5), p. 1047; Churi, N., Achenie, L.E.K., The optimal design of refrigerant mixtures for a two-vaporizer refrigeration system (1997) Computers and Chemical Engineering, 21, pp. S349; Vaidyanathan, R., El-Halwagi, M., Computer-aided design of high performance polymers (1994) Journal of Elastomers and Plastics, 26, p. 277; Venkatasubramanian, V., Chan, K., Caruthers, J.M., Computer aided molecular design using genetic algorithms (1994) Computers and Chemical Engineering, 18 (9), p. 833; Satyanarayana, K., Abildskov, J., Gani, R., Computer-aided polymer design using group contribution plus property models (2009) Computers and Chemical Engineering, 33 (5), p. 1004; Duvedi, A.P., Achenie, L.E.K., Designing environmentally friendly refrigerants using mathematical programming (1996) Chemical Engineering Science, 51, p. 3727; Sahinidis, N.V., Tawarmalani, M., Applications of global optimization to process and molecular design (2000) Computers and Chemical Engineering, 24, p. 2157; Marcoulaki, E.C., Kokossis, A.C., On the development of novel chemicals using a systematic synthesis approach.
