To aid this task we have developed a prototype decision-support tool, called 'ReefState', which integrates the outcomes of management interventions within a 'belief network' of connected variables that describe future warming, coral damage and coral recovery. In a case study applied to the inshore waters of the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia, our worst case scenarios, like several others, suggest that reefs will become devoid of significant coral cover and associated biodiversity by 2050. Even under more optimistic (low) rates of future warming, the persistence of hard coral dominated reefscapes beyond 2050 will be heavily reliant on 2 things, the ability of corals to increase their upper thermal bleaching limits by ∼0.1°C per decade, and management that produces local conditions that constrain excessive algal biomass proliferation during inter-disturbance intervals. Despite being perturbed by a global warming process, management of local ecological factors will thus be of critical importance in shaping the future trajectories of coral reef ecosystems. © Inter-Research 2005.","Adaptation; Belief network; Community composition; Coral bleaching; Decision support; Resilience; Uncertainty","climate change; community composition; coral bleaching; ecosystem resilience; global warming; Australasia; Australia; Coral Sea; Eastern Hemisphere; Great Barrier Reef; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; World; algae; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Stott, P.A., Mitchell, J.F.B., Schnur, R., Delworth, T.L., Quantifying the uncertainty in forecasts of anthropogenic climate change (2000) Nature, 407, pp. 617-620; Baker, A.C., Starger, C.J., McClanahan, T.R., Glynn, P.W., Corals' adaptive response to climate change (2004) Nature, 430, p. 741; Bell, P.R.F., Eutrophication and coral reefs - Some examples in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon (1992) Water Res, 26, pp. 553-568; Bellwood, D.R., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Nyström, M., Confronting the coral reef crisis (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 827-833; Berkelmans, R., Time-integrated thermal bleaching thresholds of reefs and their variation on the Great Barrier Reef (2002) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 229, pp. 73-82; Berkelmans, R., De'ath, G., Kininmonth, S., Skirving, W.J., A comparison of the 1998 and 2002 coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef: Spatial correlation, patterns and predictions (2004) Coral Reefs, 23, pp. 74-83; Borsuk, M.E., Stow, C.A., Reckhow, K.H., A Bayesian network of eutophication models for synthesis, prediction, and uncertainty analysis (2004) Ecol Model, 173, pp. 219-239; Brodie, J., Furnas, M.J., Cyclones, river flood plumes and natural water quality extremes in the central Great Barrier Reef (1996) Downstream Effects of Land Use, pp. 367-374. , Hunter HM, Eyles AG, Rayment GE (eds) Department of Natural Resources, Brisbane; Buddemeier, R.W., Kleypas, J.A., Aronson, R.B., (2004) Coral Reefs and Global Climate Change: Potential Contributions of Climate Change to Stresses on Coral Reef Ecosystems, , Pew Center on Global Climate Change, Arlington, VA; Clarke, J.S., Carpenter, S.R., Barber, M., Collins, S., Ecological forecasts: An emerging imperative (2001) Science, 293, pp. 657-660; Coles, S.L., Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching.
