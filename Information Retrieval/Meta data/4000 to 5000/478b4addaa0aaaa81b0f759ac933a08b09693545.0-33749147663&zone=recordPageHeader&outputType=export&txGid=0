A modeling study of aerosol processing by stratocumulus clouds and its impact on GCM parameterisations of cloud and aerosol. Atmospheric Research, Vol. 50, Nos. 3-4, The Great Dun Fell Experiment, 1995-special issue, 317-344.] was used to examine the sensitivity of the albedo-enhancement global warming mitigation scheme proposed by Latham [Latham, J., 1990. Control of global warming? Nature 347, 339-340; Latham, J., 2002. Amelioration of global warming by controlled enhancement of the albedo and longevity of low-level maritime clouds. Atmos. Sci. Letters (doi:10.1006/Asle.2002.0048).] to the cloud and environmental aerosol characteristics, as well as those of the seawater aerosol of salt-mass ms and number concentration ΔN, which-under the scheme-are advertently introduced into the clouds. Values of albedo-change ΔA and droplet number concentration Nd were calculated for a wide range of values of ms, ΔN, updraught speed W, cloud thickness ΔZ and cloud-base temperature TB: for three measured aerosol spectra, corresponding to ambient air of negligible, moderate and high levels of pollution. Our choices of parameter value ranges were determined by the extent of their applicability to the mitigation scheme, whose current formulation is still somewhat preliminary, thus rendering unwarranted in this study the utilisation of refinements incorporated into other stratocumulus models. In agreement with earlier studies: (1) ΔA was found to be very sensitive to ΔN and (within certain constraints) insensitive to changes in ms, W, ΔZ and TB; (2) ΔA was greatest for clouds formed in pure air and least for highly polluted air. In many situations considered to be within the ambit of the mitigation scheme, the calculated ΔA values exceeded those estimated by earlier workers as being necessary to produce a cooling sufficient to compensate, globally, for the warming resulting from a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Our calculations provide quantitative support for the physical viability of the mitigation scheme and offer new insights into its technological requirements. © 2006.","Albedo; CCN; Climate; Modification","Atmospheric aerosols; Climate change; Climatology; Computational methods; Mathematical models; Computational assessment; General circulation model (GCM); Global warming mitigation; Marine stratocumulus clouds; Clouds; aerosol property; albedo; atmospheric modeling; global warming; numerical model; sensitivity analysis; stratocumulus",,,,,,"Ackerman, A.S., Toon, O.B., Hobbs, P.V., Dissipation of marine stratiform clouds and collapse of the marine boundary layer due to the depletion of cloud condensation nuclei by clouds (1993) Science, 262, pp. 226-229; Albrecht, B.A., Aerosols, cloud microphysics and fractional cloudiness (1989) Science, 245, pp. 1227-1230; Barreras, F., Amaveda, H., Lozano, A., Transient high frequency ultrasonic water atomization (2002) Exp.
