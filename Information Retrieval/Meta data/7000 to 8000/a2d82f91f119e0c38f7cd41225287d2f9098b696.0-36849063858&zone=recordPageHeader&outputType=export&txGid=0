We built species distribution models for Svalbard-nesting pink-footed geese to relate their occurrence to environmental and climatic variables, and used the models to predict their distribution under a warmer climate scenario. The most parsimonious model included mean May temperature, the number of frost-free months and the proportion of moist and wet moss-dominated vegetation in the area. The two climate variables are indicators for whether geese can physiologically fulfil the breeding cycle or not and the moss vegetation is an indicator of suitable feeding conditions. Projections of the distribution to warmer climate scenarios propose a large north- and eastward expansion of the potential breeding range on Svalbard even at modest temperature increases (1 and 2°C increase in summer temperature, respectively). Contrary to recent suggestions regarding future distributions of Arctic wildlife, we predict that warming may lead to a further growth in population size of, at least some, Arctic breeding geese. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Anser brachyrhynchus; Arctic; Biodiversity; Climate change; Climate envelope; Species distribution models; Svalbard","climate change; feeding behavior; population decline; population size; prediction; vegetation; warming; waterfowl; Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Anser; Anser brachyrhynchus; Bryophyta",,,,,,"Abraham, K.F., Jefferies, R.L., Alisauskas, R.T., The dynamics of landscape change and snow geese in mid-continent North America (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 841-855; (2005) Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , ACIA Cambridge University Press, New York; Araújo, M.B., Pearson, R.G., Thuiller, W., Erhard, M., Validation of species-climate impact models under climate change (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 1504-1513; Augustin, N.H., Mugglestone, M.A., Buckland, S.T., An autologistic model for the spatial distribution of wildlife (1996) Journal of Applied Ecology, 33, pp. 339-347; Austin, M.P., Spatial prediction of species distribution: An interface between ecological theory and statistical modelling (2002) Ecological Modelling, 157, pp. 101-118; Boyd, H., Madsen, J., Impacts of global change on arctic-breeding bird populations and migration (1997) Global Change and Arctic Terrestrial Ecosystems, pp. 201-217. , In: (eds Oechel WC, Callaghan T, Gilmanov T, Holten JI, Maxwell B, Molau U, Sveinbjörnsson B), Springer-Verlag, New York; Callaghan, T.V., (2005) Arctic Climate Impact Assessment.
