In this study, we examine 57 New Zealand temperature time series for evidence of non-linearity and changing variability. These correspond to time series for annual minima, annual means and annual maxima for 19 stations. Estimation is by an extended least-squares method. We find a surprising diversity of behaviour of these series - presumably reflecting their different geographic factors as well as series length. We give evidence of regions where temperatures are decreasing. For series where a linear trend is significant, it is downwards in about one third of the cases. This proportion was higher in the South Island, especially for series of minima. Where a non-linear trend is significant, temperatures are decelerating in about one half of the cases. The ratio of downward to upward trends is highest among annual maxima and South Island minima and smallest in annual means. Where a linear trend in the variability is significant, it is decreasing in 13 cases and increasing in 5 cases, although possibly this is partly due to poorer quality data last century. Where a non-linear trend in the variability is significant, variability is decelerating in about two thirds of the cases. The results are used to project upper and lower return levels of minima, means and maxima for each of the series to the year 2010. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Changing variability; Extremes; Temperature; Trends",,,,,,,"Aliani, S., Meloni, R., Dando, P.R., Periodicities in sediment temperature time-series at a marine shallow water hydrothermal vent in Milos Island (Aegean Volcanic arc, Eastern Mediterranean) (2004) Journal of Marine Systems, 46, pp. 109-119; Bodri, L., Cermak, V., Multifractal analysis of temperature time series: Data from boreholes in Kamchatka (2005) Fractals - Complex Geometry Patterns and Scaling in Nature and Society, 13, pp. 299-310; Borges, R., Hernandez-Guerra, A., Nykjaer, L., Analysis of sea surface temperature time series of the south-eastern North Atlantic (2004) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 25, pp. 869-891; Buishand, T.A., Brandsma, T., Multisite simulation of daily precipitation and temperature in the Rhine basin by nearest-neighbor resampling (2001) Water Resources Research, 37, pp. 2761-2776; Derksen, C., Walker, A.E., Identification of systematic bias in the cross-platform (SMMR and SSM/I) EASE-grid brightness temperature time series (2003) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 41, pp. 910-915; Feidas, H., Makrogiannis, T., Bora-Senta, E., Trend analysis of air temperature time series in Greece and their relationship with circulation using surface and satellite data: 1955-2001 (2004) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 79, pp. 185-208; Feng, G.L., Hou, W., Dong, W.J., A technique for distinguishing dynamical species in the temperature time series of Yangtze River delta (2006) Acta Physica Sinica, 55, pp. 962-968; Hessell, J.W.D., The use of long time series climatological observations to determine climatic trends (1979) New Zealand Geographer, 35, pp. 80-82; Hessell, J.W.D., Apparent trends of mean temperature in New Zealand since 1930 (1980) New Zealand Journal of Science, 23, pp. 1-9; Holzbecher, E., Inversion of temperature time series from near-surface porous sediments (2005) Journal of Geophysics and Engineering, 2, pp. 343-348; Hou, W., Feng, G.L., Dong, W.J., Li, J.P., A technique for distinguishing dynamical species in the temperature time series of north China (2006) Acta Physica Sinica, 55, pp. 2663-2668; Houghton, J.T., (1996) Climate Change 1995 - The Science of Climate Change.
