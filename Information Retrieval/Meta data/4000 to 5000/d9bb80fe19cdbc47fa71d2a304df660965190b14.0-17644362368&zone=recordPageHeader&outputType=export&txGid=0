The asymptotic distribution may no longer be normal, if the error is in the form of a long-memory linear process passing through certain nonlinear transformations. However, one hardly has sufficient information about the transformation to determine which type of limiting distribution the OLSE converges to and to apply the correct distribution so as to construct valid confidence intervals for the coefficients based on the OLSE. The present paper proposes a modified least squares estimator to bypass this drawback. It is shown that the asymptotic normality can be assured for the modified estimator with mild trade-off of efficiency even when the error is nonlinear and the original limit for the OLSE is non-normal. The estimator performs fairly well when applied to various simulated series and two temperature data sets concerning global warming. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Asymptotic normality; Long memory; Ordinary least squares; Polynomial trend",,,,,,,"Anderson, T.W., (1971) The Statistical Analysis of Time Series, , New York: Wiley; Avram, F., Taqqu, M.S., Generalized powers of strongly dependent random variables (1987) Annals of Probability, 15, pp. 767-775; Beran, J., (1994) Statistical Methods for Long-memory Processes, , New York: Chapman and Hall; Brockwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., (1987) Time Series: Theory and Methods, , New York: Springer; Dahlhaus, R., Efficient location and regression estimation for long range dependence regression models (1995) Annals of Statistics, 23, pp. 1029-1047; Davydov, Y.A., The invariance principle for stationary processes (1970) Theory of Probability and Its Applications, 15, pp. 487-498; Deo, R.S., Asymptotic theory for certain regression model with long memory errors (1997) Journal of Time Series Analysis, 18, pp. 385-393; Hurvich, C., Linear trend with fractionally integrated errors (1998) Journal of Time Series Analysis, 19, pp. 379-397; Giraitis, L., Koul, H.L., Surgailis, D., Asymptotic normality of regression estimators with long memory errors (1996) Statistics and Probability Letters, 29, pp. 317-335; Grenander, U., On estimation of regression coefficients in the case of an autocorrelated disturbance (1954) Ann.
