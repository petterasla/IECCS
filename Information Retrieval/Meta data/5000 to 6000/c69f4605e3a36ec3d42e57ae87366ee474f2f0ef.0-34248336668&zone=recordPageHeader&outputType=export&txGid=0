One of the more important opportunities is to guide urbanization along pathways that begin to uncouple these gains in well-being from rising levels of energy use. Increasing energy use for transport, construction, climate control in houses and offices, and industrial processes is often accompanied by increasing levels of atmospheric emissions that impact human health, ecosystem functions, and the climate system. Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry alter carbon stocks and fluxes as carbon dioxide, methane, and black carbon. In this article we explore how carbon management could be integrated into the development strategies of cities and urbanizing regions. In particular, we explore how changes in urban form, functions, and roles might alter the timing, aggregation, spatial distribution, and composition of carbon emissions. Our emphasis is on identifying system linkages and points of leverage. The study draws primarily on emission inventories and regional development histories carried out in the regions around the cities of Manila, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New Delhi, and Chiang Mai. We find that how urban functions, such as mobility, shelter, and food, are provided has major implications for carbon emissions, and that each function is influenced by urban form and role in distinct ways. Our case studies highlight the need for major ""U-turns"" in urban policy. © 2007 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.","Carbon emissions; Climate change; Co-benefits; Global warming; Industrial ecology; Sustainable cities","Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Public utilities; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Atmospheric emissions; Carbon management; Carbon stocks; Industrial ecology; Sustainable cities; Urban function; Urbanization; Regional planning; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; developing world; development strategy; emission inventory; energy use; integrated approach; pollution effect; urban pollution; urbanization; Asia; Chiang Mai; Delhi; Eurasia; Ho Chi Minh City; India; Indonesia; Jakarta; Manila; National Capital; New Delhi; Northern Region [Thailand]; Philippines; South Asia; Southeast Asia; Thailand; Viet Nam; Animalia",,,,,,"Ajero, M.A., Emission patterns of Metro Manila (2003) International Workshop on Policy Integration towards Sustainable Energy Use for Cities in Asia, , Paper presented at, 4-5 February, East-West Center, Honolulu, HI; (2000) Asia's clean revolution, , Angel, D.
