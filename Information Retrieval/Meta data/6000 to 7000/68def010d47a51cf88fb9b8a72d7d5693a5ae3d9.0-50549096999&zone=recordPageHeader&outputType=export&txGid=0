Seasonal variations in wind, rainfall, and temperature associated with the Asian monsoon systems affect a vast expanse of tropical and subtropical Asia. Speleothem-derived summer monsoon variation in East Asia was previously found to be closely associated with millennial-scale change in temperature in the North Atlantic region between 75 and 10 ka. New evidence recovered from East Asia, however, suggests that the teleconnection between summer monsoon in East Asia and temperature change in the North Atlantic region may have significantly reduced during 120 to ~ 110 ka, a period directly after the full last interglaciation and corresponding roughly to marine oxygen isotope stage 5d. This reduction may be due to the low ice volume in the North Hemisphere at that time, which makes the millennial-scale change in temperature in the North Atlantic region less effective in influencing the Asian summer monsoon. This is important for investigating the mechanisms controlling the Asian summer monsoon and the paleoclimatic teleconnection between East Asia and the North Atlantic region, and for predicting monsoon-associated precipitation in East Asia under a global-warming trend. © 2008 University of Washington.","Asian monsoon; Decoupling; Marine oxygen isotope stage 5d; Millennial-scale event; North Atlantic; Paleoclimate; Stalagmite; Teleconnection","global warming; Last Interglacial; marine isotope stage; monsoon; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; proxy climate record; rainfall; seasonal variation; speleothem; stalagmite; teleconnection; trend analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",,,,,,"Barnett, T.P., Dümenil, L., Schlese, U., Roeckner, E., Latif, M., The effect of Eurasian snow cover on regional and global climate variations (1989) J.
