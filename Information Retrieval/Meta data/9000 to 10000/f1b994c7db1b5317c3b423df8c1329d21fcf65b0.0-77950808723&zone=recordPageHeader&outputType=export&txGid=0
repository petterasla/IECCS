Reducing carbon dioxide emission and enhancing energy use is a common subject in steel industry. In the integrated steel plant, decreasing carbon dioxide emission must consider energy balance in the whole iron and steel works, and secondary energy must be actively utilized. As promising blast-furnaces, top gas recovery blast furnace (TGR-BF) and oxygen blast furnace have been investigated. In this paper, conceptual TGR blast furnace and oxygen blast furnace are proposed. Base on the idea of blast furnace gas de-CO2 circulating as reducing agent and the idea of pure oxygen blast decreasing the thermal reserve zone temperature, process modeling is conducted with ASPEN Plus. It is shown that the developed model reasonably describes the energy balance and mass balance feature of the furnace, and provides basic thermodynamic condition for furnaces. The effects of changes in different operation conditions are studied by sensitivity analysis and reference data from simulation. © 2010 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","CO2 emission decreasing; Simulation analysis; TGR blast-furnace; Thermal behavior","ASPEN PLUS; Blast furnace gas; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon-based fuels; CO<sub>2</sub> emission decreasing; Developed model; Energy use; Extreme weather; Gas recovery; Iron and steel works; Mass balance; Operation conditions; Process Modeling; Pure oxygen; Reference data; Simulation analysis; Steel industry; Steel plant; Thermal behaviors; Thermal reserve zones; Thermodynamic conditions; Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Coke fueled furnaces; Conceptual design; Electric grounding; Energy balance; Gas burners; Global warming; Iron; Iron and steel plants; Metal analysis; Metal recovery; Metal refineries; Metallurgical furnaces; Oxygen; Sensitivity analysis; Steelmaking; Furnaces",,,,,,"Wang, H., (2001) Iron and Steel Generality (In Chinese), , Metallurgical Industry Press Beijing; Ozawa, L., Sheinbaum, C., Martin, N., Worrell, E., Price, L., Energy use and CO2 emissions in Mexico's iron and steel industry (2002) Energy, 27 (3), pp. 225-239. , DOI 10.1016/S0360-5442(01)00082-2, PII S0360544201000822; Price, L., Sinton, J., Worrell, E., Phylipsen, D., Xiulian, H., Ji, L., Energy use and carbon dioxide emissions from steel production in China (2002) Energy, 27 (5), pp. 429-446. , DOI 10.1016/S0360-5442(01)00095-0; Ariyama, T., Sato, M., Optimization of ironmaking process for reducing CO2 emissions in the integrated steel works (2006) ISIJ International, 46 (12), pp. 1736-1744. , DOI 10.2355/isijinternational.46.1736; Larsson, M., Sandberg, P., Analyzing the influence of variations when optimizing the energy and material system for an integrated steel plant (2003) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Fluid and Thermal Energy Conversion, , December 7-11, Bali, Indonesia; (2001) Aspen Tech.
