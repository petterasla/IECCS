In this work, Australian sugarcane production was assessed more comprehensively in order to generate a robust set of LCA results for use in subsequent assessments of sugarcane products and also to investigate: (1) variability due to regional differences, (2) factors influencing variability, and (3) significance of the impacts. Methods: An average scenario for Australian sugarcane production was modeled based on data for the state of Queensland (98% of Australian production). Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results were generated using Impact 2002+, modified to be more representative of Australian conditions, and with the inclusion of water use and land use indicators. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis, using minimum and maximum values for production data, was undertaken to evaluate variability. Different regional production practices were also modeled to identify factors that influence variability. Normalization aimed to show the significance of total Australian sugarcane production relative to total Australian impacts. Results and discussion: Considerable variability was found in the LCIA results, with the key variables being yield, N use efficiency, the susceptibility of soils to N leakage, irrigation (water and energy intensity), and pre-harvest burning. N leakage was found to be an important issue that influences a range of impact categories. When normalized against total national impacts, water use and land use appear to be the most significant impacts (based on simple indicators of consumption), followed by eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and respiratory impacts, whereas non-renewable energy input and global warming are less significant. The results suggest that toxicity impacts are insignificant; however, this may not be supported by other observations that link pesticide loss from sugarcane to toxicity concerns in receiving waters and is a subject for further research. Conclusions and recommendations: The potential for significant variability in the impacts from sugarcane growing suggests a need for LCAs of sugarcane systems to consider ranges for key variables. The key variables and significant impacts identified in this work can guide data collection priorities for future assessment of sugarcane and possibly other Australian cropping systems. To further develop LCA as a useful predictive tool for Australian agricultural systems, further development and testing of impact assessment models for eutrophication, toxicity, and land and water resource depletion appropriate for Australia and its subregions will be required. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Agriculture; Crop; Environmental impact; Nitrogen; Saccharum officinarum; Sugarcane growing; Sugarcane production; Variability","acidification; article; Australia; clinical assessment tool; controlled study; crop production; ecotoxicity; energy consumption; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; irrigation (agriculture); land use; life cycle assessment; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; soil pollution; species cultivation; sugarcane; Saccharum officinarum",,,,,,"(2006) Australian Sugar Year Book 2006, , Rural Brisbane; Audsley, E., Alber, S., Clift, R., (1994) Harmonisation of Environmental Life Cycle Assessment for Agriculture, , European Union Brussels; Bloesch, P.M., Rayment, G.E., Pulsford, J.S., Regional total phosphorus budgets for sugar production in Queensland (1997) Proc Aust Soc Sugarcane Technol, 19, pp. 213-220; Botha, T., Von Blottnitz, H., A comparison of the environmental benefits of bagasse-derived electricity and fuel ethanol on a life-cycle basis (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (17), pp. 2654-2661. , DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2004.12.017, PII S0301421505000066; Brodie, J., Binney, J., Fabricius, K., (2008) Synthesis of Evidence to Support the Scientific Consusnsus Statement on Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef Reef Water Quality Protection Plan Secretariate, , State of Queensland Brisbane; Browning, J., (2007) Queensland Sugar Cane Railways Today, , http://www.lrrsa.org.au/LRR_SGRz.htm, Retrieved 28/2/2010; (2004) Independent Environmental Audit of the Sugar Industry in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia.
