It was assumed that seven world regions, as players, participate in the permits trading system under the condition of the emission reduction target presented at COP3 and so on. The nucleolus of the grand coalition games as well as the computational results of primary energy supplies and CO2 shadow prices were shown.",,"Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Optimization; Particulate emissions; Carbon emission permits trading; Global energy model; Game theory",,,,,,"Sugiyama, T., (1997) What Had Been Decided at COP3?, , Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, No. Y97902, in Japanese; Mullins, F., Baron, R., International GHG emission trading (1997) OECD, Annex I Expert Group on UN FCCC - Policies and Measures for Common Action, Working Paper, 9; Fujii, Y., Kaya, Y., Assessment of technology options for reducing CO2 emissions from man's global energy system (1993) Trans IEE Jpn, 113 B, pp. 1213-1222. , in Japanese; Yamaji, K., Fujii, Y., Global energy strategy (1995) Denryoku-Shinpou-Sha, , in Japanese; Pepper, W., (1992) Emission Scenarios for the IPCC, An Update, Assumptions, Methodology, and Results, , Prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Working Group I; Ueda, K., Oka, T., Arasawa, H., Economics for environmental policy (1997) Nihon-hyoron-sha, , in Japanese; Suzuki, M., New game theory (1994) Keisou-Shobou, , in Japanese; (1997) EDMC/Survey for Energy and Economics Statistics (1997), , The Energy Conservation Center, Japan; (in Japanese); Satoh, K., Yamaji, K., Akimoto, K., Fujii, Y., Assessment for tradable CO2 emission permits with new earth 21 model (1996) Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Energy System and Economics, pp. 411-416. , Tokyo, (in Japanese); Akimoto, K., Fujii, Y., Sekiguchi, T., A study on joint implementation of CO2 reduction in the global energy system on basis of game theory (1997) Proceedings of Conference of IEE Japan, , Osaka","Akimoto, Keigo; Yokohama Natl UnivJapan",,,"Scripta Technica Inc, New York, NY, United States",,,,,04247760,,EENJA,,"English","Electr Eng Jpn",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033874916
