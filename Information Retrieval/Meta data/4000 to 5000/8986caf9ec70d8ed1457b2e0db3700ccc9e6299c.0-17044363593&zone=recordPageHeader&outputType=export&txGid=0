Early life stages of marine organisms, particularly eggs and larvae, are considered most vulnerable to environmental extremes. Here, we exposed encapsulated embryos of three common rocky shore gastropods to simultaneous combinations of ecologically realistic levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), water temperature stress and salinity stress to identify potential interactions and associated impacts of climate change. We detected synergistic effects with increases in mortality and retardation in development associated with the most physiologically stressful conditions. The effects of UVR were particularly marked, with mortality increasing up to 12-fold under stressful conditions. Importantly, the complex outcomes observed on applying multiple stressors could not have been predicted from examining environmental variables in isolation. Hence, we are probably dramatically underestimating the ecological impacts of climate change by failing to consider the complex interplay of combinations of environmental variables with organisms. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Egg mass; Global climate change; Intertidal; Invertebrate development; Mollusc; Salinity; Synergistic effects; Temperature; UVR","climate change; environmental stress; mollusc; rocky shore; salinity; synergism; ultraviolet radiation; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Mollusca",,,,,,"Adams, N.L., Shick, J.M., Mycosporine-like amino acids prevent UVB-induced abnormalities during early development of the green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (2001) Marine Biology, 138, pp. 267-280; Altamirano, M., Flores-Moya, A., Figueroa, F., Effects of UV radiation and temperature on growth of germlings of three species of Fucus (Phaeophyceae) (2003) Aquatic Botany, 75, pp. 9-20; Andrady, A., Aucamp, P.J., Bais, A.F., Environmental effects of ozone depletion and its interactions with climate change: Progress report 2003 (2004) Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences, 3, pp. 1-5; Barry, J.P., Baxter, C.H., Sagarin, R.D., Climate-related, long-term faunal changes in a California rocky intertidal community (1995) Science, 267, pp. 672-675; Benkendorff, K., Davis, A.R., Gastropod egg mass deposition on a temperate, wave-exposed coastline in New South Wales, Australia: Implications for intertidal conservation (2004) Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems, 14, pp. 263-280; Biermann, C., Schinner, G., Strathmann, R., Influence of solar radiation, microalgal fouling, and current on deposition site and survival of embryos of a dorid nudibranch gastropod (1992) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 86, pp. 205-215; Bjorn, L.O., Ultraviolet radiation, the ozone layer and ozone depletion (1999) Stratospheric Ozone Depletion: The Effects of Enhanced UV-B Radiation on Terrestrial Ecosystems, pp. 21-37. , (ed.
