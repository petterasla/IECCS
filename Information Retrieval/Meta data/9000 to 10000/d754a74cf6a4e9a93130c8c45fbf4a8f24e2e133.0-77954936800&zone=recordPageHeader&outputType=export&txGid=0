Therefore, the usage of renewable energy sources is gaining importance for sustainable energy development and environmental protection. Turkey is one of the developing countries whose demand of electricity is sharply increasing. In order to meet this demand by means of renewable sources, solar power is a suitable source due to the high solar energy potential of Turkey among the renewable sources. In this article, the multi-criteria axiomatic design (AD) approach is proposed for the evaluation of sites for a grid-connected photovoltaic power plant (GCPP) in Turkey. For this aim, four evaluation criteria, which have great influence on determination of a GCPP site are taken into account.
