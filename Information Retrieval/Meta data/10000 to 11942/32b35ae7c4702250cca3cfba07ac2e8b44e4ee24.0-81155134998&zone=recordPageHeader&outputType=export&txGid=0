The prospect of global warming and the urgent need to reduce atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has prompted actions at many levels. The conventional capture of carbon dioxide is predominantly based on chemical absorption using ethanolamine. Recent developments of carbon dioxide capture focus on new materials, such as ionic liquids, zeolites, membranes, carbonaceous absorbents, and metal-organic frameworks. However, no unique solution exists currently to solve the problem of carbon dioxide capture. In order to examine the efficiency of 2-chloroethylamine as an absorbent of CO2, we treated an aqueous solution of 2-chloroethylamine hydrochloride with CO2 in the presence of an alkali, e. g., NaOH, under ambient conditions. The absorption was complete within 30 min, seemingly following first-order reaction kinetics. Furthermore, we succeeded in capturing CO2 from ambient air using 2-chloroethanolamine. The efficiency of 2-chloroethylamine as an absorbent of CO2 could be attributed to the production of stable 2-oxazolidinone, therefore, this reaction is favored thermodynamically. Compared with previously reported absorbents, this novel system is capable of capturing CO2 with an extremely high efficiency of 1 mol per mol absorbent under ambient conditions, even from the atmosphere. This potential method could be used to capture CO2 particularly from small, mobile, or low-concentration emission sources. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","2-chloroethylamine; 2-oxazolidinone; Capture; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,,"Anthony, M.L., Holmes, E., McDowell, P.C.R., Gray, T.J.B., Blackmore, M., Nicholson, J.K., 1H NMR spectroscopic studies on the reactions of haloalkylamines with bicarbonate ions: formation of N-carbamates and 2-oxazolidones in cell culture media and blood plasma (1995) Chem Res Toxicol, 8, pp. 1046-1053; Baker, R.W., Lokhandwala, K., Natural gas processing with membranes: an overview (2008) Ind Eng Chem Res, 47, pp. 2109-2121; Banerjee, R., Phan, A., Wang, B., Knobler, C., Furukawa, H., Keeffe, M.O., Yaghi, O.M., High-throughput synthesis of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks and application to CO2 capture (2008) Science, 319, pp. 939-943; Blanchard, L.A., Hancu, D., Beckman, E.J., Brennecke, J.F., Green processing using ionic liquids and CO2 (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 28-29; Choi, S., Drese, J.H., Jones, C.W., Adsorbent materials for carbon dioxide capture from large anthropogenic point sources (2009) ChemSusChem, 2, pp. 796-854; D'Alessandro, D.M., Smit, B., Long, J.R., Carbon dioxide capture: prospects for new materials (2010) Angew Chem Int Ed, 49, pp. 6058-6082; Ebner, A.D., Ritter, J.A., State-of-the-art adsorption and membrane separation processes for carbon dioxide production from carbon dioxide emitting industries (2009) Sep Sci Technol, 44, pp. 1273-1421; Keith, D.W., Why capture CO2 from the atmosphere (2009) Science, 325, pp. 1654-1655; Krishna, R., van Baten, J.M., In silico screening of zeolite membranes for CO2 capture (2010) J Membr Sci, 360, pp. 323-333; Lee, J.S., Wang, X.Q., Luo, H.M., Baker, G.A., Dai, S., Facile ionothermal synthesis of microporous and mesoporous carbons from task specific ionic liquids (2009) J Am Chem Soc, 131, pp. 4596-4597; Li, J.R., Kuppler, R.J., Zhou, H.C., Selective gas adsorption and separation in metal-organic frameworks (2009) Chem Soc Rev, 38, pp. 1477-1504; Metz, B., Davidson, O., de Coninck, H., Loos, M., Meyer, L., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2005) Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, , http://www.ipcc.ch, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Morris, R.E., Wheatley, P.S., Gas storage in nanoporous materials (2008) Angew Chem Int Ed, 47, pp. 4966-4981; Phan, A., Doonan, C.J., Uribe-Romo, F.J., Knobler, C.B., Keeffe, M.O., Yaghi, O.M., Synthesis, structure, and carbon dioxide capture properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (2010) Acc Chem Res, 43, pp. 58-67; Radosz, M., Hu, X., Krutkramelis, K., Shen, Y., Flue-gas carbon capture on carbonaceous sorbents: toward a low-cost multifunctional carbon filter for ""green"" energy producers (2008) Ind Eng Chem Res, 47, pp. 3783-3794; Rochelle, G.T., Amine scrubbing for CO2 capture (2009) Science, 325, pp. 1652-1654; Stern, N., (2006) Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Trachtenberg, M.C., Cowan, R.M., Smith, D.A., (2007) Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Conference on Carbon Capture Sequestration, , Pittsburgh; Wang, C., Luo, H., Jiang, D., Li, H., Dai, S., Carbon dioxide capture by superbase-derived protic ionic liquids (2010) Angew Chem Int Ed, 49, pp. 5978-5981","Wang, J.; Institute of Marine Material Science and Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China; email: chemwoods@yahoo.com.cn",,,,,,,,16103653,,,,"English","Environ.
