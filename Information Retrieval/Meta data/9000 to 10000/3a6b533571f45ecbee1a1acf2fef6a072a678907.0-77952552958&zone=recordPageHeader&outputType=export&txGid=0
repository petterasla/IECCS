Among these actions, chloride ingress leads to corrosion and has been recognized as a critical factor reducing service life of RC structures. This paper presents a stochastic approach to study the influence of weather conditions and global warming on chloride ingress into concrete. The assessment of chloride ingress is carried out on the basis of a comprehensive model that couples the effects of convection, chloride binding, concrete aging, temperature and humidity. A simplified model of temperature and humidity including seasonal variations and global warming is also proposed in this work. Three scenarios of global warming are defined based on: gas emissions, global population growth, introduction of new and clean technologies and use of fossil sources of energy. The proposed approach is illustrated by a numerical example where the preliminary results indicate that climate changes may yield to significant lifetime reductions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Chloride ingress; Corrosion; Global warming; Reinforced concrete; Reliability; Stochastic modeling","Chloride binding; Chloride ingress; Clean technologies; Comprehensive model; Critical factors; Environmental action; Fossil sources; Global population; Lifetime reduction; Numerical example; RC structure; Reinforced concrete structures; Seasonal variation; Simplified models; Stochastic approach; Stochastic modeling; Weather conditions; Concrete buildings; Corrosion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Leakage (fluid); Moisture; Reinforced concrete; Stochastic systems; Chlorine compounds",,,,,,"Husni, R., (2003), pp. 39-108. , Et al.
