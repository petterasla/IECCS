Experiments were conducted at ambient and twice ambient atmospheric CO2 concentrations at five temperatures. The 1995 temperature in Mississippi was used as a reference with the other temperatures being 1995 minus 2°C, and 1995 plus 2, 5 and 7°C. Daily and seasonal variation and amplitudes were maintained. Seedlings had 4-6 times as much leaf area and dry weight at 20 d after emergence when grown at 28°C as at 23°C (1995 ambient) average temperature during that growth period. Number of days to first square, flower, and open boll decreased as temperature increased. Double atmospheric CO2 did not affect these developmental rates. Temperatures above 28°C, or 1995 average whole-season temperatures, were detrimental to mid- and late-season boll retention and growth. No fruits were retained to maturity at 1995 plus 5 or 7°C. However, whole season vegetative growth was not significantly reduced by temperature 5-7°C above the 1995 ambient conditions. Twice ambient CO2 caused about 40% increase in vegetative dry matter accumulation across temperatures. In a separate experiment, similar results were obtained on fruiting cotton grown at a range of temperatures based on long-term average US Midsouth July temperatures. Therefore, if global warming occurs as predicted, food and fibre production in such high-temperature and humid environments may be more limited to vegetative structures and the animals that consume vegetative structures.",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; climatic change; cotton; growth; yeild; Gossypium hirsutum; Malvaceae",,,,,,"Acock, B., Reddy, V.R., Hodges, H.F., Baker, D.N., McKinion, J.M., Photosynthetic response of soybean canopies to full-season carbon dioxide enrichment (1985) Agronomy Journal, 77, pp. 942-947; Baker, J.T., Allen Jr., L.H., Assessment of the impact of rising carbon dioxide and other potential climate changes on vegetation (1994) Environmental Pollution, 83, pp. 223-235; Baker, J.T., Allen Jr., L.H., Boote, K.J., Growth and yield response of rice to carbon dioxide concentration (1990) Journal of Agricultural Science, 115, pp. 313-320; Conroy, J.P., Seneweera, S., Basra, A.S., Rogers, G., Nissen-Wooler, B., Influence of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperature on growth, yield and grain quality of cereal crops (1994) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 21, pp. 741-758; Gifford, R.M., Interaction of carbon dioxide with growth limiting factors (1992) Advances in Bioclimatology, 1, pp. 24-58; Guinn, G., Hormonal relations during reproduction (1986) Cotton Physiology, pp. 113-136. , (Eds J.
