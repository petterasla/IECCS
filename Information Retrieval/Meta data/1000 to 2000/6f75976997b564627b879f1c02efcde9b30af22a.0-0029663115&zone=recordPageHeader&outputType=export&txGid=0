The diurnal variation in CH4 concentration is predominantly affected by local meteorological conditions as is the case of 222Rn. Positive correlations are recognized between atmospheric CH4 and 222Rn concentrations. From these correlations, the CH4 flux from urban area in Nagoya, Japan, was estimated to be almost constant at 0.02 gCH4m-2d-1 over a year.","Global warming; Radon-222 exhalation rate; Urban methane source","atmospheric flux; methane emission; radon; tracer; urban area; Japan, Honshu, Nagoya; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric composition; Gas emissions; Geographical regions; Global warming; In situ processing; Radioactive tracers; Radon; Scintillation counters; Trace elements; Atmospheric methane; Diurnal variation; Greenhouse effect gases; In situ measurement; Japan; Monitors; Urban area; Methane; methane; radon 222; atmospheric transport; conference paper; greenhouse effect; japan; meteorology; priority journal; urban area",,"methane, 74-82-8; radon 222, 14859-67-7",,,,"Bonsang, B., Lambert, G., Nonmethane hydrocarbons in an oceanic atmosphere (1985) J.
