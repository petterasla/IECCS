We investigated linkages between Lepidoptera, one of the most influential insect taxa in forested ecosystems, and vegetation in riparian areas of conifer-dominated forests of western Oregon, USA. Using model selection techniques, we found that canopy cover explained variability in patterns of moth species dominance and diversity better than all other factors investigated, whereas elevation best explained patterns of moth species richness. Using canonical correspondence analysis, we determined that gradients in shrub species richness, elevation, and understory species richness accounted for the most variation in regional moth community structure. Results suggest that reductions of riparian forest canopy are likely to have the greatest impact on the variety and relative abundance of moths. Due to the relative rarity and patchy distribution of the majority of individual species, we predict that lower intensity vegetation manipulations distributed across larger spatial scales are likely to be less damaging to regional moth biodiversity than more intensive alterations at smaller scales. Finally, if global warming trends continue, upward elevational shifts in moth species distributions will make forested regions at higher elevation worthy of concerted protection. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Biodiversity; Canopy; Elevation; Moth; Species composition; Species diversity; Species richness; Understory","abundance; community response; environmental disturbance; forest canopy; forest ecosystem; global warming; moth; species diversity; species richness; understory; Oregon; United States; Coniferophyta; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera",,,,,,"Axmacher, J.C., Brehm, G., Hemp, A., Tunte, H., Lyaruu, H.V.M., Muller-Hohenstein, K., Fiedler, K., Determinants of diversity in afrotropical herbivorous insects (Lepidoptera: Geometridae): Plant diversity, vegetation structure or abiotic factors?
