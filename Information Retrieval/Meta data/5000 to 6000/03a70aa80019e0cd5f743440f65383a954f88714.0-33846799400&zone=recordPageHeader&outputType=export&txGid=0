In China, high-frequency regions of sandstorms tend to correspond with the spring wheat regions between the end of February and the end of March. During March to May each year, when sandstorms frequently occur, the seedlings of spring wheat are young and susceptible to being uprooted by the winds. There is not enough plant coverage or root depth at this early stage to hold the soil from the fierce winds. As a result, the young plant life is destroyed and leaving the top soil susceptible to being blown about when in the path of high-frequency regions of sandstorms. By contrast, the seeding time of winter wheat is about September-October corresponding to lowest-frequency period of sandstorms. From the end of February to the middle of March, the winter wheat begins to turn green (ahead of 10 day than grass). During March to May when sandstorm frequently occurs, the winter wheat has come into a mature tillering or jointing stage. By then, the leaf area index is 1-4 and height is up to 20-50 cm, by which the loose soil is more compacted and covered with the fledging wheat. The result is that the energy of the air current is gradually dissipated and the wind speed near the ground is greatly weakened. So, without bare uncovered soil being whipped by powerful winds, the resulting sandstorms are greatly mitigated or weakened. After investigating the trend of global warming, the geological history-forming mechanism of sandstorms and their temporal-spatial distributions, and test for the last few years, the result is that by replacing spring wheat with winter wheat in high-frequency sandstorm regions, the damages of sandstorm are greatly reduced. Thus, by significantly increasing the vegetal cover time of ground during the windy season, one can alleviate the hazard index of sandstorms, which is a social, ecological and economic favorable result. © 2006.","Agro-ecosystems; East Asia; Environmental technology; Sandstorm; Sustainable development; Wheat","agricultural economics; agroecology; alternative agriculture; desertification; dust storm; environmental technology; global warming; ground cover; wheat; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"An, Z.S., Kutzbach, J.E., Prell, W.L., Evolution of Asian monsoon and phased uplift of the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau since late Miocene times (2001) Nature, 41, pp. 62-66; Chang, Z., Liu, H., Ji, Y., Investigation and analysis to the latest strong sand-dust storm occurred in Hexi Corridor (1997) Desert Research, 17 (4), pp. 442-446. , (in Chinese); Ding, Z.L., A record of magnetic stratum and grain size from the red-clay and loess in Lingtai (1998) Quaternary Sciences, pp. 86-94; Gu, X., LI, J., YU, L., The evolution of dust storms since last interglacial in Gansu as reconstructed from Loess Record (1999) Acta Geographica Science, 54 (5), pp. 445-453. , (in Chinese); Guo, Z.T., Ruddiman, W.F., Hao, Q.Z., Onset of Asian desertification by 22 Myr ago inferred from loess deposits in China (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 159-163; Lin, Q., Gao, J., Yu, L., (2002) Developmental Economic Theory of Sustainable Agriculture, pp. 47-48. , Environment Science Press, Beijing (in Chinese); Liu, D., (1985) Loess and Environment, , Beijing, Science Press (in Chinese); Merrill, S.D., Black, A.L., Fryrear, D.W., Soil wind erosion hazard of spring wheat-fallow as affected by long-term climate and tillage (1999) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 63, pp. 1768-1777; Ning, Z., Drought in the Sahel (2003) Science, 302, pp. 999-1000; Qiu, X., Zeng, Y., Miao, Q., Temporal-spatial distribution as well as tracks and source areas of sand-dust storms in China (2001) Acta Geographica Science, 56 (3), pp. 316-322. , (in Chinese); Shine, K.P., de, P.M., Forster, F., The effect of human activity on radiative forcing of climate change, a review of recent developments (1999) Global and Planetary Change, 20, p. 205; Sui, Y., Ding, S., A preliminary study on agricultural countermeasures of the climate warming (1997) Economic Geography, 17 (5), pp. 327-330. , (in Chinese); Sun, D.H., An, Z.S., Shaw, J., Magnetostratigraphy and paleoclimatic significance of late tertiary aeolian sequences in the Chinese Loess Plateau (1998) Geophysical Journal International, 134, pp. 207-212; Sun, J., Liu, T., Lei, Z., Sources of heavy dust fall in Beijing, China on April 16, 1998 (2000) Geophysical Research Letters, 27 (14), pp. 2105-2110; Tang, K., He xiubin, Revelation of information ongenesis of multi paleosol from quaternary loess profil (2002) Acta Pedologica Sinica, 39 (5), pp. 609-617. , (in Chinese); (1985) Agriculture and Climate in China, , The writing group of agriculture and climate in China, Science Press, Beijing (in Chinese); Thomas, C.J., Causes of climate change over the past 1000 years (2000) Science, 289, pp. 270-277; Wang, S., Yang, D., Zhou, Y., Analysis on the formative causes of sand-dust storms in the northwest China during 3-12 April 1994 (1995) Desert Research, 15 (4), pp. 332-338. , (in Chinese); Xu, J., Niu, J., Chen, W., Study on sand and dust storm weather in northwest China on April 5, 1994 (1996) Desert Research, 16 (3), pp. 281-286. , (in Chinese); Yuan, H., Zhang, F., Fan, J., Study on northward expansion of the winter wheat production region in Ningxia (1996) Ningxia Journal of Agricultural and Forestry Science, 1, pp. 12-14. , (in Chinese); Zhang, X.Y., Arimoto, R., An, Z.S., Dust emission from Chinese desert sources linked to variations in atmospheric circulation (1997) Journal of Geophysical Research, 102 (D23), pp. 28041-28047; Zhang, R., Han, Z., Wang, M., Dust storm weather in China, new characteristics and origins (in Chinese with English abstract) (2002) Quaternary Sciences, 4 (22), pp. 374-380; Zhou, Z., Zhang, G., The typical strong sandstorm event in northern China (1954-2002) (2003) Science Bulletin, 48 (11), pp. 1224-1228. , (in Chinese)","Yu-Zhu, S.; College of Resource and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, China; email: suiyuzhu@126.com",,,,,,,,09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.
