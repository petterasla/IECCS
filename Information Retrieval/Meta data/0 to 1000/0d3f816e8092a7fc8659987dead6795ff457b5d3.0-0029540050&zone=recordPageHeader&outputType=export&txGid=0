The initial goal of the Arctic Flux Study (a part of NSFs Arctic System Science Program) is a regional estimate of the present and future movement of materials between the land, atmosphere and ocean in the Kuparuk River basin in northern Alaska. Important vertical fluxes under study are the release of CO2 and CH4 from soils and water, lateral fluxes are surface water, nutrients, and organic matter. After the first year of study the regional climate model has been successfully configured to the northern Alaska region. We have also measured a large release of carbon dioxide from tundra soils in all but the coldest and wettest parts of the transect. -from Authors",,"Arctic flux; carbon dioxide; methane; regional climate model; trace gas emission; tundra soil; USA, Alaska, Kuparuk River",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029540050
