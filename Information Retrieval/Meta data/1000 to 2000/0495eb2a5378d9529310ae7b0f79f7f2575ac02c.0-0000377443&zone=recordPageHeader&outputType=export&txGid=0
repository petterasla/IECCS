An estimation showed that about 90% of carbon uptake by agricultural systems would be emitted or returned to the atmosphere by several types from 1990 to 2000, others remain in durable agricultural products and soil. Even though the fixation rate is getting lower, generally speaking Chinese agriculture is a ""sink"" but not a ""source"" in respect to the atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations in both the current period and that after few decades. China's Soil stores 12% of the whole soil carbon in the World. Considering the different global warming potentials (GWP), an approach to the country budgets of CO2 and CH4 has been presented based on the measurements in rice paddies and in the Tibet and Inner Mongolia grasslands. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","C cycle; Global change; Greenhouse gas emission; Soil carbon storage",,,,,,,"(1991) Agricultural Yearbook of China, , Agriculture Press, Beijing, China; Fang, J., Storage of distribution of organic carbon in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems (1996) GHG Concentration, Emission Monitoring and Related Process (in Chinese), pp. 109-128. , Wang Gengchen (eds) Chinese Environmental Science Press; (1982) The Soils of China, , Science Press, Beijing China; (1986) The Soil Atlas of China, , Cartographic Publishing House, Beijing, China; (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, pp. 25-47. , Cambridge University Press, New York; Lin, E., Dong, H., Li, Y., Methane Emissions of China: Agricultural Sources and Mitigation Options (1994) Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases, pp. 405-410. , van Ham J et al.
