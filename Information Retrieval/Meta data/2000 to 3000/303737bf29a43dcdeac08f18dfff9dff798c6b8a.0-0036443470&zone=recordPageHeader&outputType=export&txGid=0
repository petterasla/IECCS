In the high Arctic on Svalbard, grazing by reindeer is a process that can be modelled without plant-to-herbivore feedback, as reindeer population sizes are not correlated with plant growth. However, growing conditions are extreme: a short season and low temperatures inhibit optimal growth. Therefore, it is possible to model anti-herbivore defence in competition in this system, assess how its optimum depends on grazing intensity and defence efficiency, and, finally, how global climate change will effect plant-plant interactions. This model, based on a Lotka-Volterra type competition and temperature-dependent growth, indicates that competition is of considerable importance even in extreme environments. Herbivory mediates displacement of the defended plant by releasing it from competition. This process is more pronounced under high grazing pressure than under low pressure. In other words, competition potentially magnifies the effect of herbivory. Elevated temperatures and a longer growing season have no qualitative impact on these processes, as the dominant defended plant profits most.","Arctic; Climate change; Herbivory; Model; Optimal defence; Reindeer","antiherbivore defense; climate change; competition (ecology); grazing pressure; herbivory; Rangifer tarandus",,,,,,"Aanes, R., Sæther, B.E., Øritsland, N.A., Fluctuations of an introduced population of Svalbard reindeer: The effects of density dependence and climatic variation (2000) Ecography, 23, pp. 437-443; Begon, M., Harper, J.L., Townsend, C.R., (1990) Ecology, , Cambridge: Blackwell; Bryant, J.P., Chapin, F.S., Klein, D.R., Carbon/nutrient balance of boreal plants in relation to vertebrate herbivory (1983) Oikos, 40, pp. 357-368; Chesson, P., Huntly, N., The roles of harsh and fluctuating conditions in the dynamics of ecological communities (1997) American Naturalist, 150, pp. 519-553; Coley, P.D., Bryant, J.P., Chapin, F.S., Resource availability and plant antiherbivore defense (1985) Science, 230, pp. 895-899; De Jong, T.J., Why fast-growing plants do not bother about defense (1995) Oikos, 74, pp. 545-548; Dormann, C.F., Van der Wal, R., Bakker, J.P., Competition and herbivory intensity during salt-marsh succession: The importance of forb growth strategy (2000) Journal of Ecology, 88, pp. 571-583; Dormann, C.F., Facilitation and competition in the high Arctic: The importance of experimental approach (2002) Acta Oecologica, , in press; Dormann, C.F., Skarpe, C., Flowering, growth and defence in the two sexes: Consequences of herbivore exclusion on Salix polaris (2002) Functional Ecology, 16, pp. 649-656; Dormann, C.F., (2001) Global Change, Herbivory and Arctic Plants, , University of Aberdeen: PhD thesis; Feeny, P., Plant apparency and chemical defense (1976) Recent Advances in Phytochemistry, 10, pp. 1-40; Grace, J.B., On the measurement of plant competition intensity (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 305-308; Grime, J.P., (1979) Plant Strategies and Vegetation Processes, , Chichester: John Wiley; Herms, D.A., Mattson, W.J., The dilemma of plants: To grow or defend (1992) The Quarterly Review of Biology, 67, pp. 283-335; Irvine, R.J., Stien, A., Halvorsen, O., Langvatn, R., Albon, S.D., Life-history strategies and population dynamics of abomasal nematodes in Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) (1999) Parasitology, 120, pp. 297-311; Langvatn, R., Albon, S.D., Irvine, R.J., Halvorsen, O., Ropstad, E., Parasitter, kondisjon og reproduksjon hos svalbardrein (1999) Svalbardtundraens Økologi, pp. 139-148. , (Bengtson, S.
