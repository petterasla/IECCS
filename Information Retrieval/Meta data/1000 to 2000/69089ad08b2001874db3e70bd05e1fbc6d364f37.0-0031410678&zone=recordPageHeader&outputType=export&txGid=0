The mitigation options are water management, soil amendments, organic matter management, different tillage, rotation, and cultivar selection. Altering water management, in particular promoting midseason aeration by short-term drainage, is one of the most promising strategies, although these practices may be limited to the rice paddy fields where the irrigation system is well prepared. Improving organic matter management by promoting aerobic degradation through composting or incorporating into soil during off-season drained period is another most promising candidate. There are several formidable obstacles to adopt the mitigation options into local rice farming, including limited applicability to different types of rice fields, increasing cost and labor, negative effects on rice yield and soil fertility, and time requirement for practical application. Further studies to verify the mitigation options should focus on the feasibility for local farmers. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Cultivar selection; Global warming; Organic matter management; Soil amendments; Water management","environmental management; methanogenesis; rice; emission reduction; methane emission; rice paddy; water management",,,,,,"Bronson, K.F., Mosier, A.R., Effect of encapsulated calcium carbide on dinitrogen, nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide emissions from flooded rice (1991) Biol Fertil Soils, 11, pp. 116-120; Cai, Z.C., Xu, H., Zhang, H.H., Jin, J.S., Estimate of methane emission from rice paddy fields in Taihu region, China (1994) Redosphere, 4, pp. 297-306; Chen, Z., Li, L., Shao, K., Wang, B., Features of CH4 emission from rice paddy fields in Beijing and Nanjing (1993) Chemosphere, 26, pp. 239-245; Cicerone, R.J., Oremland, R.S., Biogeochemical aspects of atmospheric methane (1988) Global Biogeochem Cycles, pp. 299-327; Denier Van Der Gon, H.A.C., Neue, H.U., Impact of gypsum application on methane emission from a wetland rice field (1994) Global Biogochem Cycles, 8, pp. 127-134; Hori, K., Inubushi, K., Matsumoto, S., Wada, H., Competition for acetic acid between methane formation and sulfate reduction in the paddy soil (1990) Jpn J Soil Sci Plant Nutr, 61, pp. 572-578. , in Japanese with English summary; (1992) Climate Change 1992, the Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge university press; Kitada, K., Ozaki, Y., Akiyama, Y., Yagi, K., Effects of high content of NO3-N in irrigation water and rice straw application on CH4 emission from paddy fields (1993) Jpn J Soil Sci Plant Nutr, 64, pp. 49-54. , in Japanese with English summary; Knowles, R., Methane: Processes of production and consumption (1993) Agricultural Ecosystem Effects on Trace Gases and Global Climate Change, pp. 45-156. , Harper LA et al.
