Inversions of the temperature profiles in boreholes throughout this large region provide evidence of anomalously high ground surface temperature (GST) warming trends between the mid-19th century and present. Previous studies have identified strong SAT/GST associations throughout this region for the 20th century. This analysis of the composite, century-scale, regional GST histories (GSTHs) is based on the deepest available borehole temperature logs from the Foreland Sedimentary Basin in western and northern Canada, east of the Cordillera. Although separated by almost 20° latitude, there is strong regional correlation (r = 0.98) between the GSTHs developed from northern (boreal forest) and southern (prairie grassland) boreholes. When filtered, the GSTHs of western Canada correlate strongly with the northern hemisphere (r = 0.80) and the Canadian Arctic (r = 0.86) high temporal resolution proxy climate histories. Strong correlation also exists between the prairie grassland GSTH curve and the tree-ring-based surface summer temperature history from the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rocky Mountains close to Athabasca Glacier (r = 0.95). These findings strongly suggest that the similar, but enhanced, SAT warming signal identified by GSTHs makes western interior Canada a strong indicator region of global warming.","Borehole temperature logs; Climate proxy data; Ground surface temperatures; Surface air temperatures; Western canada climate warming","borehole; global warming; surface temperature; temperature profile; Canada",,,,,,"Beach, R.W.W., Jones, F.W., Majorowicz, J.A., Heat flow and heat generation estimated from Churchil basement of the Western Canada Basin, Canada (1987) Geothermics, 16, pp. 1-16; Beltrami, H., Mareschal, J.C., Resolution of ground temperature histories inverted from borehole temperature data (1995) Global Planet Change, 11, pp. 127-138; Beltrami, H., Taylor, A.E., Records of climatic change in the Canadian Arctic: Towards calibrating oxygen isotope data with geothermal data (1995) Global Planet Change, 11, pp. 57-70; Beltrami, H., Jessop, A.M., Mareschal, J.C., Ground temperature histories in Eastern and Central Canada from geothermal measurements; evidence of climatic change (1992) Global Planet Change, 6, pp. 167-184; Beltrami, H., Chapman, D.S., Archambault, S., Bergeron, Y., Reconstruction of high resolution ground temperature histories combining dendrochronological and geothermal data (1995) Earth Planet Sci Lett, 136, pp. 437-445; Briffa, K.R., Annual climate variability in the Holocene: Interpreting the message of ancient trees (2000) Q Sci Rev, 19, pp. 87-105; Campbell, I.D., Campbell, C., Apps, M.J., Rutter, N.W., Bush, A.B., Late Holocene-1500 year climatic periodicities and their implications (1998) Geology, 26 (5), pp. 471-473; Clow, G.D., The extent of temporal smearing in surface temperature histories derived from borehole temperature measurements (1992) Global Planet Change, 98, pp. 81-86; Gosnold, W.D., Todhunter, P.E., Schmidt, W., The borehole temperature record of climate warming in the mid-continent of North America (1997) Global Planet Change, 15, pp. 33-45; Guillou-Frottier, L., Mareshal, J.C., Musset, J., Ground surface temperature history in Central Canada inferred from 10 selected borehole temperature profiles (1998) J Geophys Res, 103, pp. 7385-7397; Harris, R.N., Chapman, D.S., Geothermics and climate change, 1.
