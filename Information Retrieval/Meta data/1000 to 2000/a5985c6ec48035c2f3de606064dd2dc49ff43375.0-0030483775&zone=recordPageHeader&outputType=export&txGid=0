Two district-cooling scenarios are assessed. The first assumes implementation of utility-based cogeneration/absorption chilling to satisfy a minor portion of the cooling demands of the residential-commercial-institutional sector. The other scenario is similar, but assumes a larger portion of the sector cooling demands are satisfied using utility-based cogeneration/absorption chilling. Presented in the assessments are (i) data on fuel-cycle emissions, environmental and health effects, and associated economic costs of the existing Ontario Hydro energy system and (ii) the reductions in emissions, effects and environmental and health costs predicted for each scenario. Effects considered include mortality, morbidity, lost work days, lost crop yield, lost fish yield, building damage, global warming and aquatic thermal effects.",,"Cogeneration plants; Cooling systems; Environmental impact; Health care; Numerical analysis; Optimization; District cooling; District heating; cogeneration; district cooling; economic evaluation; electricity utlity; environmental impact; health benefit; medical geography; Canada, Ontario",,,,,,"Hart, D.R., Rosen, M.A., (1994) Energy and Environment, 5, p. 363; Rosen, M.A., (1994) Energy - The International Journal, 19, p. 1143; Rosen, M.A., Dimitriu, J., Fairey, M., Birstein, M., Investigation of the opportunities for the cogeneration of electrical and thermal energy by Ontario hydro (1993) Report to South Bruce Economic Development Corporation by the Department of Mechanical Engineering, , Ryerson Polytechnical Institute, Toronto; Rosen, M.A., Dimitriu, J., Le, M., Assessment of the potential benefits of utility-based cogeneration for industrial process heating in Ontario, Canada (1995) Advances in Enhanced Heat/Mass Transfer and Energy Efficiency, 1-320, pp. 115-124. , M.
