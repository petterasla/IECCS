Despite effective technologies to reduce such emissions, resistance to more fuel-efficient cars from manufacturers and consumers combined with increased usage means that no progress has been made as yet.","Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions; Company cars; Consumer demand; Engine design; Fuel efficiency; Global warming; Institutional barriers","Automobile engines; Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Machine design; Carbon dioxide emissions; Consumer demand; Engine design; Fuel efficiency; Institutional barriers; Vehicle design; Energy efficiency",,,,,,"Bovy, P.H.L., Orfeuil, J.P., Salomon, I., (1992) A Billion Trips A Day: Mobility Patterns of the Europeans, , European Science Foundation-NECTAR International Symposium, Amsterdam; Cavalini, P.M., Hendrickx, L., Rooijers, A.J., Differences among groups of drivers regarding environmentally relevant behaviour (in Dutch) (1995) Milieu, (1), pp. 18-25; (1992) Green Paper on the Impact of Transport on the Environment, , CEC Brussels; Cornelissen, R.L., (1993) Materialensubstituties Inde Automobiel, , IVEM, Groningen; (1994) National Travel Survey 1991/93, , HMSO, London; (1995) European Energy Forecast, , DRL Paris; Fergusson, M., (1990) Subsidised Pollution: Company Cars and the Greenhouse Effect, , Greenpeace; Flink, J.J., (1990) The Automobile Age, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Hopkin, J.M., The transport implications of company-financed motoring (1986) Transport and Road Research Laboratory Research Report, 61. , Crowthorne; Houghton, J.Y., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, (1990) Climate Change: the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press; Hughes, P., Potter, S., Options for reducing CO 2 emissions from personal travel in Europe (1992) International Journal of Vehicle Design, 13 (2), pp. 114-124; Hughes, P., (1993) Personal Travel and the Greenhouse Effect, , Earthscan, London; (1993) Cars and Climate Change, , OEDC/IEA, Paris; Lovins, A.B., Barnett, J.W., Lovins, L.H., Supercars: The coming light-vehicle revolution (1993) The Energy Efficiency Challenge for Europe, , Ling, R. and Wilhite, H.
