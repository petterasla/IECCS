Early discharges, for example, from market-mediated land use change, will have created more global warming by any time in the future than later discharges, owing to the slow decay of atmospheric CO2. A spreadsheet model of this process, BTIME, captures this important time pattern effect using the Bern CO2 decay model to allow fuels to be compared for policy decisions on the basis of their real warming effects with a variety of user-supplied parameter values. The model also allows economic discounting of climate effects extended far into the future. Compared to approaches that simply sum greenhouse gas emissions over time, recognizing the physics of atmospheric CO2 decay significantly increases the deficit relative to fossil fuel of any biofuel causing land use change. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Atmospheric CO; Climate effects; Decay model; Discharge patterns; Land-use change; Pattern effect; Policy decisions; Spreadsheet modeling; Biofuels",,,,,,"Mila I Canals, L., Bauer, C., Depestele, J., Dubreuil, A., Knuchel, R.F., Gaillard, G., Michelsen, O., Rydgren, B., Key elements in a framework for land use impact assessment within LCA (2007) International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 12 (1), pp. 2-4. , DOI 10.1065/lca2006.12.296; (2008) The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Regulation-draft, , CARB; Proposed regulation to implement the low carbon fuel standard (2009) Staff Report: Initial Statement of Reasons, 2, p. 332; Congress, U.S., (2007) Energy Independence and Security Act; Davidson, E.A., Ackerman, I.L., Changes in soil carbon inventories following cultivation of previously untilled soils (1993) Biogeochemistry, 20 (3), pp. 161-193; Fargione, J., Hill, J., Tilman, D., Polasky, S., Hawthorne, P., Land clearing and the biofuel carbon debt (2008) Science, 319 (5867), pp. 1235-1238; Forster, P., (2007) Climate Change 2007-the Physical Science Basis.
