Models of these systems were constructed using a combination of census data, published values, and the requirements for organic production described in the Canadian National Organic Standards in order to be broadly representative of the similarities and differences that characterize these disparate production technologies. Our results indicate that organic crop production would consume, on average, 39% as much energy and generate 77% of the global warming emissions, 17% of the ozone-depleting emissions, and 96% of the acidifying emissions associated with current national production of these crops. These differences were almost exclusively due to the differences in fertilizers used in conventional and organic farming and were most strongly influenced by the higher cumulative energy demand and emissions associated with producing conventional nitrogen fertilizers compared to the green manure production used for biological nitrogen fixation in organic agriculture. Overall, we estimate that a total transition to organic production of these crops in Canada would reduce national energy consumption by 0.8%, global warming emissions by 0.6%, and acidifying emissions by 1.0% but have a negligible influence on reducing ozone-depleting emissions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Agriculture; Conventional; Efficiency; Green manure; Life cycle assessment; Nitrogen; Organic","Biological nitrogen fixations; Brassica rapa; Canadian nationals; Census datums; Conventional; Crop productions; Cumulative energy demands; Efficiency gains; Energy consumptions; Field crops; Glycine maxes; Green manure; Green manures; Life cycle assessment; Life Cycle assessments; Organic; Organic agricultures; Organic farmings; Organic productions; Potential reductions; Production technologies; Scenario models; Triticum aestivum; Wheat productions; Zea mays; Agriculture; Alternative fuels; Crops; Cultivation; Energy management; Fertilizers; Global warming; Grain (agricultural product); Manures; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen fixation; Ozone; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Life cycle; green manure; nitrogen fertilizer; crop production; dicotyledon; emission control; fertilizer application; global warming; life cycle analysis; manure; nitrogen; organic farming; ozone; soybean; wheat; agriculture; article; Canada; corn; energy consumption; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; maize; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; organic farming; ozone depletion; soybean; theoretical model; turnip; wheat; Agriculture; Brassica rapa; Energy-Generating Resources; Environmental Pollution; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Manure; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Ozone; Soybeans; Triticum; Zea mays; Canada; North America; Brassica napus var. napus; Brassica rapa; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",,"Fertilizers; Manure; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Alexandratos, N., World food and agriculture: Outlook for the medium and longer term (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 96, pp. 5908-5914; Badgley, C., Moghtader, J., Quintero, E., Organic agriculture and the global food supply (2007) Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems, 22, pp. 86-108; Bhat, M., English, B., Turhollow, A., Nyangito, H., (1994) Energy in Synthetic Fertilizers and Pesticides: Revisited.
