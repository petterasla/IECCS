Foraging Yellow-rumped Warblers used tree species in relation to the date that trees initiated bud break and the date caterpillars were most abundant in trees. The first arrival date of Yellowrumped Warblers at the stopover site varied with date of bud break; duration of migration through the stopover site ranged from 31 to 47 days. The earliest Yellow-rumped Warbler migrants observed arrived at the stopover site before appearance of many arthropods, and foraged on the temporarily abundant adult stage of the hackberry psyllid (Pachypsylla spp. Fletcher Homoptera). Later migrants switched to foraging for caterpillars. The proportions of foraging observations among tree species were similar across all 3 years and, each year, tree species used by Yellow-rumped Warblers diversified as spring progressed. Yellow-rumped Warblers are short-distance migrants (most winter in the southern United States); my results indicate these birds may have an advantage over long-distance migrants in view of global climate change as they can arrive early at stopover habitats and exploit resources when they are most available. © 2009 The Wilson Ornithological Society.",,"abundance; arrival date; caterpillar; climate change; food availability; passerine; phenology; stopover; temporal analysis; Illinois; United States; Arthropoda; Aves; Celtis; Dendroica coronata; Hemiptera; Pachypsylla; Psyllidae",,,,,,"Afik, D., Karasov, W.H., The trade-offs between digestion rate and efficiency in warblers and their ecological implications (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 2247-2257; Augspurger, C.K., Bartlett, E.A., Differences in leaf phenology between juvenile and adult trees in a temperate deciduous forest (2003) Tree Physiology, 23, pp. 517-525; Bairlein, F., Huppop, O., Migratory fueling and global climate change (2004) Advances in Ecological Research, 35, pp. 33-47; Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Awmack, C., Bezemer, T.M., Brown, V.K., Butterfield, J., Whittaker, J.B., Herbivory in global climate change research: Direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 1-16; Boggess, W.R., Trelease Woods, Champaign County, Illinois: Woody vegetation and stand composition (1964) Transactions of the Illinois State Academy of Science, 57, pp. 261-271; Both, C., Artemyev, A.V., Blaauw, B., Cowie, R.J., Dekhuijzen, A.J., Eeva, T., Enemar, A., Visser, M.E., Largescale geographical variation confirms that climate change causes birds to lay earlier (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 271, pp. 1657-1662; Bradley, N.L., Leopold, A.C., Ross, J., Huffaker, W., Phenological changes reflect climate change in Wisconsin (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (USA), 96, pp. 9701-9704; Brook, B., Global warming tugs at trophic interactions (2009) Journal of Animal Ecology, 78, pp. 1-3; BBS Canada: A newsletter for cooperators in the Breeding Bird Survey of Canada, winter 2002 (2002) National Wildlife Research Centre, , CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERVICE.
