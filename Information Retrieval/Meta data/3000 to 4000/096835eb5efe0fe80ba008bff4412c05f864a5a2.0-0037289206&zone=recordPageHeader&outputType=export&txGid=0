It is a natural gas formed by geological, or biological, processes in coal seams and generally consists predominantly of methane, but may also contain some higher alkanes and non-combustible gases. Methane is released whenever coal is de-stressed or fractured by mining. Methane is one of the main greenhouse gases contributing to global warming, therfore releasing it to atmosphere is an environmental hazard. However, it is also an important energy resource and can be recovered from operational coal mines, abandoned coal mines, and virgin (unmined) coal seams. Significant volumes of CBM are exploited worldwide for space heating, industrial processes, and power generation. This paper critically reviews the current UK and worldwide status of CBM extraction and utilization technologies building on a previous study funded through the Department of Trade and Industry's Cleaner Coal Technology Programme [1].","Abandoned mine methane; Coal mine methane; Coalbed methane","Coal; Environmental impact; Extraction; Mining; Greenhouse gases; Methane; abandoned mine; cleaner production; coalbed methane; energy resource; extraction; power generation; recovery method",,,,,,"Creedy, D.P., (1999) Coalbed Methane-The RandD Needs of the UK, , Report No. COAL R163, DTI, March; Carbon credits and coal mine methane (2000) Second International Methane Mitigation Conference, 37 (3), pp. 585-590. , World Coal Institute.
