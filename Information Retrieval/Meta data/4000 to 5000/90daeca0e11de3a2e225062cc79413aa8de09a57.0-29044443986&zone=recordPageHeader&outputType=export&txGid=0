Coal seams may make excellent candidates for CO 2 sequestration; coal-seam sequestration could enhance methane production and improve sequestration economics. Reservoir-simulation computations are an important component of any engineering design before carbon dioxide is injected underground. We have performed such simulations for a hypothetical pilot-scale project in representative coal seams. In these simulations we assume four horizontal production wells that form a square, that is, two wells drilled at right angles to each other forming two sides of a square, with another pair of horizontal wells similarly drilled to form the other two sides. Four shorter horizontal wells are drilled from a vertical well at the center of the square, forming two straight lines orthogonal to each other. By modifying coal properties, especially sorption rate, we have approximated different types of coals. By varying operational parameters, such as injector length, injection well pressure, time to injection, and production well pressure, we can evaluate different production schemes to determine an optimum for each coal type. Any optimization requires considering a tradeoff between total CO 2 sequestered and the rate of methane production. Values of total CO 2 sequestered and methane produced are presented for multiple coal types and different operational designs. © 2005 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Design; Global warming; Horizontal wells; Methane; Sorption; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Coalbed methane production; Sorption rate; Coal",,,,,,"Pagnier, H., vanBergen, F., van deVate, L., Hills, L., Bamber, W., Inventory of the potential of combined coalbed methane production carbon dioxide disposal in the Dutch subsurface (1999) Proceedings, XIV International Congress on the Carboniferous and Permian (ICCP) 109; Stevens, S., Schoeling, L., Pekot, L., CO 2 Injection for Enhanced Coalbed Methane Recovery: Project Screening and Design (1999) Proceedings, International Coalbed Symposium, , University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, May 3-7; Gale, J., Freund, P., Coal Bed Methane Enhancement with CO 2 Sequestration Worldwide Potential (2001) Environ.
