The RSM is forced by perfect boundary conditions for winter (December-February) from 1979 to 2007. Analyses for two separate periods (1979-87 and 1999-2007) are performed to investigate the regional climate model's ability to simulate climate change in precipitation as well as large-scale circulation. The RSM reproduces differences in large-scale features associated with winter climate change over East Asia when the winter monsoon is modulated on decadal time scales with its weakening pattern observed since the late 1980s. The model adequately reproduces a weakening of the Siberian high and shallowness of the Aleutian low in the lower troposphere and a weakened East Asian coastal trough and East Asian jet in the upper troposphere during 1999-2007, as compared to the first nine winters of 1979-87. Conversely, the decadal shift in precipitation is not well reproduced by the model. The model is capable of reproducing the power spectrum of daily precipitation with maxima at 8.5 days and 45 days in 1979-87, whereas widely spread peaks in 1999-2007 are not captured. The increase of precipitation due to parameterized convection is prominent. This study shows that the dynamical numerical model has a limited capability to reproduce the wintertime hydrological climate over East Asia associated with global warming in recent years. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.",,"Aleutian low; Climate shifts; Decadal timescale; East Asia; Hydrological cycles; Large-scale circulation; Lower troposphere; Modeling studies; National centers for environmental predictions; Numerical models; Parameterized; Regional climate models; Regional spectral model; Siberian highs; Upper troposphere; Winter monsoon; Global warming; Troposphere; Climate models; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; global warming; numerical model; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; winter; Far East",,,,,,"Chang, C.-P., Erickson, J., Lau, K.-M., Northeasterly cold surges and near-equatorial disturbances over the winter-MONEX area during December 1974.
