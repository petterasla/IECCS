MM5 simulations were based on the IPCC's (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) A1B scenario, which has been described in detail in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. Regional climate projection showed that the annual mean value of daily mean temperatures will increase by 3.8°C between now and the 2071-2100 period. Comparing minimum and maximum temperatures, the change in minimum temperatures is expected to be larger (4.0°C) than that in maximum temperatures (3.5°C). Seasonally, the increase is projected to be greater in winter than in summer. Inter-annual variability is also projected to be higher in winter than in summer. In the troposphere, a rise in temperature shows a tendency to be greater with height; thus, increases are projected to reach a peak value of +4.5°C at 400 hPa. Frequency distributions of daily mean temperatures, showing an increase in the mean value without a change in variance, will reflect a change in temperature extremes. Hot events, based on the 95th percentile of the daily maximum temperatures, are expected to be intensified by 2.3°C and to be 5 times more frequent in the 2071-2100 period than in the 1971-2000 period. Cold events, based on the 5th percentile of daily minimum temperatures, are predicted to become warmer by 5.3°C, and the number of days involved will be reduced by 99%. The rise in temperature is projected to be associated with an increase in relative humidity of 2% and specific humidity of 29 % near the surface over Korea by the end of the 21st century. The projections show consistency between temperature and humidity changes, at a rate of about 7 % K-1 of the moisture holding capacity. © Inter-Research 2009.","A1B scenario; Future projection; Global warming; MM5","A1B scenario; Annual mean; Downscaling simulations; Frequency distributions; Future projections; Humidity change; Interannual variability; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Maximum temperature; Mean temperature; Mean values; Moisture holding capacity; Peak values; Regional climate; Regional climate simulation; Relative humidities; Special report on emissions scenarios; Specific humidity; Temperature extremes; Atmospherics; Global warming; Moisture; Atmospheric humidity; climate prediction; diurnal variation; downscaling; future prospect; global warming; humidity; moisture content; simulation; temperature gradient; troposphere; twenty first century; Korea",,,,,,"Alexander, L.V., Zhang, X., Peterson, T.C., Caesar, J., and others, Global observed changes in daily climate extremes of temperature and precipitation (2006) J Geophys Res, 111, pp. D05109. , doi:10.1029/2005JD006290; Boo, K.O., Kwon, W.T., Baek, H.J., (2006) Change of extreme events of temperature and precipitation over Korea using regional projection of future climate change, , Geophys Res; Lett 33:L01701, doi:10.1029/2005GL023378Brankovic, C., Palmer, T.N., Atmospheric seasonal predictability and estimates of ensemble size (1997) Mon Weather Rev, 125, pp. 859-874; Castro, C.L., Pielke Sr, R.A., Leoncini, G., Dynamical downscaling: Assessment of value retained and added using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) (2005) J Geophys Res, 110, pp. D05108. , doi:10.1029/2004JD004721; Dai, A., Meehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Wigley, T.M.L., Climate change in the 21st century over the Asia-Pacific region simulated by the NCAR CSM and PCM (2001) Adv Atmos Sci, 18, pp. 639-658; Denis, B., Laprise, R., Caya, D., Sensitivity of a regional climate model to the resolution of the lateral boundary conditions (2003) Clim Dyn, 20, pp. 107-126; Fu, C., Wang, S., Xiong, Z., Gutowski, W.J., and others, Regional climate model intercomparison project for Asia (2005) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 86, pp. 257-266; Giorgi, F., Mearns, L.O., Introduction to special section: Regional climate modeling revisited (1999) J Geophys Res, 104, pp. 6335-6352; Giorgi, F., Marinucci, M.R., Bates, G.T., Development of a second-generation regional climate model (RegCM2).
