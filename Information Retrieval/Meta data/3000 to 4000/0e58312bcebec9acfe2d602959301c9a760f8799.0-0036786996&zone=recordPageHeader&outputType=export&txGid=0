The bioclimatic program, BIOCLIM, was used to determine the current climatic ranges of 77 butterfly species restricted to Australia. We found that the majority of these species had fairly wide climatic ranges in comparison to other taxa, with only 8% of butterfly species having a mean annual temperature range spanning less than 3°C. The potential changes in the distributions of 24 butterfly species under four climate change scenarios for 2050 were also modelled using BIOCLIM. Results suggested that even species with currently wide climatic ranges may still be vulnerable to climate change; under a very conservative climate change scenario (with a temperature increase of 0.8-1.4°C by 2050) 88% of species distributions decreased, and 54% of species distributions decreased by at least 20%. Under an extreme scenario (temperature increase of 2.1-3.9°C by 2050) 92% of species distributions decreased, and 83% of species distributions decreased by at least 50%. Furthermore, the proportion of the current range that was contained within the predicted range decreased from an average of 63% under a very conservative scenario to less than 22% under the most extreme scenario. By assessing the climatic ranges that species are currently exposed to, the extent of potential changes in distributions in response to climate change and details of their life histories, we identified species whose characteristics may make them particularly vulnerable to climate change in the future.","BIOCLIM; Bioclimatic envelope; Butterflies; Climate change; Lepidoptera; Range shifts","bioclimatology; butterfly; climate change; ecological modeling; geographical distribution; Australia; Lepidoptera; Papilionoidea",,,,,,"(1999) Environmental Systems Research, , ArcInfo V.7.2 Institute, Inc, Redlands, CA; (1999) Environmental Systems Research, , ArcView V3.0 Institute, Inc, Redlands, CA; (1999) Center for Resource and Environmental Studies, , AUS40.DEM National Australian University, Canberra; Ayres, M.P., Scriber, J.M., Local adaptations to regional climates in Papilio candaensis (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) (1994) Ecological Monographs, 64, pp. 465-482; Bennett, S., Brereton, R., Mansergh, I., (1991) The Potential Effect of the Enhanced Greenhouse Climate Change on Selected Victorian Fauna, , Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research, Technical Report Series No. 123, Scientific Publications and Biometrics Section, Department of Conservation and Environment, Kew; Braby, M.F., (2000) Butterflies of Australia: Their Indentification, Biology and Distribution, , CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood; Brakefield, P., Geographical variability in and temperature effects on the phenology of Maniola jurtina and Pyronia tithonus (Lepidoptera: Satyrinae) in England and Wales, UK (1987) Ecological Entomology, 12, pp. 139-148; Busby, J.R., BIOCLIM-a bioclimatic analysis and prediction system (1991) Plant Protection Quarterly, 6, pp. 8-9; Buse, A., Dury, S.J., Woodburn, R.J.W., Effects of elevated temperature on multi-species interactions: The case of Pedunculate Oak, Winter Moth and Tits (1999) Functional Ecology, 13 (1 SUPPL.), pp. 74-82; Buse, A., Good, J.E.G., Synchronization of larval emergence in winter moth (Operophtera brumata L.) and budburst in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) under simulated climate change (1996) Ecological Entomology, 21, pp. 335-343; Buse, A., Good, J.E.G., Dury, S.J., Effects of elevated temperature and carbon dioxide on the nutritional quality of leaves of oak (Quercus robur L.) as food for the winter moth (Operophtera brumata L.)
