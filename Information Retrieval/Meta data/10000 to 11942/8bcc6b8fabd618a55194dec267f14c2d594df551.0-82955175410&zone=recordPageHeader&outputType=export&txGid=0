Our results showed that the annual precipitation in this westerly circulation dominated arid region is generally increasing during the past 80 years, with an apparent increasing trend (0.7 mm/10 a) in winter. The precipitation variations in ACA also differ regionally, which can be divided into five distinct subregions (I West Kazakhstan region, II East Kazakhstan region, III Central Asia Plains region, IV Kyrgyzstan region, and V Iran Plateau region). The annual precipitation falls fairly even on all seasons in the two northern subregions (regions I and II, approximately north of 45°N), whereas the annual precipitation is falling mainly on winter and spring (accounting for up to 80% of the annual total precipitation) in the three southern subregions. The annual precipitation is increasing on all subregions except the southwestern ACA (subregion V) during the past 80 years. A significant increase in precipitation appeared in subregions I and III. The long-term trends in annual precipitation in all subregions are determined mainly by trends in winter precipitation. Additionally, the precipitation in ACA has significant interannual variations. The 2-3-year cycle is identified in all subregions, while the 5-6-year cycle is also found in the three southern subregions. Besides the inter-annual variations, there were 3-4 episodic precipitation variations in all subregions, with the latest episodic change that started in the mid to late 1970s. The precipitations in most of the study regions are fast increasing since the late 1970s. Overall, the responses of ACA precipitation to global warming are complicated. The variations of westerly circulation are likely the major factors that influence the precipitation variations in the study region. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","annual and seasonal precipitation; arid Central Asia; changing tendency; regional difference","Annual precipitation; Central Asia; changing tendency; Climatic research; Interannual variation; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Long-term trend; Major factors; Plateau region; Precipitation variation; regional difference; Seasonal precipitations; Total precipitation; Winter precipitation; Arid regions; Global warming; annual variation; atmospheric circulation; global warming; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; westerly; Central Asia",,,,,,"Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis (2007) Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 4-6. , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Mann, M.E., Climate over the past two millennia (2007) Annu Rev Earth Planet Sci, 35, pp. 111-136; Mann, M.E., Zhang, Z.H., Hughes, M.K., Proxy-based reconstructions of hemispheric and global surface temperature variations over the past two millennia (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 13252-13257; Dai, A.G., Trenberth, K.E., Karl, T.R., Global variations in droughts and wet spells: 1900-1995 (1998) Geophys Res Lett, 25, pp. 3367-3370; Ma, Z.G., Fu, C.B., Global aridification in the second half of the 20th century and its relationship to large-scale climate background (2007) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 50, pp. 776-788; Hulme, M., Recent climatic change in the world's drylands (1996) Geophys Res Lett, 23, pp. 61-64; Rogers, J.C., Van, L.H., The seesaw in winter temperatures between Greenland and northern Europe.
