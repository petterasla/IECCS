In order to understand the structural and functional aspects of the alpine ecosystem and to promote a sustainable animal production system, the Haibei Alpine Meadow Research Station was established in 1976. A series of intensive studies on ecosystem structure and function, including the energy flow and nutrient cycling of the ecosystem, were the main tasks during the first 10 years. Meanwhile, studies with 5 different grazing intensities on both summer and winter pasture have been conducted. In the early years of the 1990s, the research station started to focus its research work on global warming, biodiversity and sustainable animal production systems in pastoral areas. Various methods for improving degraded pasturelands have been developed in the region.",,"alpine environment; ecosystem management; meadow; nature conservation; China",,,,,,"Zhou, X.M., Fan, N.C., Jing, Z.C., Mutuality between vegetation succession and dynamic of rodent population (1996) Proceedings Annual Symposium of Tibet, pp. 318-324. , Pan, Y.S.
