Coastal water resources are particularly vulnerable in dry regions. In view of the expected severity of future environmental change in the Southern Mediterranean Region, the European Commission supported an integrated multidisciplinary project, MELMARINA, on monitoring and modelling coastal lagoons in Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. This is a region where water management for people and for agriculture has been intense particularly during the twentieth century, yet long-term environmental monitoring and management of wetland ecosystems are under developed. Not only are biodiversity aspects at risk in coastal lagoons and wetlands but the goods and services that affect human welfare are also generally in decline. Co-ordinated hydro-ecological monitoring at key wetland lagoons was begun in 2003 with a view to establishing environmental baselines and calibrating site-specified hydro-ecological models. This article introduces the project and its results that range from lagoon typification and hydro-ecology to the application of hydro-ecological models. Detailed results and evaluations are presented in a linked series of themed scientific articles within this special issue. The present condition of the lagoons investigated essentially results from various hydrological modifications combined with eutrophication problems, yet all still remain valuable aquatic ecosystems. Adequate monitoring data are an essential part of reliable predictive modelling and, despite several data gaps, nutrient load reduction scenarios were undertaken to help target restoration aims. Implementation of aspects of the EU Water Framework Directive for achieving good ecological status of transitional waters is advocated. Nevertheless, as the twenty-first century advances the effects of global climate change are expected to amplify current stresses making intervention restoration and adaptation management even more imperative. Long-term sustainability depends upon detecting and measuring environmental change (long-term water quality and ecological quality) and incorporating the results into appropriate hydro-ecological models to facilitate the development of appropriate management initiatives. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Coastal lagoons; Environmental change; Hydro-ecological monitoring; Mediterranean; Modelling; North Africa","Biodiversity; Climate change; Climatology; Coastal zones; Ecology; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Hydraulic models; Lakes; Restoration; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Water resources; Wetlands; Coastal lagoons; Environmental change; Hydro-ecological monitoring; Mediterranean; Modelling; North Africa; Monitoring; biodiversity; climate change; coastal lagoon; coastal zone management; disturbance; environmental change; environmental modeling; environmental restoration; European Union; eutrophication; Mediterranean environment; sustainability; twentieth century; twenty first century; water management; water resource; Africa; North Africa",,,,,,"Ahmed, M.H., El Leithy, B.M., Thompson, J.R., Flower, R.J., Ramdani, M., Ayache, F., Hassan, S.M., Application of remote sensing to site characterisation and environmental change analysis of North Africa coastal lagoons (2009) Hydrobiologia, , 10.1007/s10750-008-9682-8; Allan, T., (2000) The Middle East Water Question-Hydropolitics and the Global Economy, , Taurus Academic Publishers London; Appleby, P.G., Birks, H.H., Flower, R.J., Rose, N., Peglar, S.M., Ramdani, M., Kraiem, M.M., Fathi, A.A., Recent environmental change in North African wetland lakes: Radiometric dating and recent sediment accumulation rates in sediment cores from nine sites in the CASSARINA Project (2001) Aquatic Ecology, 35, pp. 347-367; Arnell, N.W., Climate change and global water resources: SRES emissions and socio-economic scenarios (2004) Global Environmental Change, 14, pp. 31-52; Ayache, F., Thompson, J.R., Flower, R.J., Boujarra, A., Rouatbi, F., Makina, H., Environmental characteristics, landscape history and pressures on three coastal lagoons in the Southern Mediterranean Region: Merja Zerga (Morocco), Ghar El Melh (Tunisia) and Lake Manzala (Egypt) (2009) Hydrobiologia, , 10.1007/s10750-008-9676-6; Benessaiah, N., Belhaj, M., (1999) Mediterranean Wetlands Socio-economic Aspects. the MedWet Programme: Conservation and Wise Use of Wetlands in the Mediterranean Basin, , Ramsar Convention Bureau Gland; Biswas, A.K., Land resources for sustainable agricultural development in Egypt (1993) Ambio, 22, pp. 556-560; Birks, H.H., Peglar, S.M., Boomer, I., Flower, R.J., Ramdani, M., Appleby, P.G., Bjune, A.E., Abdelzahar, H.M.A., Palaeolimnological responses of nine North African lakes in the Cassarina Project to recent environmental changes and human impact detected by plant macrofossil, pollen, and benthic animal analyses.
