An improved understanding of droughts and their association with atmospheric circulation will add to the knowledge about the controls on drought, and the ways in which changes in climate may impact droughts. In this study, 1) major drought patterns across the United States have been defined, 2) the robustness of these patterns over time using tree-ring-based drought reconstructions have been evaluated, and 3) the drought patterns with respect to global atmospheric pressure patterns have been assessed. From this simple assessment, it is suggested that there are two major drought patterns across North America, which together account for about 30% of the total variance in drought patterns - one resembles the classic ENSO teleconnection, and the other displays an east-west drought dipole. The same two patterns are evident in the instrumental data and the reconstructed drought data for two different periods, 1404-2003 and 900-1350. The 500-mb circulation patterns associated with the two drought patterns suggest that the controls on drought may come from both Northern Hemisphere and tropical sources. The two drought patterns, and presumably their associated circulation patterns, vary in strength over time, indicating the combined effects of the two patterns on droughts over the past millennium. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric circulation; Circulation patterns; Climate variability; Combined effect; Global climate changes; Instrumental data; North American; Northern Hemispheres; Paleoclimatic data; Teleconnections; Total variance; Tree rings; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospherics; Climate change; Drought; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric pressure; climate variation; drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global climate; Northern Hemisphere; paleoclimate; reconstruction; teleconnection; North America; United States",,,,,,"Arblaster, J., Summary for policymakers (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, pp. 1-21. , S.
