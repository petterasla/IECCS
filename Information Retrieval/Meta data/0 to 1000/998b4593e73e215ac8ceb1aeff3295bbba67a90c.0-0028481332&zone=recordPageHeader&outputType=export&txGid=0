The major greenhouse gas is CO2, large quantities of which are produced by combustion of fossil fuels; coal being a major contributor. Whereas a great deal of effort is being expended on the science of climate change, very little work has gone into mitigation technologies. This is now changing. The options include improved energy utilization efficiency, fuel switching, non-fossil energy sources, and pre- and post-combustion removal and disposal of CO2 from central power stations. Another approach is the pre-combustion conversion of fossil fuel to a carbon-rich fraction and a hydrogen-rich fraction; storing the carbon-rich and only utilizing the hydrogen-rich fraction. By coprocessing with the biomass, the CO2 emission from fossil fuel can be reduced to negligible values. Assessment of these systems is discussed. © 1994.",,"Air pollution control; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Combustion; Energy conversion; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Synthetic fuels; Fuel switching; Global warming problem; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Hydrogen rich fraction; Mitigation technologies; Nonfossil energy sources; Energy utilization",,,,,,"Steinberg, Lee, Morris, (1991) An assessment of CO2 greenhouse gas mitigation technologies, , BNL 46045, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY; Grohse, Steinberg, (1987) Economical clean carbon and gaseous fuels from coal and other carbonaceous materials, , BNL 40485, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY; Steinberg, (1989) Coal to methanal to gasoline by the HYDROCARB process, , BNL 43555, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY; Steinberg, (1991) Biomass and HYDROCARB technology for removal of atmospheric CO2, , BNL 44410, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY; Steinberg, Grohse, (1990) Production of a clean carbon fuel and reproduct gaseous and liquid fuels from coal by the HYDROCARB process system, , BNL 46490, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY; Borgardt, Steinberg, Grohse, Tung, Biomass and fossil fuel to methanol and carbon via the HYDROCARB Process (1991) EPA paper; Steinberg, Grohse, (1989) Economical clean carbon fuel and-co-product gaseous and liquid fuel from coal, , BNL 42489, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY; Steinberg, Grohse, Tung, (1991) A feasibility study for the co-processing of fossil fuel with biomass by the HYDROCARB process, , BNL 46058, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY; Steinberg, Grohse, Hydrocarb-M™ process for conversion of coals to a carbon-methanol liquid fuel (Carboline-M™) (1989) BNL 43569, , Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY","Steinberg, M.; Department of Applied Science, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, United States",,,,,,,,03603199,,IJHED,,"English","Int J Hydrogen Energy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028481332
