We use each warming scenario to produce an electricity demand projection with end-use energy models. Our analysis focuses on the heating and cooling of buildings and the pumping and transport of water for farms and cities. The results suggest global warming has a moderate effect on electricity demand. Under our worst scenario, a 1.9°C increase, we project Statewide electricity requirements will increase by about 7 500 GWh (2.6%) and 2 400 MW (3.7%). We conclude discussion with thoughts on the implications a warmer world may have for energy forecasters and resource planners. © 1992.","Electricity demand; Energy planning; Global warming","electricity demand; energy model; global warming; simulation model; USA, California",,,,,,"Kellogg, Schware, (1981) Climate Change and Society, , For examples see, Westview Press, Boulder, CO, USA; Lowe, The energy policy implications of climate change (1988) Greenhouse: Planning for Climate Change, pp. 602-612. , G.I.

See The Impacts of Global Warming on California, California Energy Commission, P500-89-004, 1989. The Commission study was prepared in response to Assembly Bill 4420, which directed the Commission to assess how warming trends may affect California. For details on the energy demand implications from this earlier work, see L.W. Baxter, ‘The effect of global warming on space conditioning in California by 2050’, Appendix A in The Impacts of Global Warming on CaliforniaIn California we estimate about 46% of households in 1987 own cooling equipment and this saturation increases to 58% by 2010 in our base case forecast. Thus, the saturation of cooling equipment is already quite high. In California's largest planning areas, the majority of new homes have space cooling equipment. New home surveys by PG&E and SCE indicate the saturation of electric central air conditioners is two to three times greater in new homes (that is, those built about 1980 or later) than old homes. See Pacific Gas and Electric Company, ‘New homes survey’, prepared under direction of the Economics and Forecasting Department of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, San Francisco, CA, USA, 1986; and R. Garwacki, ‘New home study’, Southern California Edison Co, Rosemead, CA, USA, 1986. Our assumption for California's warmer climate zones is that the majority of new homes have space cooling equipment.

The Commission divides California into eight planning areas, but the five largest planning areas account for over 95% of total Statewide electricity use and demand. The five largest planning areas are Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), Southern California Edison (SCE), Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E)Jaeger, Developing Policies for Responding to Climate Change (1988) World Climate Programmer Impact Studies, WMO/TD-No 225; The low and high temperature increase scenarios in this analysis are consistent with the medium and high scenarios described in Ibid. GCMs are being continuously modified and improved. More recent climate simulations suggest a somewhat lower climate sensitivity than the results available at the time of the Bellagio Report. Our use of these more recent results would lead to lower temperature increase estimates. Our focus, however, is not on climate change, but instead on the energy demand implications of a given temperature increase. A smaller temperature increase would reduce somewhat the energy demand impacts, which would only reinforce the conclusions and recommendations from our analysisJaeger, Developing Policies for Responding to Climate Change (1988) World Climate Programmer Impact Studies, WMO/TD-No 225, , The GCM results reviewed in; Hansen, Climate sensitivity: analysis of feedback mechanisms (1984) Climate Processes and Climate Sensitivity, Geophysical Monograph Series, 29, pp. 130-163. , The two models reviewed are from, J.

Changing precipitation patterns and subsequent effects on snowpack size may change the amount and timing of hydroelectric supplies. Peak hydrogeneration is expected to decline and, more importantly, shift from summer and spring to earlier in the year when the demand for energy is not as great; Department of Water Resources, (1978) The 1976–1977 Drought, , California Department of Water Resources, Our agriculture and water pumping model does suggest warming will result in slight changes in crop patterns and yields over our 20-year forecast horizon, but these changes are due predominantly to our assumptions about water availability and not to the direct effects of higher temperatures; Baxter, Peak demand forecasting model (1988) California Energy Demand 1987–2007: Electricity Demand Forecasting Methods, pp. 7dash1-7dash53. , California Energy Commission, P300-87-014; Karl, Baldwin, Burgin, (1988) Time series of regional season average of maximum, minimum, and average temperature, and diurnal temperature range acrosst the United States: 1901–1984, , National Climate Data Center, Asheville, NC, USA; Hansen, Global climate change as forecast by Goddard Institute for Space Studies three-dimensional model (1988) Journal of Geophysical Research, 93, pp. 9341-9364; Hourly temperature changes for the peak event are assumed to follow a sine function with an amplitude of 12 hours.

Thus, the Statewide peak impacts are reported as the sum of each individual planning area's impact. See A planning area is a geographic region around each of the State's major investor-owned or municipal utilities that includes the utility's retail customers as well as resale customers and self-generators. The Commission divides California into eight planning areas, but the five largest planning areas account for over 95% of total Statewide electricity use and demand. The five largest planning areas are Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), Southern California Edison (SCE), Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E). for the definition of a planning areaWe modeled global warming impacts on agriculture and water pumping assuming uniform increases in daily temperatures. This assumption is most consistent with our assumption of nearly uniform temperature increase in the cooling impacts analysis; thus, we add results from each to estimate the total effects of warming on electricity useWe express the temperature sensitivity of demand as the percent change in total demand for a 1°C increase in average temperatureCalifornia Energy Commission, (1988) California Energy Demand 1987–2007: Revised Electricity Demand Forecasts, , California Energy Commission, P300-88-005; California Energy Commission, (1988) California Energy Demand 1987–2007: Revised Electricity Demand Forecasts, , California Energy Commission, P300-88-005; California Energy Commission, (1988) California Energy Demand 1987–2007: Revised Electricity Demand Forecasts, , California Energy Commission, P300-88-005; Schneider, The greenhouse effect: science and policy (1989) Science, 243, pp. 771-781; Mintzer, A Matter of Degrees: The Potential for Controlling the Greenhouse Effect (1987) Research Report No 5, , Numerous studies could be cited.
