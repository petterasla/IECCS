This article presents a method to select such materials (i.e., sustainable materials) for foundations of buildings (elements) in Sri Lanka taking into consideration environmental, economic and social assessments of materials in a life cycle perspective. Rubble and burnt clay bricks elements which are widely used for the masonry buildings in Sri Lanka were selected for this study. Major materials used for these elements are rubble, burnt clay bricks, cement, sand, concrete aggregates and steel (reinforcements). Environmental burdens associated with these materials were analyzed in terms of embodied energy, global warming, acidification and nutrient enrichment. Economic analysis was based on market prices and affordability of materials. Social factors that were taken into account were ability to construct rapidly, strength, reusability and durability. It was found that the rubble element was superior to the brick element in all environmental scores (embodied energy, global warming, acidification and nutrient enrichment). The embodied energy of the rubble element was found as 6.7 GJ and that of the brick element was 444.7 GJ. However, on economic score the brick element was slightly better and on social score also, this element was better. The social score of the brick element was 104.7 and that of the rubble element was 94.6. These scores are presented in a matrix which will help to select sustainable materials for these elements. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Economic score; Embodied energy; Material selection matrix; Social factor; Sustainable materials","Economic Score; Embodied energy; Material selection matrix; Social factor; Sustainable materials; Brickmaking; Building materials; Concrete aggregates; Economic analysis; Global warming; Nutrients; Reusability; Brick",,,,,,"Harding, R., (1998) Environmental Decision Making, , NSW, Australia: The Federation Press; Declaration, R., (1992) Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, , http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?
