This is largely because these regions contain vast areas of permafrost, which begins to thaw when the mean annual temperature rises above freezing. The Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab has developed a new interactive geographical information systems (GIS) model to estimate the long-term response of permafrost to changes in climate. An analytical approach is used for calculating both active layer thickness (ALT) and mean annual ground temperatures (MAGTs). When applied to long-term (decadal or longer time scale) averages, this approach shows an accuracy of ±0.2-0.4°C for MAGTs and ±0.1-0.3 m for ALT calculations. The relative errors do not exceed 32% for ALT calculations, but typically they are between 10 and 25%. A spatial statistical analysis of the data from 32 sites in Siberia indicated a confidence level of 75% to have a deviation between measured and calculated MAGTs of 0.2-0.4°C. A detailed analysis has been performed for two regional transects in Alaska and eastern Siberia that has validated the use of the model. The results obtained from this analysis show that a more economical (in terms of computational time) analytical approach could be successfully used instead of a full-scale numerical model in the regional and global scale analysis of permafrost spatial and temporal dynamics. This project has been a successful contribution to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment project.
