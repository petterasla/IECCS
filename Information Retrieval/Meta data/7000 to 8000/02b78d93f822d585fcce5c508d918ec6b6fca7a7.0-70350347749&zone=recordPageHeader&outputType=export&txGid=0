Farming systems should aim at maximizing plant biomass production from locally available diversified resources, processing of the biomass on farm to provide food, feed and energy and recycling of all waste materials. The approach that is the subject of this paper is that the generation of electricity can be a by-product of food/feed production. The concept is the fractionation of biomass into inedible cell wall material that can be converted to an inflammable gas by gasification, the gas in turn being the source of fuel for internal combustion engines driving electrical generators. The cell contents and related structures such as tree leaves are used as human food or animal feed. As well as providing food and feed the model is highly appropriate for decentralized small scale production of electricity in rural areas. It also offers opportunities for sequestration of carbon in the form of biochar the solid residue remaining after gasification of the biomass. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V 2009.","Biofuel; Electricity; Ethanol; Forage trees; Fractionation; Goats; Rural development; Sugar cane","Animalia; Capra hircus; Saccharum",,,,,,"Badger, P.C., Ethanol from Cellulose: A General Review (2002) Trends in new crops and new uses, pp. 17-21. , http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/ncnu02/v5-017.html, In: Janick J and Whipkey A (eds), ASHS Press: Alexandria, Virginia, USA; Botero, R., Preston, T.R., (1987) Biodigestor de bajo costo para la producción de combustible y fertilizante a partir de excretas: Manual para su instalación, operación y utilización, , http://www.utafoundation.org/publications/botero&preston.pdf, Centro para la Investigacion en Sistemas Sostenibles de Produccion Agropecuaria: Cali, Colombia; Bui Xuan, A., Preston, T.R., Dolberg, F., The introduction of low-cost polyethylene tube biodigesters on small scale farms in Vietnam (1997) Livestock Research for Rural Development, 20 (1). , http://www.cipav.org.co/lrrd/lrrd9/2/an92.htm; Turare, C., (1997) Biomass Gasification Technology and Utilization, , http://members.tripod.com/%7ecturare/bio.htm, ARTES Institute, University of Flensburge: Flemsburge, Germany; Khang, D.N., Tuan, L.M., Transferring the low cost plastic film biodigester technology to farmers (2002) Proceedings of the Biodigester Workshop, March 2002, Hanoi, Vietnam, , http://www.mekarn.org/procbiod/khang2a.htm; Kormondy, E.J., (1969) Concepts of Ecology, , Prentice-Hall: Engelwood Cliffs, NJ, USA; Lehmann, J., A handful of carbon (2007) Nature, 447, pp. 143-144. , (10 May 2007); Phalla, M., Preston, T.R., Evaluating selected inedible fibrous crop residues as feedstock for gasification (MSc Thesis) (2005) MEKARN-SLU, , http://www.mekarn.org/msc2003-05/theses05/phalla1.pdf; Monbiot, G., Feeding cars, not people (2004) The Guardian, , Tuesday 22 November 2004; Patzek, T.W., How can we outlive our way of life (2007) Paper prepared for the 20th Round Table on Sustainable Development of Biofuels: Is the Cure Worse than the Disease?
