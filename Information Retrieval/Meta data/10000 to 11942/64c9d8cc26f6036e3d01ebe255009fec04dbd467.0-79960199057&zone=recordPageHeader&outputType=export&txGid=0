Currently, a significant amount of bioethanol and biodiesel are produced as biofuels to partially replace gasoline and diesel, respectively, in the transportation sector worldwide. However, these biofuels represent a tiny portion (<4%) of the total fuels consumed. Furthermore, bioethanol is produced predominantly from sugarcane and corn, and biodiesel from crop and plant oils. Production of these raw materials is competing for the limited arable land against food and feed production. It is not feasible to tremendously increase biofuel production using the current technologies. Therefore, it is critical to investigate advanced or 2nd generation biofuel production technologies. This article is trying to summarize the current status of the 2nd generation biofuel technologies including bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials and biodiesel from microalgae. The summary includes the descriptions of the technologies, their advantages and challenges, feedstocks for the 2nd generation biofuels, the key barriers to their commercial applications, and future perspectives of the advanced technologies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiesel; Biofuel; Ethanol; Lignocelluloses; Microalgae","Advanced technology; Arable land; Biofuel production; Commercial applications; Current status; Current technology; Future perspectives; Global climate changes; Lignocelluloses; Lignocellulosic material; Micro-algae; Plant oil; Renewable resource; Transportation sector; Algae; Biodiesel; Climate change; Ethanol; Microorganisms; Raw materials; Technology; Vegetable oils; Bioethanol; advanced technology; arable land; biofuel; biomass power; cellulose; climate change; commercialization; crop plant; ethanol; feasibility study; global climate; lignin; literature review; microalga; renewable resource; sustainability; Zea mays",,,,,,"Licht, F.O., 2008 world fuel ethanol production (2009) Renewable Fuels Assoc, , http://www.ethanolrfa.org/resource/facts/trade/; Sun, Y., Cheng, J., Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials for ethanol production: a review (2002) Bioresour Technol, 83, pp. 1-11; Fan, L.T., Gharpuray, M.M., Lee, Y.-H., (1987) Cellulose hydrolysis biotechnology monographs, , Springer, Berlin; Beguin, P., Aubert, J.-P., The biological degradation of cellulose (1994) FEMS Microbiol Rev, 13, pp. 25-58; Stubbendieck, J.L., Hatch, S.L., Butterfield, C.H., (1997) North American range plants, , University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln; Boateng, A.A., Anderson, W.F., Phillips, J.G., Bermudagrass for biofuels: Effect of two genotypes on pyrolysis product yield (2007) Energy & Fuels, 21, pp. 1183-1187; Kim, S., Dale, B.E., Global potential bioethanol production from wasted crops and crop residues (2004) Biomass and Bioenergy, 26, pp. 361-375; Heaton, E.A., Flavell, R.B., Mascia, P.N., Thomas, S.R., Dohleman, F.G., Long, S.P., Herbaceous energy crop development: recent progress and future prospects (2008) Curr Opin Biotechnol, 19, pp. 202-209; Kadam, K.L., McMillan, J.D., Availability of corn stover as a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production (2003) Bioresour Technol, 88, pp. 17-25; Schmidt, A.S., Bjerre, A.B., Pretreatment of agricultural crop residues for conversion to high-value products (1997) Cereals: Novel uses and processes, , Plenum Press, New York, G.M.
