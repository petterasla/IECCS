The reservations are supported by reference to a mechanism of chemotaxis in bacteria. A recent publication concerning the Gaia hypothesis and global warming is reviewed. Design/methodology/approach: The aim is to review developments on the internet, especially those of general cybernetic interest. Findings: The significance of complexity, in government and management, is not disputed, but doubts are expressed about validity of laws that are purported to treat it quantitatively. A pessimistic view of world future is due to James Lovelock, the originator of the Gaia hypothesis, though there is some reason to believe he is more hopeful than is suggested in an interview. Practical implications: The reservations about Ashby's treatment of complexity are essentially theoretical and do not negate findings based on its robust and imprecise application. Lovelock indicates a means of saving the Earth from disastrous climate change but has little hope that it will be implemented. Originality/value: It is hoped this is a valuable periodic review. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cybernetics; Ecology; Economic theory; World economy",,,,,,,"Alberts, B., Johnson, A., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K., Walte, P., (2002) Molecular Biology of the Cell, pp. 890-2. , 4th ed., Garland, New York, NY, (also treated in earlier editions, by Alberts, B., Bray, D., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K. and Watson, J.D., 1983, 1989, 1994, on pages indicated by Bacterial Chemotaxis in subject indices); Ashby, W.R., (1960) Design for a Brain, , 2nd ed., Chapman and Hall, London; Beer, S., (1975) Platform for Change, , Wiley, London; Berg, H.C., How bacteria swim (1975) Scientific American, 233 (2), pp. 36-44; Conant, R.C., Ashby, W.R., Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system (1970) International Journal of Systems Science, 1, pp. 89-97; Shannon, C.E., Weaver, W., (1949) The Mathematical Theory of Communication, pp. 37-9. , University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL","Andrew, A.
