The fate of this vast pool of carbon is important since carbon sequestration and the generation of landfill gases have important implications for global warming. Published estimates of methane yields were used to estimate the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere from landfilled forest products. These calculations suggest that maximally only 30% of the carbon from paper and 03% of the carbon from wood are ever emitted as landfill gas. The remaining carbon, approximately 28 Tg in 1993, remains in the landfill indefinitely. Some of this carbon may be removed during leachate treatment, but a large portion is permanently sequestered where its impact on global warming is negligible. The placement of forest products in landfills serves as a significant carbon sink, and its importance in the global carbon balance should not be overlooked.Large quantities of forest products are disposed of in landfills annually.
