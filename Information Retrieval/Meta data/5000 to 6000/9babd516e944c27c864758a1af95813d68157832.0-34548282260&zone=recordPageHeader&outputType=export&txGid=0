Concerns about consequences of deforestation for global climate change and biodiversity have received the most publicity, but loss of wetlands, declining land productivity and watershed management are also problems facing developing countries. Analyses of these problems are especially constrained by lack of data. This article reviews modelling approaches for data-constrained environments that involve discrete choice methods including neural nets and dynamic programming, and research results that link individual household survey data with satellite images using geographic positioning systems. © 2007 The Agricultural Economics Society.","Deforestation; Geographic information systems; Land use in developing countries; Remotely sensed data; Spatial analysis","deforestation; developing world; GIS; land use change; modeling; remote sensing",,,,,,"Aguirregabiria, V., Mira, P., 'Swapping the nested fixed point algorithm: A class of estimators for discrete Markov decision models' (2002) Econometrica, 70, pp. 1519-1543; Anselin, L., 'Spatial externalities, spatial multipliers, and spatial econometrics' (2003) International Regional Science Review, 26, pp. 153-166; Beattie, B.R., Taylor, C.R., (1993) The Economics of Production, , (Malabar: Krieger Publishing Company); Besag, J., 'Spatial interaction and the statistical analysis of lattice systems' (1974) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 36, pp. 192-236; Boscolo, M., Kerr, S., Pfaff, A., Sanchez, A., (1999) What Role for Tropical Forests in Climate Change Mitigation?
