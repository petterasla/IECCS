However, the process of creating concentrated biomass from microalgal cultures is limited by ineffective dewatering procedures. The economics of existing culture clarification unit operations make the process of creating biomass from microalgae unattractive for biofuel development. This work involves the comparison of the removal efficiency (recovery) of two marine microalgae species Chlorococcum sp. and Tetraselmis sp. by electrocoagulation (EC), a technique that has not been thoroughly explored in marine microalgae dewatering. High recovery efficiencies were obtained of up to 99 and 98% for Tetraselmis sp. and Chlorococcum sp., respectively. The effect of culture temperature and salinity on removal efficiency was also observed. A starting temperature of 60°C resulted in optimal recovery values of 96 and 94% for Chlorococcum sp. and Tetraselmis sp., respectively. Whereas a starting temperature of 5°C achieved optimal recovery of only 5 and 68% for Chlorococcum sp. and Tetraselmis sp., respectively. Increased salinity of microalgae culture showed increased microalgae recovery. Salinity of 20% gave optimal microalgae recovery values of only 6 and 9% for Chlorococcum sp. and Tetraselmis sp., respectively. Zeta potential (ZP) analysis was carried out to verify and further understand the charge neutralization mechanism due to Fe2+ cations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiesel; Dewatering; Electrocoagulation; Microalgae separation; Zeta potential","Biodiesel production; Biofuel production; Charge neutralization; Culture temperature; Electrocoagulation; Marine microalgae; Micro-algae; Microalgae culture; Microalgal biomass; Microalgal cultures; Optimal recovery; Parametric study; Petroleum prices; Recovery efficiency; Recovery process; Removal efficiencies; Zeta potential (zp); Biodiesel; Biomass; Coagulation; Dewatering; Efficiency; Global warming; Microorganisms; Optimization; Recovery; Salinity measurement; Zeta potential; Algae; Chlorococcum; Tetraselmis",,,,,,"Singh, A., Nigam, P.S., Murphy, J.D., Mechanism and challenges in commercialisation of algal biofuels (2010) Bioresource Technology, 102, pp. 26-34; Miao, X., Wu, Q., Biodiesel production from heterotrophic microalgal oil (2006) Bioresource Technology, 97, pp. 841-846; Xu, H., Miao, X., Wu, Q., High quality biodiesel from microalgae Chlorella protothecoides by heterotrophic growth in fermenters (2006) Journal of Biotechnology, 126, pp. 499-507; Chisti, Y., Biodiesel from microalgae (2007) Biotechnology Advances, 25, pp. 294-306; Gouveia, L., Oliveira, A.C., Microalgae as a raw material for biofuels production (2009) Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, 36, pp. 269-274; Chisti, Y., Biodiesel from microalgae beats bioethanol (2008) Trends in Biotechnology, 26 (3), pp. 126-131; De La Noue, J., De Pauw, N., The potential of microalgal biotechnology: a review of production and uses of microalgae (1988) Biotechnology Advances, 6, pp. 725-770; Antoni, D., Zverlov, V.V., Schwarz, W.H., Biofuels from microbes (2007) Applied Microbiology Biotechnology, 77, pp. 23-35; Edzwald, J.K., Algae, bubbles, coagulants and dissolved air flotation (1993) Water Science Technology, 27 (10), pp. 67-81; Edzwald, J.K., Principles and applications of dissolved air flotation (1995) Water Science Technology, 31 (3-4), pp. 1-23; Moraine, R., Shelef, G., Sandbank, E., Bar-moshe, Z., Shvartzburd, L., Recovery of sewage-borne algae: flocculation, flotation, and centrifugation techniques (1980) Algae Biomass Production and Use, , Elsevier/North Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam, New York, Oxford, G.
