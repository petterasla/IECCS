Islands initially formed on a foundation of lagoonall sediments between 5500 and 4500 yr B.P. when the reef surface was as much as 2.5 m below modern sea level. Islands accumulated rapidly during the following 1500 yr, effectively reaching their current dimensions by 4000 yr B.P. Since then the high circum-island peripheral ridge has been subject to seasonal and longer-term shoreline changes, while the outer reef has grown upward, reducing the energy window and confining the islands. This new model has far-reaching implications for island stability during a period of global warming and raised sea level, which will partially reactivate the energy window, although it is not expected to inhibit upward reef growth or compromise island stability. © 2005 Geological Society of America.","Atoll; Coral reefs; Holocene; Reef islands; Sea-level rise; Sedimentation","Island stability; Lagoonall sediments; Morphostratigraphic analysis; Reef surfaces; Geochronology; Global warming; Radiometry; Sea level; Sediments; Stratigraphy; Reefs; atoll; deposition; island; model; reef formation; sea level change; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Maldives; oceanic regions; World",,,,,,"Bronk Ramsey, C., Development of the radiocarbon program OxCal (2001) Radiocarbon, 43, pp. 355-363; Camoin, G.F., Colonna, M., Montaggioni, L.F., Casanova, J., Faure, G., Thomassin, B.A., Holocene sea level changes and reef development in the southwestern Indian Ocean (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. 247-259; Church, J.A., Gregory, J.M., Changes in sea level (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 639-693. , Houghton, J.T., et al., eds., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Clark, J.A., Farrell, W.E., Peltier, W.R., Global change in post glacial sea level: A numerical calculation (1978) Quaternary Research, 9, pp. 265-287; Dickinson, W.R., Holocene sea-level record on Funafuti and potential impact of global warming on central Pacific atolls (1999) Quaternary Research, 51, pp. 124-132; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's coral reefs (1999) Marine and Freshwater Research, 50, pp. 839-866; Kench, P.S., Parnell, K.E., Brander, R.W., A process based assessment of engineered structures on reef islands of the Maldives (2003) Proceedings, Coasts and Ports Australasian Conference 2003, p. 10. , Kench, P.S., and Hume, T.M., eds., Auckland, Coasts and Ports Australasian Conference Organising Committee Paper 74; Kleypas, J.A., Buddemeier, R.W., Archer, D., Gattuso, J.-P., Langdon, G., Opdyke, B., Geochemical consequences of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on coral reefs (1999) Science, 284, pp. 118-120; McCulloch, M., Fallon, S., Wyndham, T., Hendy, E., Lough, J., Barnes, D., Coral record of increased sediment flux to the inner Great Barrier Reef since European settlement (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 727-730; McLean, R.F., Hosking, P.L., Geomorphology of reef islands and atoll Motu in Tuvalu (1991) South Pacific Journal of Natural Science, 11, pp. 167-189; McLean, R.F., Woodroffe, C.D., Coral atolls (1994) Coastal Evolution, pp. 267-302. , Carter, R.W.G., and Woodroffe, C.D., eds., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Richmond, B.M., Development of atoll islets in the central Pacific (1994) Proceedings 7th International Coral Reef Symposium, 2, pp. 1185-1194. , Guam, University of Guam Press; Southon, J., Kashgarian, M., Fontugne, M., Metivier, B., Yim, W., Marine reservoir corrections for the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia (2002) Radiocarbon, 44, pp. 167-180; Stuiver, M., Reimer, P.J., Bard, E., Beck, J.W., Burr, G.S., Hughen, K.A., Kromer, B., Spark, M., INTCAL98 radiocarbon age calibration, 24000-0 cal BP (1998) Radiocarbon, 40, pp. 1041-1083; Woodroffe, C.D., Morphology and evolution of reef islands in the Maldives (1994) Proceedings 7th International Coral Reef Symposium, 2, pp. 1217-1226. , Guam, University of Guam Press; Woodroffe, C.D., McLean, R.F., Smithers, S.G., Lawson, E.M., Atoll reef-island formation and response to sea level change: West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands (1999) Marine Geology, 180, pp. 85-104","Kench, P.S.; Sch. of Geogr./Environmental Science, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,,,,,00917613,,GLGYB,,"English","Geology",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-13944278817
