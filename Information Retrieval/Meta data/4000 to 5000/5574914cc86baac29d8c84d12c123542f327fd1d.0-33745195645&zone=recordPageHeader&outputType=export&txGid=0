Rising [CO 2] above that present at the beginning of the 20th century resulted in consistent, significant increases in leaf area, and above ground dry weight (both species), but decreased leaf area ratio (LAR) and specific leaf area (SLA) in jimson weed. Increased temperature resulted in earlier development and increased leaf area for both species, but increases in above ground final dry weight were observed only for jimson weed. The secondary compounds evaluated included the alkaloids, nicotine, atropine and scopolamine. These compounds are generally recognized as having impacts with respect to herbivory as well as human physiology. Rising [CO 2] reduced the concentration of nicotine in tobacco; but had no effect on atropine, and increased the concentration of scopolamine in jimson weed. However, because of the stimulatory effect of [CO 2] on growth, the amount of all three secondary compounds increased on a per plant basis in both species. Temperature per se had no effect on nicotine or scopolamine concentration, but significantly increased the concentration and amounts of atropine per plant. Overall, the underlying mechanism of CO 2 induced changes in secondary compounds remains unclear; however, these data suggest that the increase in [CO 2] and temperature associated with global climate change may have significant effects not only with respect to herbivory, but on the production of secondary compounds of pharmacological impact. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Atropine; Jimson weed; Nicotine; Scopolamine; Tobacco","air temperature; alkaloid; carbon dioxide; leaf area; tobacco; weed; Datura stramonium; Nicotiana tabacum",,,,,,"Baldwin, I.T., Zhang, Z.-P., Diab, N., Quantification, correlations and manipulations of wound-induced changes in jasmonic acid and nicotine in Nicotiana sylvestris (1997) Planta, 201, pp. 397-404; Bryant, J.P., Chapin, F.S., Klein, D.R., Carbon/nutrient balance of boreal plants in relation to vertebrate herbivory (1983) Oikos, 40, pp. 357-368; Cheeke, P.R., (1989) Toxicants of Plant Origin: Alkaloids, 1. , CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, USA; Fajer, E.D., Bowers, M.D., Bazzaz, F.A., The effects of enriched carbon dioxide atmospheres on plant-insect herbivore interactions (1989) Science, 243, pp. 1198-1201; Farnsworth, N.R., Akerele, O., Bingel, A.S., Medicinal plants in therapy (1985) Bulletin of the WHO, 63, pp. 965-981; Gebauer, R.L.E., Strain, B.R., Reynolds, J.F., The effect of elevated CO 2 and N availability on tissue concentrations and whole plant pools of carbon-based secondary compounds in loblolly pin (Pinus taeda) (1998) Oecologia, 113, pp. 29-36; Heyworth, C.J., Iason, G.R., Temperton, V., The effect of elevated CO 2 concentration and nutrient supply on carbon-based plant secondary metabolites in Pinus sylvestris L (1998) Oecologia, 115, pp. 344-350; Idso, S.B., Kimball, B.A., Pettit III, G.R., Effects of atmospheric CO 2 enrichment on the growth and development of Hymenocallis littoralis (Amaryllideceae) and the concentrations of several antineoplastic and antiviral constituents of its bulbs (2000) American Journal of Botany, 87, pp. 769-773; Johnson, E.L., Emche, S.D., Variation of alkaloid content in Erythoxylum coca leaves from leaf bud to leaf drop (1994) Annals of Botany, 73, pp. 645-650; Kainulainen, P., Holopainen, J.K., Holopainen, T., The influence of elevated CO 2 and O 3 concentrations on Scots pine needles: Changes in starch and secondary metabolites over three exposure years (1998) Oecologia, 114, pp. 455-460; Karowe, D.N., Seimens, D.H., Mitchell-Olds, T., Species-specific response of glucosinolate content to elevated atmospheric CO 2 (1997) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 23, pp. 2569-2582; Keeling, C.D., Whorf, T.P., Atmospheric CO 2 records from sites in the SIO air sampling network (2001) Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change, , Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, TN; Lavola, A., Julkunen, R., de la Rosa, T.M., Allocation of carbon to growth and secondary metabolites in birch seedlings under UV-B radiation and CO 2 exposure (2000) Physiologia Plantarum, 109, pp. 260-267; Mayeux, H.S., Johnson, H.B., Polley, H.W., A controlled environment chamber for growing plants across a sub-ambient carbon dioxide gradient (1993) Functional Ecology, 7, pp. 125-133; McCarthy, J.J., Canzian, O.F., Leary, N.A., (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Ohnmeiss, T.E., Baldwin, I.T., Optimal defense theory predicts the ontogeny of an induced nicotine defense (2000) Ecology, 81, pp. 1765-1783; Papadoyannis, I.N., Samanidou, V.F., Stefanidou, P.G., Clinical assay of nicotine and its metabolite, cotinine, in body fluids by HPLC following solid phase extraction (2002) Journal of Liquid Chromatography and Related Technology, 25, pp. 2315-2335; Patterson, D.T., Weeds in a changing climate (1995) Weed Science, 43, pp. 685-701; Raskin, I., Ribnicky, D.M., Komarnytsky, S., Plants and human health in the twenty-first century (2002) Trends in Biotechnology, 20, pp. 522-531; Rezvani, A.H., Levin, E.D., Cognitive effects of nicotine (2001) Social and Biological Psychology, 49, pp. 258-267; Rezvani, A.H., Levin, E.D., Nicotine-alcohol interactions and cognitive function in rats (2002) Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, 72, pp. 865-872; Sage, R.F., Was low atmospheric CO 2 during the Pleistocene a limiting factor for the origin of agriculture?
