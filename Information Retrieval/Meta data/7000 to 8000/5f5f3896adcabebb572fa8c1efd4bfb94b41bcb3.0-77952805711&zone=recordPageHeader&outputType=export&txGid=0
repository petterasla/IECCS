From June 2007 to June 2008, we investigated the annual net production and annual carbon and nitrogen absorptions of Eisenia arborea in the eastern coast of Ise Bay. The annual production in terms of dry weight was estimated by counting the number of new bladelets and was found to be 5.23 d.w.kg m -2y-1. The annual carbon and nitrogen absorptions were estimated by measuring their concentrations in the bladelets; these were found to be 1.13 kgC m-2y-1 and 0.09 kgN m-2y -1. respectively.",,"Eisenia arborea",,,,,,"Japanese sourceJapanese sourceJapanese sourceJapanese sourceJapanese sourceJapanese sourceJapanese sourceJapanese sourceYokohama, Y., Tanaka, J., Chihara, M., Productivity of the Ecklonia cava community in a bay of Izu peninsula on the Pacific coast of Japan (1987) Bot.
