Owing to its flat and low-lying coastal zone, which is experiencing isostatic and tectonic uplift, the development of the coast should be stable, although activation of coastal processes, which are presumed to be associated with global climate change, has been observed in Estonia for the last 20-30 years. As there is little evidence of a sea level rise during this period, extensive erosion and alteration of depositional coasts, such as sandy beaches, appears to be largely due to the recent increased storminess in the eastern Baltic Sea. Frequency of storm days varied greatly during the second half of the 20th century with a minimum in the 1960s and a maximum during the last two decades. The results of the Mann-Kendall test show a statistically significant increasing trend in annual and winter storminess over the last half-century. This increase is probably associated with increased westerlies and cyclonic activity in Northern Atlantic in winter resulting in warmer winters in northern Europe and an ice-free Baltic Sea near the Estonian coast. This paper focuses on the relationships between storm frequency and wind speed and the shoreline dynamics of areas where coastal processes and shoreline development has been observed and recorded for the last 20-30 years. A dataset of storms was created and extremely stormy periods were identified in order to correlate storm data with the most significant recorded coastal change events. The most marked coastal changes in Estonia result from a combination of strong storms, high sea-levels induced by storm surge, ice free seas and unfrozen sediments, all of which enhance erosion and transport of sediments above the mean sea-level and inland the mean coastline.","Baltic Sea; Climate change; Coastal zone of Estonia; Shore erosion; Shore processes","climate change; coastal evolution; shoreline change; Estonia",,,,,,"Alexandersson, H., Tomenvirta, H., Schmith, T., Iden, K., Trends of storms in NW Europe derived from an updated pressure data set (2000) Climate Research, 14, pp. 71-73; Balling, R.C., Vose, R.S., Weber, G.-R., Analysis of long-term European temperature records: 1751-1995 (1998) Climate Research, 10, pp. 193-200; Bijl, W., Flather, R., De Ronde, J.G., Schmith, T., Changing storminess?
