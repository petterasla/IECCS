In order to eliminate known effects of high temperatures on pollen production and stylar position, high temperature treatments were applied only to male-sterile tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Pollen was obtained from male-fertile plants given optimal growth conditions. This allowed comparison of mean daily temperatures from 25-29 C; day/night temperature differentials (DIFs) of 2, 6, and 10 C; day temperatures of 28, 30 and 32 C at night temperatures of 22, 24, and 26 C; and night temperatures of 22, 24 and 26 C at day temperatures of 28, 30 and 32 C. Average weight per fruit and flower number did not demonstrate a consistent pattern of response to high temperature. Other reproductive characteristics (% fruit set, total number and weight of fruit per plant, and seediness index) decreased as mean daily temperature rose from 25 C to 26 C and from 28 C to 29 C. The primary parameter affecting these variables was mean daily temperature, with day temperature having a secondary role. Thus, in determining reproductive responses of tomato to temperatures within this range, day temperature, night temperature and DIFs do not need to be considered independently of their effect on mean daily temperature. If this relationship holds true in other species, and for pre-pollen production processes as well, modelling the effects of projected climate change should be simplified.","Global climate change; ovule development; pollination; stress resistance; thermotolerance",,,,,,,"Abdul-Baki, A.A., Stommel, J.R., Pollen viability and fruitset of tomato genotypes under optimum and high-temperature regimes (1995) HortScience, 30, pp. 115-117; Adams, R.M., Rosenzweig, C., Peart, R.M., Ritchie, J.T., McCarl, B.A., Glyer, J.D., Curry, R.B., Allen Jr., L.H., Global climate change and US agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-224; Adams, R.M., Fleming, R.A., Chang, C.-C., McCarl, B.A., Rosenzweig, C., Economic effects of global climate change on US agriculture (1995) Climatic Change, 30, pp. 147-167; Atherton, J.G., Harris, G.P., Flowering (1986) The Tomato Crop.
