Electricity generation in thermal power plants, as well as other industrial activities, such as chemical and petrochemical ones, entail the emission of pollutants that are harmful to humans, animals and plants. The emissions of carbon oxides (CO and CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are directly related to the greenhouse effect. The negative effects of sulfur oxides (SO2 and SO3 named SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are their contribution to the formation of acid rain and their impacts on human health and on the biota in general. This study intends to evaluate the environmental impacts of the atmospheric pollution resulting from the burning of fossil fuels. This study considers the emissions of CO2, SO x, NOx and PM in an integral way, and they are compared to the international air quality standards that are in force using a parameter called ecological efficiency (ε). © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
