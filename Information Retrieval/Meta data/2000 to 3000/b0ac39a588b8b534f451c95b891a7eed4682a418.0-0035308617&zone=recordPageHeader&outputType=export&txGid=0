The main part of the process was composed of the extraction reaction of Ca ions from calcium silicates by acetic acid, and the crystallization reaction of CaCO3 by CO2 and Ca ion. The CO2 captured from an oil fired thermal power plant was disposed of in the form of CaCO3. The process feasibility was assessed based on the experimental data on the reaction kinetics. The total energy penalty for the treatment operation of CO2 was 20.4 Mw for a 100-Mw thermal power plant.",,,,,,,,,"Yamasaki, A.; Natl.
