Climate change research is largely global in focus, aims at enhanced understanding, and is driven by experts, all of which seem to be insufficient to anchor climate change action in regional and local contexts. We present results from a participatory scenario study conducted in collaboration with the municipality of Delta in SW British Columbia, Canada. This study applies a participatory capacity building approach for climate change action at the local level where the sources of emissions and the mechanisms of adaptation reside and where climate change is meaningful to decision-makers and stakeholders alike. The multi-scale scenario approach consists of synthesizing global climate change scenarios, downscaling them to the regional and local level, and finally visualizing alternative climate scenarios out to 2100 in 3D views of familiar, local places. We critically discuss the scenarios produced and the strengths and weaknesses of the approach applied. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change communication; Decision support; Global to local downscaling; Local climate change impacts and responses; Participatory scenario development; Visualization","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; global climate; local participation; research program; British Columbia; Canada; North America",,,,,,"A Changing Climate For Insurance (2004) A Summary Report for Chief Executives and Policymakers, , www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/553/climatechange2004.pdf, ABI Association of British Insurers, Retrieved September 2006 from; Adger, N., Resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation: a cross-cutting theme of the international human dimensions programme on global environmental change (2006) Global Environmental Change, 6 (3), pp. 268-281; Balmford, A., Manica, A., Airey, L., Birkin, L., Oliver, A., Schleicher, J., Hollywood, climate change and the public (2004) Science, 305, p. 1713; Biggs, R., Raudsepp-Hearne, C., Atkinson-Palombo, C., Bohensky, E., Boyd, E., Cundill, G., Linking futures across scales: a dialog on multiscale scenarios (2007) Ecology and Society, 12 (1), p. 17. , http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol12/iss1/art17/; Bizikova, L., Robinson, J., Cohenv, S., Linking climate change and sustainable development at the local level (2007) Climate Policy, 7, pp. 271-277; Ecosystems and human well-being: scenarios (2005) Findings of the Scenarios Working Group.
