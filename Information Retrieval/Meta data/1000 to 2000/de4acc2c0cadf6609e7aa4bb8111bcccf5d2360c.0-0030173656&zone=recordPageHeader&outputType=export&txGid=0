Already, developed countries have agreed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions so 1990 levels by the year 2000. At the Untied Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), developed countries agreed to meet the incremental costs of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. One possible avenue for effecting the provisions of the FCCC is joint implementation (JI) projects involving developed and developing countries. This article looks at a sample of African countries that are at different levels of development. It identifies resource options that, when used in an integrated resource planning context, prove to be cost effective as well as environmentally benign. It investigates these options, particularly energy efficient appliances and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), in terms of their effects on the planning and operations of electric utilities and on their emission of global warming cases. The authors hope that the article will be helpful in developing criteria for selecting and prioritizing JI projects. It focuses on Africa because it appears that, unlike Asia and Latin America, the least amount of information has been published for this continent in general.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Electric power utilization; Fluorescent lamps; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Planning; Resource valuation; Africa; Compact fluorescent lamps; Greenhouse gas emissions; Integrated resource planning; Energy efficiency",,,,,,"Adegbutugbe, A.O., Energy demand and CO2 reduction options in Nigeria (1991) Energy Policy, 19 (12), pp. 940-945; Adegbulugbe, A.O., Oladosu, G.A., Energy use and CO2 emissions in the West and Central African region (1994) Energy Policy, 22 (6), pp. 499-508; Douglas, J., The cost of greenhouse insurance (1992) Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Journal, (DEC), pp. 26-33; Dutt, G., (1991) Energy End Use - An Environmentally Sound Development Pathway, p. 25. , Asian Development Bank; Ebohon, O.J., Empirical analysis of energy consumption behavior (1992) Energy Policy, 20 (8), pp. 781-796; (1989) Technical Brief: Electric Van and Gasoline Van Emissions: A Comparison, , EPRI; (1991) Technical Brief: Load Management and the Environment, , Rept.
