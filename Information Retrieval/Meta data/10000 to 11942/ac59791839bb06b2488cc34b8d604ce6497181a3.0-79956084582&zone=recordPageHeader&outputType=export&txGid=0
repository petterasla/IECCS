From a purely allocative point of view, transfers supporting mitigation tend to be Pareto-improving whereas this is not very likely in the case of adaptation support. We illustrate this by regarding transfer schemes currently applied under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto framework.However, if we enrich the analysis by integrating distributional aspects, we find that international adaptation funding may help both the developing and developed world. Interestingly this is not due to altruistic incentives, but due to follow-up effects on international negotiations on climate change mitigation. We argue that the lack of fairness perceived by developing countries in the international climate policy arena can be reduced by the support of adaptation in these countries. As we show - taking into account different fairness concepts - this might raise the prospects of success in international negotiations on climate change. Yet, we find that the influence of transfers may induce different fairness effects on climate change mitigation negotiations to run counter.We discuss whether current transfer schemes under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto framework adequately serve the distributive and allocative objectives pursued in international climate policy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Fairness; Global Environmental Facility; International climate policy; Mitigation; Reciprocity; Transfers","developing world; global warming; industrialization; integrated approach; Kyoto Protocol; policy making; pollution policy",,,,,,"Aakre, S., Rübbelke, D.T.G., Adaptation to climate change in the European Union: efficiency vs. equity considerations (2010) Environmental Policy and Governance, 20, pp. 159-179; Aakre, S., Rübbelke, D.T.G., Objectives of public economic policy and the adaptation to climate change (2010) Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 53, pp. 767-791; Adger, W.N., Scales of governance and environmental justice for adaptation and mitigation of climate change (2001) Journal of International Development, 13, pp. 921-931; Adger, W.N., Benjaminsen, T.A., Brown, K., Svarstad, H., Advancing a political ecology of global environmental discourses (2001) Development and Change, 32, pp. 681-715; Althammer, W., Buchholz, W., Lindahl-equilibria as the outcome of a non-cooperative game (1993) European Journal of Political Economy, 9, pp. 399-405; Anantram, K., Noronha, L., (2005), Financing adaptation, Discussion Paper, The Energy and Resource Institute, New DelhiArrow, K.J., Global climate change: a challenge to policy (2007) Economists' Voice, , June; Barrett, S., (2007) Equity, the stern review and what should we do about climate change, contribution to the blog ClimatePolicy.org, , http://www.climatepolicy.org/?p=13, Available online at, An American Meteorological Society Project, Available online at:; Barrett, S., Proposal for a new climate change treaty system (2007) Economists' Voice, , October; Barrett, S., Climate treaties and the imperative of enforcement (2008) Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 24, pp. 239-258; Barrett, S., Dikes v. windmills: climate treaties and adaptation (2008) Paper presented at the workshop 'The Environment, Technology and Uncertainty' of the Ragnar Frisch Centre for Economic Research, Oslo; Bastianoni, S., Pulselli, F.M., Tiezzi, E., The problem of assigning responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions (2004) Ecological Economics, 49, pp. 253-257; Bergstrom, T.C., Blume, L., Varian, H., On the private provision of public goods (1986) Journal of Public Economics, 29, pp. 25-49; Boadway, R., Public economics and the theory of public policy (1997) Canadian Journal of Economics, 30, pp. 753-772; Boadway, R., Song, Z., Tremblay, J.-F., Commitment and matching contributions to public goods (2007) Journal of Public Economics, 91, pp. 1664-1683; Bolton, G.E., Ockenfels, A., A stress test of fairness measures in models of social utility (2005) Economic Theory, 25, pp. 957-982; Buchholz, W., Konrad, K.A., Strategic transfers and private provision of public goods (1995) Journal of Public Economics, 57, pp. 489-505; Buchholz, W., Cornes, R.C., Rübbelke, D.T.G., ""Interior matching equilibria in a public good economy: an aggregative game approach"" (2011) Journal of Public Economics, 95, pp. 639-645; Burton, I., Diringer, E., Smith, J., (2006) Adaptation to Climate Change: International Policy Options, , PEW Center on Global Climate Change, Arlington; Camerer, C.F., Progress in behavioral game theory (1997) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 11, pp. 167-188; Camerer, C.F., Thaler, R.H., ""In honor of Matthew Rabin: winner of the John Bates Clark Medal (2003) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 17, pp. 159-176; Campbell-Lendrum, D., Woodruff, R., Climate change: quantifying the health impact at national and local levels (2007) WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series No. 14, , World Health Organization, Geneva, A.
