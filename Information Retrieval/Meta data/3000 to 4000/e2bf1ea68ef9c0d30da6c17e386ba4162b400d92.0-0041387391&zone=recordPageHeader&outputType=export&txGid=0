Validation of the model with the observed data indicated that the model can simulate both the crop growth processes and emissions of CH4 and N2O accurately. Some numerical analyses were made to identify the impacts of different fertilizer application on assimilation of CO2 and emissions of CH4 and N2O, and the transformation principle of the composite global warming potential. Based on the results of the numerical analysis, the source-sink alternation of composite global warming potential in the paddy ecosystem was discovered, and some new conceptions of fertilizer index such as maximum-sink fertilizer, zero-emission fertilizer are put forward in this paper. The fertilizer scheme for Yangtze Delta was proposed to provide the important scientific basis for a sustainable agriculture in this region.","Global warming potential; Numerical simulation; Paddy ecosystem","Crops; Data acquisition; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Source-sink alternation; Global warming; biogeochemical cycle; crop; ecosystem; global warming; numerical model; paddy field; China",,,,,,"(1995) Climate Change 1994, 73. , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; (1992) Climate Change: The IPCC 1990 and 1992 Assessments, 64. , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Zhang, R., Sun, X., Zhu, Z., A remote sensing model of CO2 flux for wheat and studying of regional distribution (1999) Science in China, 42, p. 325. , Ser.
