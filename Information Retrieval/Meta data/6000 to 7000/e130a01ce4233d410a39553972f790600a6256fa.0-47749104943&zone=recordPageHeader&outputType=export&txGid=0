The fraction of the U.S. population living in high-risk zones for nephrolithiasis will grow from 40% in 2000 to 56% by 2050, and to 70% by 2095. Predictions based on a climate model of intermediate severity warming (SRESa1b) indicate a climate-related increase of 1.6 -2.2 million lifetime cases of nephrolithiasis by 2050, representing up to a 30% increase in some climate divisions. Nationwide, the cost increase associated with this rise in nephrolithiasis would be $0.9-1.3 billion annually (year-2000 dollars), representing a 25% increase over current expenditures. The impact of these changes will be geographically concentrated, depending on the precise relationship between temperature and stone risk. Stone risk may abruptly increase at a threshold temperature (nonlinear model) or increase steadily with temperature change (linear model) or some combination thereof. The linear model predicts increases by 2050 that are concentrated in California, Texas, Florida, and the Eastern Seaboard; the nonlinear model predicts concentration in a geographic band stretching from Kansas to Kentucky and Northern California, immediately south of the threshold isotherm. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate change; Epidemiology; Kidney stone; Medicine; Urology","article; climate; greenhouse effect; health care cost; human; prevalence; priority journal; risk assessment; temperature dependence; United States; urolithiasis; Climate; Cost of Illness; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Models, Biological; Prevalence; Risk; Temperature; United States; Urolithiasis",,,,,,"Pearle, M.S., Calhoun, E.A., Curhan, G.C., Urologic Diseases in America project: Urolithiasis (2005) J Urol, 173, pp. 848-857; Stamatelou, K.K., Francis, M.E., Jones, C.A., Curhan, G.C., Time trends in reported prevalence of kidney stones in the United States: 1976-1994 (2003) Kidney Int, 63, pp. 1817-1823; Soucie, J.M., Coates, R., McClellan, W., Austin, H., Thun, M., Relation between geographic variability in kidney stones prevalence and risk factors for stones (1996) Am J Epidemiol, 143, pp. 487-495; Chen, Y.-Y., Roseman, J.M., DeVivo, M.J., Huang, C.-T., Geographic variation and environmental risk factors for the incidence of initial kidney stones in patients with spinal cord injury (2000) J Urol, 164, pp. 21-26; Trinchieri, A., Increase in the prevalence of symptomatic upper urinary tract stones during the past 10 years (2000) Eur Urol, 37, pp. 23-25; Yoshida, O., Okada, Y., Epidemiology of urolithiasis in Japan: A chronological and geographical study (1990) Urol Int, 45, pp. 104-111; Clark, J.Y., Renal calculi in army aviators (1990) Aviation Space Environ Med, 61, pp. 744-747; Cramer, J.S., Forrest, K., Renal lithiasis: Addressing the risks of austere desert deployments (2006) Aviation Space Environ Med, 77, pp. 649-653; Pierce, L.W., Bloom, B., Observations on urolithiasis among American troops in a desert area (1945) J Urol, 54, pp. 466-470; al Hadramy, M.S., Seasonal variations of urinary stone colic in Arabia (1997) J Pakistan Med Assoc, 47, pp. 281-284; Robertson, W.G., Peacock, M., Marshall, R.W., Speed, R., Nordin, B.E., Seasonal variations in the composition of urine in relation to calcium stone-formation (1975) Clin Sci Mol Med, 49, pp. 597-602; Elliott Jr, J.P., Gordon, J.O., Evans, J.W., Platt, L., A stone season: A 10-year retrospective study of 768 surgical stone cases with respect to seasonal variation (1975) J Urol, 114, pp. 574-577; Bateson, E.M., Renal tract calculi and climate (1973) Med J Aust, 2, pp. 111-113; Chen, Y.-K., Lin, H.-C., Chen, C.-S., Yeh, S.-D., Seasonal variations in urinary calculi attacks and their association with climate: A population-based study (2008) J Urol, 179, pp. 564-569; Evans, K., Costabile, R.A., Time to development of symptomatic urinary calculi in a high-risk environment (2005) J Urol, 173, pp. 858-861; IPCC, (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Summary for Policymakers.
