This paper investigates the impact of high-research-octane-number (RON) fuels on engine thermal efficiency. It is shown that the lean boosted engine has higher potential to increase engine thermal efficiency than naturally aspirated (NA) engines and the combination of lean boosted engine and high-RON fuels gives around 44 per cent engine thermal efficiency. The engine thermal efficiency exceeds a diesel engine's thermal efficiency. Therefore, the combination is expected to be an effective way to reduce CO2 emissions in the future.In this paper, the high-RON fuels are blended with gasoline components or bio-components. This paper also describes the combustion characteristics of ethanol and butanol. These fuels have good combustion features after the engine has warmed up. However, it is found that butanol gives more severe combustion characteristics under cold conditions. © Authors 2011.","Bio-fuel; Gasoline engine; High boost; Lean burn; Octane index; Thermal efficiency","Gasoline engine; High boost; Lean burn; Octane index; Thermal efficiency; Alcohols; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Ethanol; Fuels; Gasoline; Global warming; Engines",,,,,,"Caris, D.F., Mitchell, B.J., Muduffie, A.D., Wyczalek, F.A., Mechanical octanes for higher efficiency (1956) Trans.
