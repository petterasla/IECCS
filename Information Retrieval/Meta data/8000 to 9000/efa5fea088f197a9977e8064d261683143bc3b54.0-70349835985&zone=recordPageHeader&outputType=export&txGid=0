TG during pre-monsoon (March to May) is reducing at a significant rate of 0.036°/year (Arabian Sea) and 0.030°/year (Bay of Bengal). The above alarming results are based on sixty years (1948-2007) of daily temperature and wind data extracted from CDAS-NCEP/NCAR reanalysis datasets. TG based on ERA-40 data also indicates a decreasing trend of 0.0229°/year and 0.0397°/year for Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal respectively. As TG is not governed by any type of significant oscillation, there is a possibility of TG tending to zero. It is further observed that the rate of warming over the oceans is more than that over the land which has resulted into the weakening of TG. Pre-monsoon TG has significant correlations with • All India Seasonal Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR), • kinetic energy of waves 1 and 2 at 850 hPa, • kinetic energy, and • stream function at 850 hPa over Indian landmass during monsoon season. Except AISMR, the decreasing trends observed in all the above parameters are significant. All India rainfall for July and August together shows a significant decreasing trend of 0.995 mm/year. Reducing number of depressions and cyclonic storms and increasing number of break days during monsoon over India are the reflections of the weakening of TG. © Printed in India.","Monsoon; Pre-monsoon; Temperature gradient; Weakening","air temperature; atmospheric wave; climate oscillation; global warming; kinetic energy; monsoon; storm; temperature gradient; trend analysis; troposphere; wind; Arabian Sea; Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean",,,,,,"Bawiskar, S.M., Chipade, M.D., Puranik, Energetics of lower tropospheric ultra long waves; A key to intraseasonal variability of Indian monsoon (2009) J.
