It is in this context that this work attempts to forecast India's possible energy demands and emissions adopting a key indicator approach on least cost generation expansion optimization methodology for a long time frame. This study developed key indicators for useful-energy demand for end-use sectors such as industry, commerce, and residence. Key indicators for transport sector and non-energy use sectors were developed on transport mobility demand and end-use fuel demand. The main drivers of these key indicators are socio-economic parameters. This work was conducted in a linear programmed (LP) TIMES G5 model on TIMES modeling framework for model horizon of 1990-2100. By the end of the 21st-century, India's energy demands are projected to be about 1825Mtoe of primary energy, 1263Mtoe of final energy consumption, 4840TWh of electricity generations, 723Mtoe of energy import, and 4414Mt of CO2 emissions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Emission; Energy demand; Energy indicator","Electricity generation; End-use sectors; End-uses; Energy demands; Energy imports; Energy indicator; Energy security; Final energy; Fuel demand; Generation expansion; Global climate changes; International policies; Key indicator; Least cost; Local environments; Modeling frameworks; Non-energy use; Optimization methodology; Primary energies; Socio-economics; Time frame; Transport mobility; Transport sectors; Carbon dioxide; Electric generators; Energy utilization; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; demand analysis; electricity generation; emission inventory; energy efficiency; energy market; energy planning; forecasting method; local government; optimization; twenty first century; India",,,,,,"(1985), ABE, Government of India: Towards a Perspective on Energy Demand and Supply in India in 2004/2005.
