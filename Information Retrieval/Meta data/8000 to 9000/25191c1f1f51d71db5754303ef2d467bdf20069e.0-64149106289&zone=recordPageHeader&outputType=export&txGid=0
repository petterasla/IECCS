The experiments were performed in bypass channels of the River Rhine (Cologne, Germany) in which temperature could be manipulated. 2. The impact of temperature increase on CRs depends upon the grazer: E. muelleri showed a clear increase in CRs with increasing temperature whereas P. emarginata was not significantly affected by experimental warming. 3. Distinct differences in food preference were found for the sponge (which is an efficient grazer of bacteria and small algae) and for the bryozoan P. emarginata (which feeds primarily on large algae, and with no significant grazing on bacteria). 4. In contrast to their temperature-related patterns in CR, respiration of both P. emarginata and E. muelleri increased with temperature between 19 and 32 °C, suggesting that the risk of experiencing energy deficiency at high temperatures due to increased metabolic rates is particularly high for the bryozoan. 5. A temperature elevation of 3 °C above the natural Rhine temperature resulted in a delay in the disappearance of active tissue and formation of resting stages for E. muelleri in autumn. This delay ranged from 8 (beginning of gemmulation) to 22 days (termination of gemmulation). In contrast, there was no distinct effect of warming on the disappearance of active zooids of the two bryozoan species in autumn. However, warming can positively affect the maintenance of active zooids during winter in F. sultana. In spring, the appearance of active zooids of P. emarginata was clearly stimulated by temperature elevations, whereas the hatching of both F. sultana and E. muelleri was hardly affected by warming. 6. The study demonstrated different patterns in the thermal ecology of the two freshwater bryozoans and the sponge in comparison to other filter feeders, particularly mussels. Such patterns need to be considered when predicting the impact of temperature on pelagic-benthic coupling in aquatic habitats. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bryozoans; Global warming; Grazing; Phenology; Sponges","algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bryozoa; Ephydatia muelleri; Fredericella sultana; Phylactolaemata; Plumatella emarginata; Spongillidae",,,,,,"Ackerman, J.D., Effect of velocity on the filter feeding of dreissenid mussls (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis): Implications for trophic dynamics (1999) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 47, pp. 1437-1450; Adrian, R., Wilhelm, S., Gerten, D., Life-history traits of lake plankton species may govern their phenological response to climate warming (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 652-661; Aldridge, D.W., Payne, B.S., Miller, A.C., Oxygen consumption, nitrogenous excretion, and filtration rates of Dreissena polymorpha at acclimation temperatures between 20 an 32 °c (1995) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 52, pp. 1761-1767; Benfey, T.J., Reiswig, H.M., Temperature, pH, and photoperiod effects upon gemmule hatching in the freshwater sponge, Ephydatia muelleri (Porifera, Spongillidae) (1982) Journal of Experimental Zoology, 221, pp. 13-21; Brown, S.A., Ruxton, G.D., Pickup, R.W., Humphries, S., Seston capture by Hydropsyche siltalai and the accuracy of capture efficiency estimates (2005) Freshwater Biology, 50, pp. 113-126; Callaghan, T.P., Karlson, R.H., Summer dormancy as a refuge from mortality in the freshwater bryozoan Plumatella emarginata (2002) Oecologia, 132, pp. 51-59; Cohen, R.R.H., Dresler, P.V., Phillips, E.J.P., Cory, R.L., The effect of the Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea, on phytoplankton of the Potomac River, Maryland (1984) Limnology and Oceanography, 29, pp. 170-180; Descy, J.P., Everbecq, E., Gosselein, V., Viroux, L., Smitz, J.S., Modelling the impact of benthic filter-feeders on the composition and biomass of river plankton (2003) Freshwater Biology, 48, pp. 404-417; Dröscher, I., Waringer, J., Abundance and microhabitats of freshwater sponges (Spongillidae) in a Danubean floodplain in Austria (2007) Freshwater Biology, 52, pp. 998-1008; Duckworth, A.R., Bruck, W.M., Janda, K.E., Pitts, T.P., McCarthy, P.J., Retention efficiencies of the coral reef sponges Aplysina lacunosa, Callyspongia vaginalis and Niphates digitalis determinated by Coulter counter and plate culture analysis (2006) Marine Biology Research, 2, pp. 243-248; Fell, P.E., Deep diapause and the influence of low-temperature on the hatching of the gemmules of Spongilla lacustris (L) and Eunapius fragilis (Leidy) (1995) Invertebrate Biology, 114, pp. 3-8; Fesl, C., Humpesch, U.H., Wöss, E.R., Biodiversität des Makrozoobenthos der österreichischen Donau unter Berücksichtigung quantitativer Befunde der freien Fließstrecke unterhalb Wiens (2005) Denisia 16; Kataloge der Oberösterreichischen Landesmuseen, 28, pp. 139-158; Frost, T.M., In situ measurements of clearance rates for the freshwater sponge Spongilla lacustris (1978) Limnology and Oceanography, 23, pp. 1034-1039; Frost, T.M., Clearance rate determination for the freshwater sponge Spongilla lacustris: Effects of temperature, particle type and concentration, and sponge size (1980) Archiv für Hydrobiologie, 90, pp. 330-356; Gaino, E., Rebora, M., Corallini, C., Lancioni, T., The life-cycle of the sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis (L.) living on the reed Phragmites australis in an artificially regulated lake (2003) Hydrobiologia, 495, pp. 127-142; Gillooly, J.F., Brown, J.H., West, G.B., Savage, V.M., Charnov, E.L., Effects of size and temperature on metabolic rate (2001) Science, 293, pp. 2248-2251; Gugel, J., High abundance of Trochospongilla horrida (Porifera, Spongillidae) in the Rhine (Germany) 1992-1995 (2000) Hydrobiologia, 421, pp. 199-207; (2007) Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
