However, due to the long atmospheric lifetimes and high global warming potentials of PFCs, the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) agreed in 1999 to reduce emissions by up to 90% by 2010. Emission reduction targets are based on the mass carbon equivalent (CE) of PFC gases emitted in a given region. For Europe, US and Japan, PFC emissions must be reduced 10% below the 1995 emission baseline by 2010. For Korea, the baseline year is 1997 and for Taiwan, it is 1998. This study shows that a combination of process improvements as well as abatement actions can reduce PFC emissions and increase productivity and cost savings.",,"Carbon equivalent (CE); PFC emissions; World Semiconductor Council (WSC); Air pollution; Carbon; Global warming; Particulate emissions; Semiconductor materials",,,,,,"2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 3. , http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/ppd.htm, Chap. 6 semiconductor industry emissions; Kesari, S., Process Optimization and PFC Emission Reduction Using C3F8 Chamber Clean Processes in AMAT P-5000 PECVD Tools (1999) Environmental Issues in the Electronics and Semiconductor Industries, Proc. of the 2nd International Symp.
