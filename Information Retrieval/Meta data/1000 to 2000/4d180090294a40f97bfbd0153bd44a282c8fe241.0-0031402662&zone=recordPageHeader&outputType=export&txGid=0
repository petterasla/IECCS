The mass balance is modelled by the degree-day method and the energy-balance method. The lithosphere is considered to respond isostatically to a point load and the time evolution of the bedrock follows from a viscous asthenosphere. According to the IPCC-IS92a scenario (with constant aerosols after 1990) the Greenland ice-sheet is likely to cause a global sea level rise of 10.4 cm by 2100 AD. It is shown, however, that the result is sensitive to precise model formulations and that simplifications as used in the sea-level projection in the IPCC-96 report yield less accurate results. Our model results indicate that, on a time scale of a hundred years, including the dynamic response of the ice-sheet yields more mass loss than the fixed response in which changes in geometry are not incorporated. It appears to be important to consider sliding, as well as the fact that climate sensitivity increases for larger perturbations. Variations in predicted sea-level change on a time scale of hundred years depend mostly on the initial state of the ice-sheet. On a time scale of a few hundred years, however, the variability in the predicted melt is dominated by the variability in the climate scenarios.",,"global warming; ice sheet; Greenland",,,,,,"Cadee, M., (1992) Numerical Modelling of the Greenland Ice Sheet, Application of a Two-dimensional Ice Flow Model (in Dutch), , IMAU Int Rep V92-10; De Wolde, J.R., Bintanja, R., Oerlemans, J., On the thermal expansion over the last hundred years (1995) J Clim (in Press); Dibb, J.E., The accumulation of 210Pb at Summit.
