We consider three cases: 'selfish,' in which region 1 controls optimally given its own damage costs and region 2 does not control; 'altruistic,' in which region 1 controls optimally given total worldwide damage costs while region 2 does not control; and 'optimal,' in which regions 1 and 2 exercise jointly optimal control of emissions and region 1 pays region 2 to participate. We find that neither region gains much in the selfish case; but both regions are better off in the optimal case than in the altruistic case, though region 1's benefits are negative in both these cases. © 1995.","Economic assessment; Global warming; International cooperation","carbon dioxide emission; CETA model; economic assessment; economic evaluation; emission control; global warming; international cooperation; modelling approach",,,,,,"Cline, (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC; Dickinson, Cicerone, Future global warming from atmospheric trace gases (1986) Nature, 319 (9), pp. 109-115; Energy Modeling Forum, Study design for EMF12 global climate change: energy sector impacts of greenhouse gas emission control strategies (1991) Draft, Energy Modeling Forum, , Stanford University, Stanford, CA; Fulkerson, Judkins, Sanghvi, Energy from fossil fuels (1990) Scientific American, pp. 128-135. , September; Hoel, Intertemporal properties of an international carbon tax (1993) Resource and Energy Economics, 15 (1), pp. 51-70; IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Meteorological Office, Bracknell, Report prepared for IPCC by Working Group I; Maier-Reimer, Hasselmann, Transport and storage of CO2 in the ocean — an inorganic ocean-circulation carbon cycle model (1987) Climate Dynamics, 2, pp. 63-90; Manne, Richels, (1992) Buying Greenhouse Insurance: The Economic Costs of CO2 Emission Limits, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; National Academy of Sciences, (1991) Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming, , National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Nordhaus, Contribution of different greenhouse gases to global warming: a new technique for measuring impact (1990) Draft, , Department of Economics, Yale University, New Haven, CT; Nordhaus, To slow or not to slow the economics of the greenhouse effect (1991) The Economic Journal, 101; Nordhaus, Rolling the DICE: an optimal transition path for controlling greenhouse gases (1993) Resource and Energy Economics, 15 (1), pp. 27-50; Nordhaus, Optimal greenhouse-gas reductions and tax policy in the DICE model (1993) American Economic Review, 83 (2), pp. 313-317; Nordhaus, Expert opinion on climate change (1994) American Scientist, 82. , January–February; Parson, Zeckhauser, Cooperation in the unbalanced commons (1992) Draft, , Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge, MA; Peck, Teisberg, CETA a model for carbon emissions trajectory assessment (1992) The Energy Journal, 13 (1), pp. 55-77; Peck, Teisberg, The importance of non-linearities in global warming damage costs (1993) Assessing Surprises and Nonlinearities in Greenhouse Warming, , J Darmstadter, M Toman, Resources for the Future, Washington, DC; Peck, Teisberg, CO2 emissions control: comparing policy instruments (1993) Energy Policy, 21 (3), pp. 222-230; Peck, Teisberg, Global warming uncertainties and the value of information: an analysis using CETA (1993) Resource and Energy Economics, 15 (1), pp. 71-97; Schlesinger, Jiang, Simple model representation of atmosphere-ocean GCMs and estimation of the time scale of CO2-induced climate change (1990) Journal of Climate, 3, pp. 1297-1315; Wuebbles, Edmonds, (1988) A Primer on Greenhouse Gases, , US Department of Energy, Washington, DC, DOE/NBB-0083","Peck, S.C.; Electric Power Research Institute, PO Box 10412, Palo Alto, CA 94303, United States",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029507787
