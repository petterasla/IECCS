The study is important for the development of efficient water resource management systems and validation of climate change impact models. The application of the Mann-Kendall test reveals that a significant increasing trend in winter air temperature and precipitation was determined for all 3 investigated periods (1923 - 2003, 1941 - 2003 and 1961 - 2003). The same trend was found for the winter and annual discharge time series. No trend was observed for the spring, summer and autumn seasonal streamflow and summer low flow series for most of the Baltic region. In general the relation between the main meteorological and hydrological parameters and the tendency in river discharge trends is common for all of the Baltic States, and might be associated with the regional impacts of global climate change. © IWA Publishing 2007.","Baltic States; Climate change; Long-term variability; River discharge trends","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Computer simulation; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Precipitation (meteorology); Statistical methods; Mann-Kendall test; River discharge; Rivers; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; long-term change; precipitation (climatology); resource management; river discharge; water resource; Baltic States; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe",,,,,,"Aleksandersson, H., Moberg, A., Homogenization of Swedish temperature data.
