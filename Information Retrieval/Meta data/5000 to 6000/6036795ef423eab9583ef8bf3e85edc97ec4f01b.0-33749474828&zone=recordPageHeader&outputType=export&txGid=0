The persistent issue of ozone and global warming has led to interest in natural refrigerants, such as ammonia, which has played a prominent role in the refrigeration industry for years, particularly in the fields of food, beverage, and marine. The United States food industry has almost exclusively used ammonia as a refrigerant of choice thus far. Therefore, in view of the present situation as well as the future of the air-conditioning and refrigeration industries, it is important to study the role of enhanced heat transfer technology as applied to natural refrigerants. This paper presents an overview of the status of ammonia as a refrigerant of the past, present, and future and what has been done and what ought to be done in order to make ammonia equipment more safer, compact, and attractive so it can be readily accepted by the general public. © 2006 by Begell House, Inc.",,"Air conditioning industry; Ammonia equipment; Refrigeration industry; Air conditioning; Ammonia; Food products; Global warming; Industrial refrigeration; Heat transfer",,,,,,"Ayub, Z.H., Al-Fahed, S.F., The effect of gap width between horizontal tube and twisted tape on the pressure drop in turbulent water flow (1993) Int.
