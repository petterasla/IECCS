A fundamental issue in WP related studies is to locate its centroid and track its trajectory. The method used by some previous researchers for estimating the WP position seems to oversimplify the problem to a purely geometric one. This, however, is found to be systematically biased in both zonal and meridional directions. A new scheme for determining the WP centroid, which takes into account the thermal structure of the surface water, is proposed, resulting in a significant improvement in precise tracking of the WP trajectory compared to previous results. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.","Sea surface temperature; Thermal centroid; Warm pool","sea surface temperature; warm pool",,,,,,"Bates, J.J., Diaz, H.F., Reynolds, R.W., Bernstein, R.L., Using satellite infrared data in studies of variabilities of the western Pacific warm pool (1993) Science, 262, pp. 440-441; Cane, M., Oceanographic events during El Nino (1983) Science, 222, pp. 1189-1195; Chen, G., Fang, C., Zhang, C., Chen, Y., Observing the coupling effect between warm pool and 'rain pool' in the tropical Pacific (2004) Remote Sens.
