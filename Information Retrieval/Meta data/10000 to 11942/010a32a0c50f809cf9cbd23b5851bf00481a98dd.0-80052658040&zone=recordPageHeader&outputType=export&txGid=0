Biofuel has attracted the attention of researchers all over the world due to reducing the environmental impacts of elevated carbon monoxide. Abundant of fruits waste can be reused in the bioethanol production. Hence, it can reduce pollution and waste material, thus, helps in waste disposal management and reducing global warming. The aim of the study of producing bioethanol from rotten rambutan was to manage rambutan wastes, cleaning the environment and reduction of greenhouse gases and global warming. This study was conducted from rambutan fruit waste biomass in different parameters using yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) fermentation. The optimum condition of bioethanol yield was having 3 g of yeast at 30°C by following pH 6 for two days of incubation. Glucose content, total soluble solid (TSS) and pH values reduced after fermentation due to the conversion of glucose to ethanol and carbon dioxide in case of all parameters. The chemical content, viscosity and acid values of the bioethanol produced were within ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standard specifications with less hazardous chemical content in produced bioethanol. Furthermore, the engine test result showed that greenhouse gas emission like hydrocarbon (HC), NOx and SO 2 content in E5 and E10 were significantly lower in bioethanol than in 100% gasoline tested in (proton Gen 2 multicylinder) car. Thus, it can potentially be used as good biofuel for petrol engine purposes. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Bioethanol; Emission; Fruit waste; Global warming; Renewable energy","alcohol; biofuel; carbon dioxide; glucose; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; article; biofuel production; biomass; chemical composition; cleaning; controlled study; fermentation technique; fruit; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; incubation temperature; incubation time; nonhuman; pH; rambutan; renewable energy; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; viscosity; waste management; Nephelium lappaceum; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5",,,,"(2009) Advantages and Disadvantages of Biofuels, , http://www.buzzle.com/articles/advantages-and-disadvantages-ofbiofuels.html, Buzzle; (2009), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambutan, WikipediaHossain, A.B.M.S., Abu Saleh, A., Salleh, A.N., Boyce, P., Prothim Naquidin, M., Bioethanol production from agricultural waste biomass as a renewable bioenergy resource in biomaterials (2008) (Proceeding).
