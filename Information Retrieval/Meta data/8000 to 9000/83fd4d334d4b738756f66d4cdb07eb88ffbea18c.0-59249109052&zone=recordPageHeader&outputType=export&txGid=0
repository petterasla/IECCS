One promising approach is to use hexagonal arrays of infrared heaters such as described by [Kimball, B.A., Conley, M.M., Wang, S., Lin, X., Luo, C., Morgan, J., Smith, D., 2008. Infrared heater arrays for warming ecosystem field plots. Global Change Biology 14, 309-320]. However, their plots were only 3 m in diameter (7.1 m 2), which limits the stature of vegetation to shorter than about 1 m and also limits the amount of plant material that can destructively harvested. Therefore, we tested a larger hexagonal 5-m diameter array of infrared heaters, which provided a near tripling of useable area (19.6 m 2). The number of heaters was tripled from 6 to 18, and their height above the vegetative (wheat) canopy was scaled with the diameter (0.4 times diameter = 2.0 m). Distributions of down-going thermal radiation and of the resultant warming of the vegetation were quite uniform across the plot. Moreover, the same equation previously determined from 3-m diameter plots to describe the thermal radiation efficiency as a function of wind speed was still applicable. Thus, no problems were encountered in tripling the area of the infrared heater-warmed plots.","Canopy temperature; Climate change; Ecosystems; Global change; Global warming; Infrared heater; Thermal radiation","air temperature; experimental study; global change; global warming; heating; infrared radiation; warming; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"IPCC, (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
