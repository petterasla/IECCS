Therefore, exploring environmentally friendly water-saving irrigation strategies is essential for achieving food and environmental security. In northern Ethiopia, where traditional furrow irrigation is widely practiced, water mismanagement and its undesirable environmental impact are rampant.A2-year field study was undertaken tocompare the traditional irrigation management with surge and deficit irrigation practices on a Vertisol plot. Result:Results have shown that surge and deficit irrigation practices increase water productivity by 62% and 58%, respectively, when compared to traditional management. The study also found out that these practices reduce the adverse environmental impacts (water logging and salinity) of traditional management by minimizing deep percolation and tail water losses. Total irrigation depth was reduced by 12% (for surge) and 27% (for deficit) when compared to traditional management. Conclusion: Based on the results, the study concluded that surge and deficit irrigation technologies not only improve water productivity but also enhance environmental sustainability. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.","Irrigation; Sustainability; Vertisols; Water productivity","water; article; chemistry; climate; comparative study; crop; developing country; environmental protection; Ethiopia; growth, development and aging; irrigation (agriculture); maize; methodology; salinity; soil; time; Agricultural Irrigation; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Developing Countries; Ethiopia; Salinity; Soil; Time Factors; Water; Zea mays",,"water, 7732-18-5; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"(2009) Climate and Socio-economic Scenarios For Global-Scale Climate Change Impacts Assessments, , UNEP, United Nations Environmental Program, Nairobi; Brekke, L.D., Kiang, J.E., Olsen, J.R., Pulwarty, R.S., Raff, D.A., Turnipseed, D.P., Climate change and water resources management: A federal perspective (2009) US Geological Survey, Circular, p. 1331; Liu, F., Irrigation strategies for sustainable environmental and human health under climate change (2009) J Earth Environ Sci, 6, pp. 10-13; Instruments related to the United Nations framework convention on climate change and their potential for sustainable forest management in Africa (2003) Forests and Climate Change Working, 1. , FAO; Climate change: Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (2007) Contributions of Working Group II to The Fourth Assessment Report of The Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change, , IPCC Report, Parry ML, Canziani OF, Palutikof JP, van der Linden JP and Hanson CE.
