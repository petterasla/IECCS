The magnitude and characteristics of the change in climate and its effects on human activities and unmanaged ecosystems are highly uncertain, potentially catastrophic, and nearly irreversible on human time scales. Nevertheless, the precautionary principle adds little to benefit-cost analysis for evaluating climate policies. Benefit-cost analysis can incorporate aversion to uncertainty about future outcomes, and also provides a method for balancing this concern against concern for uncertain near-term policy costs. The policies favored by setting constraints on future outcomes, such as atmospheric stabilization and tolerable windows, may be less precautionary than the policies favored by benefit-cost analysis, as benefit-cost analysis can more readily accommodate concerns for moderate as well as severe harms. Concerns about possible climate catastrophes can also be incorporated in benefit-cost analysis and, in any event, may have limited implications for policy choice. © 2000 by ASP.",,,,,,,,"Broome, J., (1992) Counting the Cost of Global Warming, , Cambridge, The White Horse Press; Dowlatabadi, H., Climate change thresholds and guardrails for emissions (1999) Climatic Change, 41, pp. 297-301; Hammitt, J.K., Evaluation endpoints and climate policy: Atmospheric stabilization, benefit-cost analysis, and near-term greenhouse-gas emissions (1999) Climatic Change, 41, pp. 447-468; Hammitt, J.K., Lempert, R.J., Schlesinger, M.E., A sequential-decision strategy for abating climate change (1992) Nature, 357, pp. 315-318; Technical summary (1996) Climate Change 1995: the Science of Climate Change, pp. 9-49. , Houghton, J.T., Meira Filho, L.G., Callander, B.A., Harris, N., Kattenberg, A., and Maskell, K., Eds..
