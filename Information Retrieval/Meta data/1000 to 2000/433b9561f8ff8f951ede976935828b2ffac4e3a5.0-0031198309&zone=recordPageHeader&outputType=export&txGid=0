These are toxic gases that adversely affect the eyes and lungs, contribute to acid rain and global warming and are precursors to ground level ozone formation and photochemical fog. European Council Directive 96/61/EC of September 1996 (IPPC) requires the glass industry (amongst others) to define Best Available Techniques for controlling the main polluting substances. The present paper categorises the various NOx reduction techniques in terms of effectiveness, costs and environmental impact.",,"Air pollution control; Environmental impact; Gaseous effluents; Glass furnaces; Glass manufacture; Nitrogen oxides; Toxicity; Gaseous pollutants; Toxic gases; Industrial emissions",,,,,,"(1953) Interim Report of Committee on Air Pollution; (1996) Combustion et Procedes Industriels Comment Reduire Les Emissions d'Oxides d'Azote, , Angers, France, 25/26 September organised by ADEME","Quirk, R.; Pilkington UK Limited, Prescott Road, St Helens, Merseyside WA10 3TT, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,00171050,,GLSTA,,"English","Glass Technol",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031198309
