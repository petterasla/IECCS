As a core research organization for the purpose of tackling the growing threat the global environment problems, the research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) was established. In Japan many national laboratories, universities and private companies research new technologies and develop new process for mitigating global warming. The present status of the research and development on CO2 removal and disposal technologies in Japan is described. © 1992.","Carbon dioxide removal; global warming; Japan; research & development; technological option",,,,,,,"AIST/MITI, (1991) Guide book of Agency of Industrial Science and Technology; Government of Japan, (1990) The Council of Ministers for Global Environments Conservation, Action Program to Arrest Global Warming; Government of Japan, (1991) The Council of Ministers for Global Environments Conservation, General Plans on the Conservation of Global Environments for the 1991 Fiscal Year; MITI, (1991) General Plans of MITI on the Conservation of Global Environments; MOE, (1991) Summary of Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research, , Ministry of Education; RITE, (1990) Guide book of Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth; STA, (1991) Green Planet Project, , Science and Technology Agency; STA, (1991) Science & Technology in Japan, 10 (36), p. 45","Shindo, Y.; National Chemical Laboratory for Industry, AIST, MITI, Tsukuba, 305, Japan",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
