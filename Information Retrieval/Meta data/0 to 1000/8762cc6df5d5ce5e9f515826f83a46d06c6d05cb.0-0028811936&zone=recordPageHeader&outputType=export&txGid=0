The present paper aims, rather, to emphasize the physical processes related to the role of volcanoes in the global climate change. In particular, the actual time-varying role of volcanoes has to be assessed in the degassing process of the Earth. Some relevant information can be got from the past (historic and palaeontological), for envisaging what should be monitored by satellite at present. © 1995.",,"climate change; degassing; monitoring; remote sensing; volcano",,,,,,"Mouginis-Mark, Pieri, Francis, Volcanoes (1993) Atlas of satellite observations related to global change, p. 341. , R.J.
