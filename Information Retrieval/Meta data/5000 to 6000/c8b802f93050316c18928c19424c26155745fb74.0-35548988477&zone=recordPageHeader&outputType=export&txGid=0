Given the high costs and unproven reliability of immature integrated gasification combined-cycle technology - the basis of what are essentially 600-Mw coal ""refineries"" - conventional pulverized-coal plants will have to carry the capacity ball until 2015. According to David Saggau, president and CEO of Great River Energy, though wind turbines are more efficient today than they were 10 yr ago, 100 Mw of wind still requires backup by 100 Mw of a more-reliable type of generation. The fact that the source of wind energy is ""indigenous"", wind potentially reduces energy imports.",,,,,,,,,"Pearl Street Inc.United States",,,,,,,,00325929,,,,"English","Power",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-35548988477
