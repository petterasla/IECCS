However, the magnitude of this effect is uncertain and critically dependent on how the decomposition of soil organic C (heterotrophic respiration) responds to changes in climate. Previous studies with the Hadley Centre's coupled climate-carbon cycle general circulation model (GCM) (HadCM3LC) used a simple, single-pool soil carbon model to simulate the response. Here we present results from numerical simulations that use the more sophisticated 'RothC' multipool soil carbon model, driven with the same climate data. The results show strong similarities in the behaviour of the two models, although RothC tends to simulate slightly smaller changes in global soil carbon stocks for the same forcing. RothC simulates global soil carbon stocks decreasing by 54 Gt C by 2100 in a climate change simulation compared with an 80 Gt C decrease in HadCM3LC. The multipool carbon dynamics of RothC cause it to exhibit a slower magnitude of transient response to both increased organic carbon inputs and changes in climate. We conclude that the projection of a positive feedback between climate and carbon cycle is robust, but the magnitude of the feedback is dependent on the structure of the soil carbon model. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon cycle feedbacks; Climate change; Soil carbon dynamics","carbon cycle; climate change; organic carbon; soil carbon",,,,,,"Berthelot, M., Friedlingstein, P., Ciais, P., Global response of the terrestrial biosphere to CO2 and climate change using a coupled climate-carbon cycle model (2002) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 16, pp. 31:1-31:15. , doi:10.1029/2001GB001827; Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Collins, M., The role of ecosystem-atmosphere interactions in simulated Amazonian precipitation decrease and forest dieback under global climate warming (2004) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 78, pp. 157-175; Bubier, J.L., Bhatia, G., Moore, T.R., Spatial and temporal variability in growing season net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange at a large peatland in Ontario, Canada (2003) Ecosystems, 6, pp. 353-367; Clein, J.S., McGuire, A.D., Zhang, X., Historical and projected carbon balance of mature black spruce ecosystems across North America: The role of carbon-nitrogen interactions (2002) Plant and Soil, 242, pp. 15-32; Coleman, K., Jenkinson, D.S., (1999) RothC-26.3, A Model for the Turnover of Carbon in Soil: Model Description and User's Guide, , Lawes Agricultural Trust, Harpenden, UK; Cowling, S.A., Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Contrasting simulated past and future responses of the Amazonian forest to atmospheric change (2004) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 359, pp. 539-547; Cox, P.M., (2001) Description of the TRIFFID Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, , Technical Note 24.
