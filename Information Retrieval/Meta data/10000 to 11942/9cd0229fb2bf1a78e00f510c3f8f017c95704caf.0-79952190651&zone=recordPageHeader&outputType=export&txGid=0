In order to extend exergy to analyze environmental interactions, modifications are required to the traditional representation of the environment and definition of the dead state used in technical exergy analysis. These are accomplished through a combination of logical extensions and use of non-equilibrium thermodynamic principles. The framework is comprised of two separate components: (1) environmental exergy analysis and (2) anthropocentric sensitivity analysis. Environmental exergy analysis is based on fundamental thermodynamic principles and analysis techniques. It extends the principles of technical exergy analysis to the environment in order to quantify the locations, magnitudes, and types of environmental impact-state change, alteration of natural transfers, and destruction change. Anthropocentric sensitivity analysis is based on the concepts of anthropocentric value and anthropocentric sensitivity. It enables the results of environmental exergy analysis to be interpreted for decision making, but at the expense of introducing some subjectivity into the framework. A key attribute of the framework is its ability to evaluate and compare the environmental performance of energy systems on a level playing field, regardless of the specifics of the systems-resources, by-products, sizes, time scales. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Dead state free energy; Environmental change; Environmental impact; Exergy; Exergy analysis; Reference state","Analysis techniques; Dead state free energy; Energy systems; Environmental change; Environmental interactions; Environmental performance; Exergy analysis; Key attributes; Level playing fields; Non equilibrium thermodynamics; Photochemical smog; Reference state; Secondary impacts; Time-scales; Air pollution; Decision making; Environmental management; Exergy; Global warming; Sensitivity analysis; Environmental impact; environmental change; environmental impact; exergy; performance assessment; thermodynamics",,,,,,"(2003) IPCC third assessment report: climate change 2001, , Tech.
