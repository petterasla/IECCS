Climate change has, and will continue to have, profound effects on the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. As such, there is a critical need to continue to develop a sound scientific basis for national and international policies regulating carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reflects on the nature of current global change experiments, and provides recommendations for a unified multidisciplinary approach to future research in this dynamic field. These recommendations include: (1) better integration between experiments and models, and amongst experimental, monitoring, and space-for-time studies; (2) stable and increased support for long-term studies and multi-factor experiments; (3) explicit inclusion of biodiversity, disturbance, and extreme events in experiments and models; (4) consideration of timing vs intensity of global change factors in experiments and models; (5) evaluation of potential thresholds or ecosystem 'tipping points'; and (6) increased support for model-model and model-experiment comparisons. These recommendations, which reflect discussions within the TERACC international network of global change scientists, will facilitate the unraveling of the complex direct and indirect effects of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and their components.","Global change experiments; Global climate change; TERACC; Terrestrial ecosystems","Air pollution; Biodiversity; Chlorine compounds; Climate control; Climatology; Ecology; Ecosystems; Experiments; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Public policy; Research; Carbon sequestrations; Extreme events; Future research; Global change experiments; Global change factors; Global changes; Global climate change; Global climate changes; Green house gas emissions; Indirect effects; Integrated approach; International policies; Multi factors; Multi-disciplinary approach; TERACC; Terrestrial ecosystems; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem response; ecosystem structure; experimental study; global climate; integrated approach; terrestrial ecosystem; article; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; global change; global climate; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; land biome; priority journal; Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forestry; Geography; Humans; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; World Health",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Long, S.P., What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)?
