The dissolution behavior of CO2 in pure/sea water was studied under the conditions of the intermediate depth ocean, i.e., high pressure and low temperature conditions. In these conditions, CO2 clathrate hydrate film was formed at the interface between CO2 and water. The solubility increased with increasing pressure and salinity.","Carbondioxide; Dissolution; LIF; PH visualization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00219592,,JCEJA,,"English","J. Chem. Eng.
