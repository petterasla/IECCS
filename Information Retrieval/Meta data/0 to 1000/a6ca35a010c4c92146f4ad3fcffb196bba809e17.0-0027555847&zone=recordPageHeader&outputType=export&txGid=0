The atmospheric accumulation of these gases is expected to add to the global warming predicted for expected increases of CO2, CH4, N2O, tropospheric ozone and H2O. Over the next decades, production of CFCs is scheduled to be phased out, while emissions of their alternatives are expected to increase. A simple model is used to illustrate the methodology for determining the time variations of the radiative forcing and temperature changes attributable to the direct greenhouse effect from potential emissions of the halocarbons. Although there are uncertainties associated with the lifetimes of the greenhouse gases, CFCs and their substitutes, the future growth rates of these gases, and the parameters used to simulate the response of the Earth-climate system, the method serves to illustrate an important aspect of the greenhouse warming issue beyond what is provided by the various greenhouse warming indices. Our results show that for likely substitution scenarios, the warming due to halocarbons will correspond to 4-10% of the total expected greenhouse warming at the year 2100. However, uncontrolled growth of the substitutes could result in an eight-fold increase in halocarbon production and a doubling of the halocarbon contribution by 2100. © 1993.","CFC substitues; global warming potential; Greenhouse warming; halocarbons","Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Fluorocarbons; Mathematical models; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouse warming; Halocarbons; Time variations; Greenhouse effect; chlorofluorocarbon; article; chemistry; climate; greenhouse effect; CFC substitute; CFCs; greenhouse warming; halocarbon; warming potential",,,,,,"Cess, Interpretation of cloud climate feedback as produced by atmospheric general circulation models (1989) Science, 245, pp. 513-516; CMA (Chemical Manufacturers Association), (1990) Production, sales and release of CFC-11 and CFC-12 through 1988, , CMA, Washington, DC; Derwent, Volz-Thomas, The tropospheric lifetimes of halocarbons and their reactions with OH radicals: an assessment based on the concentration of 14CO (1990) Scientific Assessment of Stratospheric Ozone: 1989 World Meteorological Organization, Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project, , Report No. 20, WMO, Geneva; Dickinson, Modeling climatic changes due to carbon dioxide increases (1982) Carbon Dioxide Review, pp. 101-133. , W.C.
