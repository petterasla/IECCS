Many species have responded to contemporary climate change through shifts in their geographic range. This could lead to increased sympatry between recently diverged species; likely increasing the potential for hybridization. Recently, following a series of warm winters, southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) in Ontario, Canada rapidly expanded their northern range limit resulting in increased sympatry with the closely related northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). This provided the opportunity to test the prediction that contemporary climate change can act as a catalyst creating conditions for the formation of hybrid zones. Following extensive sampling and molecular analyses (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA), we identified the occurrence of hybridization between sympatric G. sabrinus and G. volans.There was evidence of backcrossing but not of extensive introgession, consistent with the hypothesis of recent rather than historic hybridization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of hybrid zone formation following a range expansion induced by contemporary climate change. This is also the first report of hybridization between North American flying squirrel species. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate warming; Distribution; Glaucomys sabrinus; Glaucomys volans; Global change; Range expansion","climate change; climate effect; evolution; geographical distribution; global change; hybridization; identification method; molecular analysis; new record; range expansion; rodent; winter; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Glaucomys; Glaucomys sabrinus; Glaucomys volans; Pteromyini; Sciuridae",,,,,,"Allendorf, F., Leary, R., Spruell, P., Wenburg, J., The problems with hybrids: setting conservation guidelines (2001) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 16, pp. 613-622; Arbogast, B.S., Mitochondrial DNA phylogeography of the new world flying squirrels (Glaucomys): implications for pleistocene biogeography (1999) Journal of Mammalogy, 80, pp. 142-155; Arbogast, B.S., A brief history of the new world flying squirrels: phylogeny, biogeography, and conservation genetics (2007) Journal of Mammalogy, 88, pp. 840-849; Arbogast, B.S., Browne, R.A., Weigl, P.D., Kenagy, G.J., Conservation genetics of endangered flying squirrels (Glaucomys) from the Appalachian mountains of eastern North America (2005) Animal Conservation, 8, pp. 123-133; Bidlack, A.L., Cook, J.A., Reduced genetic variation in insular northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) along the North Pacific Coast (2001) Animal Conservation, 4, pp. 283-290; Bowman, J., Cappuccino, N., Fahrig, L., Patch size and population density: the effect of immigration behavior (2002) Conservation Ecology, 6, p. 9. , http://www.consecol.org/vol6/iss1/art9, Available at (accessed 3 April 2009); Bowman, J., Holloway, G.L., Malcolm, J.R., Middel, K.R., Wilson, P.J., Northern range boundary dynamics of southern flying squirrels: evidence of an energetic bottleneck (2005) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 83, pp. 1486-1494; Britch, S.C., Cain, M.L., Howard, D.J., Spatio-temporal dynamics of the Allonemobius fasciatus-A. socius mosaic hybrid zone: a 14-year perspective (2001) Molecular Ecology, 10, pp. 627-638; Buggs, R.J.A., Empirical study of hybrid zone movement (2007) Heredity, 99, pp. 301-312; Buttel, L.A., Durrett, R., Levin, S.A., Competition and species packing in patchy environments (2002) Theoretical Population Biology, 61, pp. 265-276; Coyne, J.A., Orr, H.A., (2004) Speciation, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland; Currat, M., Ruedi, M., Petit, R.J., Excoffier, L., The hidden side of invasions: massive introgression by local genes (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 1908-1920; Dray, S., Dufour, A.B., The ade4 package: implementing the duality diagram for ecologists (2007) Journal of Statistical Software, 22, pp. 1-20; Falush, D., Stephens, M., Pritchard, J.K., Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data: linked loci and correlated allele frequencies (2003) Genetics, 164, pp. 1567-1587; Fokidis, H.B., Schable, N.A., Hagen, C., Glenn, T.C., Risch, T.S., Characterization of microsatellite DNA loci for the southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) (2003) Molecular Ecology Notes, 3, pp. 616-618; Freeland, J.R., Boag, P.T., The mitochondrial and nuclear genetic homogeneity of the phenotypically diverse Darwin's ground finches (1999) Evolution, 53, pp. 1553-1563; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report, , IPCC.
