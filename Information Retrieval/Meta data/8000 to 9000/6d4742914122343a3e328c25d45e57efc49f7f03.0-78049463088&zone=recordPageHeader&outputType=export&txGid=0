With the high tidal range of up to 9.7 m on the west coast of Korea, numerous tidal current projects are being planned and constructed. To extract a significant quantity of power, a tidal current farm with a multi-arrangement is necessary in the ocean. The rotor, which initially converts the energy, is a very important component because it affects the efficiency of the entire system, and its performance is determined by various design variables. The power generation is strongly dependent on the size of the rotor and the incoming flow velocity. However, the interactions between devices also contribute significantly to the total power capacity. Therefore, rotor performance considering the interaction problems needs to be investigated for generating maximum power in a specific field. This paper documents a performance study of devices considering the interference between rotating rotors with axial, transverse and diagonal arrangements. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CFD (computational fluid dynamics); CWC (circulation water channel); interference effect; renewable energy; rotor; TCP (tidal current power)","CFD (computational fluid dynamics); CWC (circulation water channel); interference effect; Renewable energies; Tidal currents; Computational fluid dynamics; Fluid dynamics; Global warming; Ocean currents; Renewable energy resources; Rotors; Tides; Water distribution systems; Tidal power",,,,,,"Garbuglia, E., Rosa, A.D., Berti, D., Exploitation of marine current energy (1993) Offshore Technology Conference, pp. 509-519. , Dallas; Young, R.M., Requirements for a tidal power demonstration scheme (1995) J Power Energy, 209, pp. 215-220; Bernshtein Lev, B., Tidal power development -A realistic, justifiable and topical problem of today (1995) IEEE Trans Energy Conv, 10, pp. 591-599. , 10.1109/60.464887; Shiono, M., Suzuki, K., Kiho, S., Experiments on the characteristics of Darrious Turbine for the tidal power generation (1999) Proceeding of the Ninth International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference, Brest, 1, pp. 123-128; Walsum, W., Offshore engineering for tidal power (1999) Proceeding of the Ninth International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference, Brest, 1, pp. 777-784; Jo, C.H., Kim, K.S., Min, K.H., Study on HAT current generation rotor (2002) J Ocean Eng Technol, the Korean Society of Ocean Engineers, 16, pp. 78-82; Jo, C.H., Par, K.K., Im, S.W., Interaction of multi arrayed current power generations (2007) International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference, pp. 302-306. , Lisbon","Jo, C.-H.; Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Inha University, 253, Yonghyun-Dong, Nam-Gu, Incheon 402-751, South Korea; email: chjo@inha.ac.kr",,,,,,,,16747321,,,,"English","Sci.
