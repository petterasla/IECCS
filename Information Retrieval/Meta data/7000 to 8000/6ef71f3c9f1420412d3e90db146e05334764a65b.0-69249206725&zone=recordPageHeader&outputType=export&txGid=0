O. Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand","With the prospect of large-scale environmental changes, there is an urgent need to obtain information regarding environmental influences acting on the emergence of cercariae in marine systems. We investigated the response of trematodes of the intertidal snail Zeacumantus subcarinatus to altered temperature, salinity, and water level. The emergence of one trematode species, Maritrema novaezealandensis (Microphallidae), showed a weak trend to decrease with increased temperature; whereas, the emergence of a second species, Philophthalmus sp. (Philophthalmidae), increased at warmer temperatures. Both species exhibited increased cercarial emergence at the lowest salinity used (30 PSU). More M. novaezealandensis cercariae emerged when snails were kept partially submerged. In contrast, emergence of Philophthalmus sp. increased when snails were completely submerged. These results may reflect different transmission strategies employed by the two trematode species. Based on this model, we propose that trematode parasitism in intertidal zones is likely to be impacted by various changes in the marine environment resulting from global warming. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,"sea water; article; cercaria; eye fluke; intertidal species; marine environment; marine snail; Maritrema novaezealandensis; nonhuman; priority journal; salinity; sea level; trematode; water temperature; Animals; Gastropoda; Salinity; Seawater; Temperature; Trematoda; Gastropoda; Maritrema novaezealandensis; Microphallidae; Philophthalmidae; Philophthalmus; Trematoda; Zeacumantus subcarinatus",,,,,,"Berger, V.J., Kharazova, A.D., Mechanisms of salinity adaptations in marine mollusks (1997) Hydrobiologia, 355, pp. 115-126; Cheng, R.T., Casulli, V., Gartner, J.W., Tidal, residual, intertidal mudflat model and its applications in San Francisco Bay, California (1993) Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 36, pp. 235-280; Combes, C., Fournier, A., Mone, H., Theron, A., Behaviours in trematode cercariae that enhance parasite transmission: Patterns and processes (1994) Parasitology, 109, pp. 3-S13; Fingerut, J.T., Zimmer, C.A., Zimmer, R.K., Patterns and processes of larval emergence in an estuarine parasite system (2003) Biol Bull, 205, pp. 110-120; Fredensborg, B.L., Mouritsen, K.N., Poulin, R., Impact of trematodes on host survival and population density in the intertidal gastropod Zeacumantus subcarinatus (2005) Mar Ecol Prog ser, 290, pp. 109-117; Knauss, J.A., (1978) Introduction to Physical Oceanography, , Prentice Hall New Jersey; Koprivnikar, J., Poulin, R., Interspecific and intraspecific variation in cercariae release (2009) J Parasitol, 95, pp. 14-19; Lo, C.-T., Lee, K.-M., Pattern of emergence and the effects of temperature and light on the emergence and survival of heterophyid cercariae (Centrocestus formosanus and Haplorchis pumilio) (1996) J Parasitol, 82, pp. 347-350; Lyholt, H.C.K., Buchmann, K., Diplostomum spathaceum: Effects of temperature and light on cercarial shedding and infection of rainbow trout (1996) Dis Aquat Org, 25, pp. 169-173; Marcogliese, D.J., Implications of climate change for parasitism of animals in the aquatic environment (2001) Can J Zool, 79, pp. 1331-1352; Martorelli, S.R., Fredensborg, B.L., Mouritsen, K.N., Poulin, R., Description and proposed life cycle of Maritrema novaezealandensis n. sp.
