The concern is that populations will be negatively affected by increasing temperatures without the capacity to adapt. Temperature-related adaptability in traits related to phenology and early life history are expected to be particularly important in salmonid fishes. We focused on the latter and investigated whether four populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) are locally adapted in early life-history traits. These populations spawn in rivers that experience different temperature conditions during the time of incubation of eggs and embryos. They were reared in a common-garden experiment at three different temperatures. Quantitative genetic differentiation (QST) exceeded neutral molecular differentiation (FST) for two traits, indicating local adaptation. A temperature effect was observed for three traits. However, this effect varied among populations due to locally adapted reaction norms, corresponding to the temperature regimes experienced by the populations in their native environments. Additive genetic variance and heritable variation in phenotypic plasticity suggest that although increasing temperatures are likely to affect some populations negatively, they may have the potential to adapt to changing temperature regimes. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Common-garden experiment; Global warming; Natural selection; Phenotypic plasticity; QST versus FST; Reaction norm","adaptation; anthropogenic effect; climate change; experimental study; genetic differentiation; genetic variation; heritability; life history trait; natural selection; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; reaction norm; salmonid; temperature effect; adaptive behavior; animal experiment; article; climate change; environmental change; female; geographic distribution; male; molecular genetics; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; priority journal; temperature acclimatization; trout; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Temperature; Trout; Pisces; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",,,,,,"Beacham, T.D., Murray, C.B., Adaptive variation in body size, age, morphology, egg size, and developmental biology of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in British Columbia (1987) Can.
