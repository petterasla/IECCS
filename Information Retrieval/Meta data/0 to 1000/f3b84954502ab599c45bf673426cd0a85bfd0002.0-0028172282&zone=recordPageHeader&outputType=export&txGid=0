Forestation and other forest management options to sequester CO2 in the tropical latitudes may fail unless they address local economic, social, environmental, and political needs of people in the developing world. Forest management is discussed in terms of three objectives: carbon sequestration, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation. An integrated forest management strategy of land-use planning is proposed to achieve these objectives and is centered around: preservation of primary forest, intensified use of nontimber resources, agroforestry, and selective use of plantation forestry. © 1994 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Biodiversity; Carbon; Greenhouse gas; Integrated forest management; Socioeconomic; Sustainable development; Tropical forestry","Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Land use; Project management; Strategic planning; Biodiversity; Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gas; Integrated forest management; Sustainable development; Tropical forestry; Forestry; carbon; carbon dioxide; conference paper; economic development; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; forest; greenhouse effect; land use; socioeconomics; tropics; biodiversity conservation; carbon sequestration; environmental planning; forest management; land-use planning; sustainable development",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Andrasko, K., Global warming and forests: An overview of current knowledge (1990) Unasylva, 41, pp. 3-11; Barbier, E.B., Burgess, J.C., Markandya, A., The economics of tropical deforestation (1991) Ambio, 20, pp. 55-58; Barrett, S., (1988) Economic guidelines for the conservation of biological diversity, , Paper presented at the Workshop on Economics, IUCN General Assembly, Costa Rica; Batisse, M., The biosphere reserve: A tool for environmental conservation and management (1982) Environmental Conservation, 9, pp. 101-111; Batisse, M., Development and implementation of the biosphere reserve concept and its applicability to coastal regions (1990) Environmental Conservation, 17, pp. 111-116; Browder, J.O., The limits of extractivism (1992) BioScience, 42 (3), pp. 174-182; Brown, L., (1988) State of the world 1988, , L.
