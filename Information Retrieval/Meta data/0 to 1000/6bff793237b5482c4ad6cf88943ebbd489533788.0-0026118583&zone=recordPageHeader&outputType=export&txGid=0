Desirable features include ethanol's fuel properties as well as benefits with respect to urban air quality, global climate change, balance of trade, and energy security. Energy balance, feedstock supply, and environmental impact considerations are not seen as significant barriers to the widespread use of fuel ethanol derived from cellulosic biomass. Conversion economics is the key obstacle to be overcome. In light of past progress and future prospects for research-driven improvements, a cost-competitive process appears possible in a decade.",,"Automotive Fuels; Biomass; Cellulose - Applications; Fuels; Biofuels Feedstock; Cellulosic Biomass; Energy Balance; Fuel Ethanol; Net Carbon Produced Per Unit Energy; Processing Options; Ethanol",,,,,,,"Lynd, L.R.; Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH 03755, United States",,,,,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","Science",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026118583
