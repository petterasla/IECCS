According to some recent studies, the Italian territory has been suffering a precipitation decrease, especially in the last 50 years, and the southern areas seem to be more affected. The aim of the present study is to analyse rainfall time series over a wide time interval and a wide area, detecting potential trends and assessing their significance. For this purpose, 211 gauged stations, mainly located within the Campania region, southern Italy, have been analysed for the period 1918-1999. An accurate database has been set up through a data quality and time series homogeneity process. Statistical analysis of the database highlight that (1) the trend appears predominantly negative, both at the annual and seasonal scale, except for the summer period when it appears to be positive; (2) over the whole reference period, positive and negative trends are significant respectively for 9 and 27% of total stations and (3) over the last 30 years, a negative trend is instead significant for 97% of the total stations. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.","Mediterranean area;
