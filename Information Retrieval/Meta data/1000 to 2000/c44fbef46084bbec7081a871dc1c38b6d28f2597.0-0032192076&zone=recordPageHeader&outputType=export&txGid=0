The effects of temperature on the bacteria-induced bleaching experiments in aquaria were consistent with the natural bleaching of O. patagonica in the Mediterranean Sea. In situ bleaching increased rapidly from late May to September, following the rise of surface seawater temperature, which reaches 29°C in August. During the winter, when the seawater temperature drops to 16°C, most of the bleached coral colonies recovered. Vibrio AK-1 was isolated from all bleached corals examined in the summer, but could not be isolated from healthy (unbleached) corals in the summer or from bleached and unbleached corals in the winter. The mechanism by which increased temperature causes the coral bleaching by Vibrio AK-1 is at present not clear. The bacteria grow in the laboratory relatively rapidly at 16°C (doubling time 2 h), indicating that bacterial growth is probably not the critical factor. We suggest that temperature-regulated factors affecting bacterial virulence may play a role in the bleaching process.","Bacterial infection; Bleaching; Coral; Mediterranean; Oculina; Temperature; Vibrio","bacterium; coral bleaching; temperature effect; virulence; Mediterranean Sea; Anthozoa; Oculina patagonica; Vibrio",,,,,,"Atwood, D.K., Hendee, J.C., Mendes, A., An assessment of global warming stress on Caribbean coral reef ecosystems (1992) Bull Mar Sci, 51, pp. 118-130; Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching: Causes and consequences (1997) Proc 8th Int Coral Reef Symp, 1, pp. 65-74; Brown, B.E., Dunne, R.P., Chansang, H., Coral bleaching relative to elevated seawater temperature in the Andaman Sea (Indian Ocean) over the last 50 years (1996) Coral Reefs, 15, pp. 151-152; Brown, B.E., Le Tissier, M.D.A., Bythell, J.C., Mechanisms of bleaching deduced from histological studies of reef corals sampled during a natural bleaching event (1995) Mar Biol, 122, pp. 655-663; Bruckner, A.W., Bruckner, R.J., The persistence of blackband disease in Jamaica: Impact on community structure (1997) Proc 8th Int Coral Reef Symp, 1, pp. 601-606; Buddemeier, R.W., Fautin, D.G., Coral bleaching as an adaptive mechanism: A testable hypothesis (1993) BioSci, 43, pp. 320-325; Colwell, R.R., Global climate and infectious disease: The cholera paradigm (1996) Science, 274, pp. 2025-2031; D'Elia, C.F., Buddemeier, R.W., Smith, S.V., (1991) Workshop on Coral Bleaching, Coral Reef Ecosystems and Global Change: Report of Proceedings, , June 1991.
