Reduced albedo radiation reflected back into space, due to lesser low cloud cover, results in an increase in the surface temperature on the earth. Extrapolation of the intensity of galactic cosmic radiation using 10Be measurements in deep polar ice as the proxy, clearly shows that the primary cosmic ray intensity has decreased by 9% during the last 150 years, due to the continuing increase in solar activity. We present evidence to show that the radiative forcing component due to the decrease in primary cosmic ray intensity during the last 150 years is 1.1 Wm-2, which is about 60% of that due to CO2 increase. We conclude that the future prediction of global warming presented by IPCC4 requires a relook to take into the effect due to long-term changes in the galactic cosmic ray intensity.","Climate change; Cloud cover; Cosmic rays; Global warming",,,,,,,"(2007) The Physical Science Basis, , Climatic Change 2007 Contribution of Working Group 1 to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, February; Svensmark, H., Friis-Christensen, E., Variation of cosmic ray flux and global cloud coverage - a missing link in solar climate relationship (1997) J.
