The Qinghai-Tibet Railway is a long-term plan. In order to maintain its normal operation, climatic changes over the next 50 to 100 years need to be considered. The passive method of simply increasing the thermal resistance by raising embankment height and using insulating materials has proven ineffective on ""warm"" permafrost and therefore cannot be used in the construction of Qinghai-Tibet Railway in ""warm"" and ice-rich permafrost area. To deal with the ""warm"" nature of the plateau permafrost and global warming, a series of proactive roadbed-cooling methods were employed, which include solar radiation control using shading boards, heat convection control using air ducts, thermosyphons, and air-cooled embankments, and finally heat conduction control using ""thermal semi-conductor"" materials. A proper combination of these measures can enhance the cooling effect. All these methods can be used to lower the ground temperature and to help stabilize the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Especially, the air-cooled embankments have the advantages of high efficiency, ease of installation, environmental friendliness, and relative low cost. © 2007.","""Warm""; Climatic warming; Cooled roadbed; Permafrost; Qinghai-Tibet Railway","Building materials; Canals; Cooling; Cooling systems; Embankments; Global warming; Heat conduction; Hydraulic structures; Ice; Railroad plant and structures; Railroads; Rails; Sun; Technology; Thermal insulating materials; Air ducts; Climatic warming; Conduction control; Convection control; Cooled roadbed; Cooling effects; Cooling methods; Embankment height; Environmental friendliness; Ground temperature; High-efficiency; Ice-rich permafrost; Low costs; Normal operation; Qinghai-Tibet Railway; Qinghai-Tibet railways; Solar radiation control; Thermal resistance; Warm; Permafrost; climate change; cooling; efficiency measurement; ground conditions; permafrost; railway construction; road construction; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,,,,,"Cheng, G.D., Construction of Qinghai-Tibet Railway with cooled roadbed (2003) China Railway Science, 24 (3), pp. 1-4. , (in Chinese with English abstract); Cheng, G.D., Influences of local factors on permafrost occurrence and their implications for Qinghai-Tibet Railway design (2004) Science in China, Series D: Earth Sciences, 47 (8), pp. 704-709; Cheng, G.D., A roadbed cooling approach for the construction of Qinghai-Tibet Railway (2005) Cold Regions Science and Technology, 42, pp. 169-176; Cheng, G.D., Permafrost studies in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for road construction (2005) Journal of Cold Regions Engineering, 19 (1), pp. 19-29; Cheng, G.D., Tong, B.L., Experimental research on an embankment in an area with massive ground ice at the lower limit of alpine permafrost (1978) National Research Council of Canada, 2, pp. 199-222. , Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Permafrost, Ottawa; Cheng, G.D., Tong, B.L., Luo, X.B., Two important problems of embankment construction in the section of massive ground ice (1981) Journal of Glaciology and Cryopedology, 3 (2), pp. 6-11. , (in Chinese); Delaloye, R., Reynard, E., Lambiel, C., Marescot, L., Monnet, R., Thermal anomaly in a cold scree slope (2003) Proceeding of the 8th International Permafrost Conference, pp. 175-180. , Phillips M., Springman S.M., and Arenson L.
