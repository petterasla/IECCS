It is found that, in the region north of 33°N (including Northeast, North China and the lower reaches of the Huaihe River), the phenophase advanced 1.1-4.3 days per decade for early spring and 1.4-5.4 days per decade for late spring, but in the eastern part of the southwest China it was dealyed by 2.9-6.9 days per decade in early spring and 2.4-6.2 days per decade in late spring. One outstanding feature is identified in Guangzhou in south China, where significant advance of 7.5 days per decade in early spring and delay of 4.6 days per decade in late spring were detected. Statistically siginficant correlation was found between the changes of spring phenophase and the temperatures of one or several months before the phenophase onset. The relationship between the trend of phenophase change and temperature change was highly non-linear (more sensitivity to cooling than to warming) and reached an asymptote 0.5°C per decade, which may have implication in the responses of the ecosystem in a future global warming scenario. In addition, we also examined the link between the spring phenophase, and length and mean temperature of the growing season, and the analyses suggested that they were highly correlated as well. © Springer 2006.",,"Ecology; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Rivers; Statistical methods; Phenophases changes; Spring phenophases; Temperature change; Climate change; analytical method; climate change; global warming; growing season; physiological response; spring (season); temperature profile; woody plant; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Huai River",,,,,,"Abu-Asab, M.S., Peterson, P.M., Shetler, S.G., Orli, S.S., Earlier plant flowering in spring as a response to global warming in the Washington, DC, area (2001) Biodiversity and Conservation, 10, pp. 597-612; Beaubien, E.G., Freeland, H.J., Spring phenology trends in Alberta, Canada: Links to ocean temperature (2000) Int.
