Consequently, no existing forest types are more shaped by historic hydrologic conditions, altered by manmade deviations from the natural water regime and vulnerable to consequences of global warming. The lowermost parts of the lowland forests, the wetlands, present the transitional zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems i.e. ponds, lakes, streams and rivers. Nowadays, due to excessive urbanization and the spread of agriculture, the total area of lowland forests and wetlands has been significantly reduced. One of the largest complexes of alluvial floodplain wetlands and lowland forests in Europe are situated in the South-East Europe, in the Sava and Drava River basins, tributaries to the Danube River. The Sava River is a unique example of a river where the floodplains are still intact, supporting both flood alleviation and biodiversity. Continental lowland forests in Croatia cover an area of more than 200.000 ha with a significant role in forestry production, flood reduction, recharging groundwater reserves, as well as filtering pollutants. The natural forest vegetation consists of mainly hardwood tree species such as the common oak (Quercus robur L.), field ash (Fraxinus excelsior Vahl.), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) and softwood species such as black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Geartn.), poplars (Populus sp.) and willows (Salix sp.). For the biological diversity of lowland forests and attached wetlands is strongly important specific combination of hydrology and soils. The development of these forests in history was determined by regular seasonal alternations of groundwater tables (hydro period) and periodic flooding. This paper presents the possibilities for the re-establishment of the water regime of lowland forests as one option to reduce the impact of climate change in the future. To reduce negative impacts of anthropogenic alternations in the groundwater regime from the past and to attenuate slow down future very possible prolongation of droughts and water scarcity in the lowlands, various forest managerial and engineering practices could be considered. Basically, there are potentially two main contrasted measures of soil water balance manipulation: drainage of soils (through drainage ditches and channels) which contribute to decreasing the groundwater tables and forest management i.e. (tendering and thinning) which contribute to increased soil water content and increase in the groundwater level. Through these water table management practices, the amount of soil water required for the survival of lowland forests could be maintained to some degree to attenuate the negative hydrologic trends and natural hazards such as droughts. The comprehensive methodological review of activities that must precede such reconstruction activities are presented. As the initial segment all the major components of floodplain ecosystems - the morphology of the terrain, hydrography, soils stratigraphy, vegetation and anthropogenic influences - should be assessed. As a next step methodological options towards how to obtain the knowledge of the natural water regime prior anthropogenic hydrotechnical activities which caused the creation of the ecosystem in its current form are presented. For this purpose the morphology of hydromorphic soils i.e. relict indicators of natural water regime in lowland habitats are assessed. The next step includes the spatial determination of critical areas or hot spots, threatened by excessive falls in the groundwater level on which specific measures can be applied to return to natural water regime conditions (i.e. water retention in dry riverbeds).","Groundwater; Hydro-technical measures; Lowland forests; Relict indicators; Soil morphology; Water regime","Hydro-technical measures; Lowland forests; Relict indicators; Soil morphology; Water regime; Banks (bodies of water); Biodiversity; Drainage; Drought; Ecosystems; Flood control; Forestry; Global warming; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Lakes; Morphology; Soil moisture; Stratigraphy; Vegetation; Water content; Wetlands; Rivers; aquatic ecosystem; dicotyledon; floodplain; forest ecosystem; forestry production; global warming; groundwater resource; human activity; lowland environment; reconstruction; river basin; sustainable development; water level; wetland; Anatomy; Biodiversity; Drainage; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Forests; Ground Water; Lakes; Moisture; Moisture Content; Plants; Rivers; Soil; Wetlands; Danube Basin; Drau Basin; Sava Basin; Alnus; Alnus glutinosa; Carpinus; Carpinus betulus; Fraxinus; Fraxinus excelsior; Populus; Populus sp.; Quercus robur; Salix; Salix sp.",,,,,,"Antoni, O., Hatic, D., Krian, J., Bukovec, D., Modelling groundwater regime acceptable for the forest survival after the building of the hydro-electric power plant (2001) Ecological Modelling, 138 (1-3), pp. 277-288. , DOI 10.1016/S0304-3800(00)00408-7, PII S0304380000004087; Bates, B.C., Kundzewicz, Z.W., Wu, S., Palutikof, J.P., (2008) Climate Change and Water; Technical Paper of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. 210. , IPCC Secretariat;, Geneva; Blavet, D., Mathe, E., Leprun, J.C., Relations between soil colour and waterlogging duration in a representative hillside of the West African granito-gneissic bedrock (2000) Catena, 39 (3), pp. 187-210. , DOI 10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00087-9, PII S0341816299000879; Chang, M., Forest hydrology, An introduction to Water and Forests (2006) CRC-taylor & Francis, p. 474; Cowardin, L.M., Carter, V., Golet, F.C., LaRoe, E.T., Classification of wetlands and deepwater habitats of the United States (1979) U.
