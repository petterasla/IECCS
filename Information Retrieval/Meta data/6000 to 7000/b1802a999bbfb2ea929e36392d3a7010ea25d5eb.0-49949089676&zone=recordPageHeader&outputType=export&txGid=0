Substance-flow analysis and energy/exergy calculations were performed by using the software tool URWARE/ORWARE. Emissions were calculated and classified based on the impact categories global warming potential, acidification, and eutrophication, according to ISO14042 (2000). The analysis also included nutrient recovery (i.e., the potential to use nutrients as a fertilizer). Depending on which aspects are prioritized, different systems can be I considered to be the most advantageous.","Environmental systems analysis; Eutrophication; Organic waste; Substance-flow analysis; Sustainability; URWARE; Wastewater","Air pollution; Canning; Chemical oxygen demand; Chemical reactions; Computer software; Environmental engineering; Environmental management; Food preservation; Global warming; Nonmetals; Nutrients; Osmosis; Phosphorus; Plant management; Reverse osmosis; Sewage; Waste treatment; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Black water; Conventional systems; Environmental effects; Environmental systems analysis; Eutrophication; Flow analysis; Food waste disposers; Global warming potential; Household wastes; Nutrient recovery; Organic waste; Organic wastes; Phosphorus recovery; Resource consumptions; Sludge treatment; Software tools; Substance-flow analysis; Sustainability; URWARE; Waste water treatment plant; Wastewater; Waste management; acidification; comparative study; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; global warming; osmosis; phosphorus; resource use; software; sustainability; waste management; wastewater; acidification; article; environment; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; organic waste; priority journal; sludge; Sweden; urinary diversion; waste disposal; waste water management; water supply; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cities; City Planning; Conservation of Energy Resources; Sweden; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Purification; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",,,,,,"Ahlman, S., Svensson, G., Modelling Substance Flows in Urban Sewer Systems Using MATLAB/Simulink (2002) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Urban Drainage, , Strecker, E.
