We define two energy-related eco-efficiencies: energy efficiency (ENE) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-related eco-efficiency (GEE) using energy consumption and the associated GHG emissions as the environmental impacts. Using statistical data, we analyze China's energy consumption and GHG emissions by industrial subsystem and sector, and estimate the ENE and GEE values for China in 2007 as 4. 871×107 US$/PJ and 4. 26×108 US$/TgCO2eq, respectively. Industry is the primary contributing subsystem of China's economy, contributing 45. 2% to the total economic production, using 79. 6% of the energy consumed, and generating 91. 4% of the total GHG emissions. We distinguish the individual contributions of the 39 industrial sectors to the national economy, overall energy consumption, and GHG emissions, and estimate their energyrelated eco-efficiencies. The results show that although ferrous metal production contributes only 3. 5% to the national industrial economy, it consumes the most industrial energy (20% of total), contributes 16% to the total industrial global warming potential (GWP), and ranks third in GHG emissions. The power and heat sector ranks first in GHG emissions and contributes one-third of the total industrial GWP, although it only consumes about 8% of total industrial energy and, like ferrous metal production, contributes 3. 5% to the national economy. The ENE of the ferrous metal and power and heat sectors are only 8 and 2. 1×107 US$/PJ, while the GEE for these two sectors are 9 and 4×104 US$/GgCO2eq, respectively; these are nearly the lowest ENE and GEE values among all 39 industry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of ecoefficiency improvement through a comparison with other countries. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","eco-efficiency greenhouse gas (GHG); energy saving; global warming potential (GWP); industrial sectors",,,,,,,"Insam, H., Wett, B., Control of GHG emission at the microbial community level (2008) Waste Management (New York), 28 (4), pp. 699-706; Rive, N., Torvanger, A., Fuglestvedt, J.S., Climate agreements based on responsibility for global warming: periodic updating, policy choices, and regional costs (2006) Global Environmental Change, 16 (2), pp. 182-194; Cha, K., Lim, S., Hur, T., Eco-efficiency approach for global warming in the context of Kyoto Mechanism (2008) Ecological Economics, 67 (2), pp. 274-280; (1998) Eco-Efficiency, , OECD, Paris: OECD; Mao, J.S., Lu, Z.W., Yang, Z.F., Eco-efficiency of lead in China's leadacid battery system (2006) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 10 (1-2), pp. 185-197; Aoe, T., Eco-efficiency and eco-design in electrical and electronic products (2007) Journal of Cleaner Production, 15 (15), pp. 1406-1414; van Berkel, R., Eco-efficiency in primary metals production: context, perspectives and methods (2007) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 51 (3), pp. 511-540; Ryan, C., Climate change and ecodesign, Part I: the focus shifts to systems (2008) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 12 (2), pp. 140-143; Ryan, C., Climate change and ecodesign, Part II: exploring distributed systems (2009) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 13 (3), pp. 350-353; Wood, R., Lenzen, M., Aggregate measures of complex economic structure and evolution: a review and case study (2009) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 13 (2), pp. 264-283; Ashton, W.S., The structure, function, and evolution of a regional industrial ecosystem (2009) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 13 (2), pp. 228-246; (2008) China Energy Statistical Yearbook, , DITSNBS, Beijing: China Statistics Press; Xue, G.L., Energy problem: the ""Bottleneck"" that must be broken through for modernization of China (2005) Journal of PLA Nanjing Institute of Politics, 21 (122), pp. 62-64; Zhao, J.X., Meng, X.H., Discussion on the energy structure and strategy in China (2005) Coal Economic Research, 6, pp. 11-13; (2006) IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, , http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges/jp/public/2006gl/vol2.html, IPCC, Japan: IGES; (2008) Emission of greenhouse gases report, , www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/index.html, EIA (Energy information administration) accessed December 2008; General schemes for energy-saving & emission reduction (2007) State Council Gazette, 19, pp. 10-16. , SCPRC; Xu, X.Y., Energy-saving & emission reduction: a new start point of industrial restructure (2007) Unity, 4, pp. 37-39; (2007) China Greenhouse Gas Research, , SCCSCP, Beijing: China Environmental Science Press; Lu, Z.W., Mao, J.S., Crossing ""Environmental Mountain""-on the increase and decrease of environment impact in the process of economic growth (2003) Engineering and Science, 5 (12), pp. 36-42; Zhang, J., Energy efficiency and economic growth of China: 1953-2006 (2009) Ecological Economics, 5 (2), pp. 122-131; Mao, J.S., Yang, Z.F., Lu, Z.W., Liu, R.M., An economic model for environmental management and planning and its application (2007) Acta Scientiarm Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis, 43 (4), pp. 509-516; Mao, J.S., Yang, Z.F., Lu, Z.W., Liu, R.M., The relationship between industrial development and environmental impacts in China (2007) Acta Scientiarm Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis, 43 (6), pp. 744-751; Fang, Y.P., The main technology and measure for improving energy efficiency (2009) Power Demand Side Management, 3, pp. 42-43; Zhang, Y.X., Liu, J., Cheng, J.H., Changing trends and adjusting policies of China's energy efficiency: an empirical analysis from the perspective of heavy industrial structure (2009) Chinese Journal of Management, 6, pp. 818-822; Wang, J.S., He, C.F., Technological development, structural change and Chinese energy consumption efficiency (2009) China Population Resources and Environment, 19 (2), pp. 157-161; Wei, C., Shen, M.H., Current progresses and new trend of research on energy efficiency: a literature review (2009) Journal of Zhejiang University, 3, pp. 55-63; (2003) The National Standard GB/T4754-2002, , CBNS, Beijing: CBNS; (2000) ISO14042: Environment management-life cycle assessmentlife cycle impact assessment, , ISO; (2008) China Statistical Yearbook, , NBSC, Beijing: China Statistics Press; Marland, G., Uncertainties in accounting for CO2 from fossil fuels (2008) Journal of Industrial Ecology, 12 (2), pp. 136-139; Marland, G., Hamal, K., Jonas, M., How uncertain are estimates of CO2 emissions?
