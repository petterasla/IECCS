The etching process has been investigated as a function of etching time, discharge power density, chamber pressure, and additive gas. Etch rates were in the range of 250-650 angstroms/min and 100-400 angstroms/min for PZT and RuO2, respectively. A large etch selectivity between PZT and RuO2 was optimized. Etched surfaces exhibited smooth morphologies. Furthermore, the ferroelectric properties of PZT were not altered significantly by the etching process. A surface residue containing Cl and F was found after etching, but this organic substance was totally removed by an after-etch bake. In addition, the etched profile of the PZT films was studied through SEM.",,"Electrodes; Environmental protection; Ferroelectricity; Lead compounds; Morphology; Pressure effects; Reactive ion etching; Ruthenium compounds; Scanning electron microscopy; Surfaces; Thin films; Titanium oxides; Additive gas; Chamber pressure; Discharge power density; Environmentally safe etching gases; Etch rates; Etch selectivity; Etching time; Lead zirconate titanate; Ruthenium dioxide; Ferroelectric materials",,,,,,,"Pan, Wei; Virginia Polytechnic Inst and State, Univ, Blacksburg, United States",,,"Materials Research Society, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",,,,,08842914,,JMREE,,"English","J Mater Res",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028546047
