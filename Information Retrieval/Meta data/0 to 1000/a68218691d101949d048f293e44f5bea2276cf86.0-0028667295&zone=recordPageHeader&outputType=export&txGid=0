The Hamburg global coupled atmosphere-ocean circulation model demonstrates substantial skill in simulating the present-day climate and its interannual variability over the monsoon region. The onset date of the SW-monsoon over India along about 20°N inferred from the control run is similar to the observed onset date. With the exception of temperature, the projected changes in impact-related climatic variables over a period of 100 years are within the range of inter-annual variability in the monsoon region. There is no clear evidence for a significant change in the seasonal-mean monsoon rainfall or the variability of the monsoon rainfall in scenario A experiment. -Authors",,"climate change; coupled ocean-atmosphere; general circulation model; greenhouse effect; monsoon; monsoons; warming; India; Circulation; Climate; General; Global Warming; Indian Monsoon; Modelling-Mathematical",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028667295
