Vector competence, in turn, can be influenced by temperature and viral genetics. West Nile virus (WNV) was introduced into the United States of America in 1999 and subsequently spread throughout much of the Americas. Previously, we have shown that a novel genotype of WNV, WN02, first detected in 2001, spread across the US and was more efficient than the introduced genotype, NY99, at infecting, disseminating, and being transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. In the current study, we determined the relationship between temperature and time since feeding on the probability of transmitting each genotype of WNV. We found that the advantage of the WN02 genotype increases with the product of time and temperature. Thus, warmer temperatures would have facilitated the invasion of the WN02 genotype. In addition, we found that transmission of WNV accelerated sharply with increasing temperature, T, (best fit by a function of T4) showing that traditional degree-day models underestimate the impact of temperature on WNV transmission. This laboratory study suggests that both viral evolution and temperature help shape the distribution and intensity of transmission of WNV, and provides a model for predicting the impact of temperature and global warming on WNV transmission. © 2008 Kilpatrick et al.",,"article; Culex pipiens; disease carrier; epidemic; genotype; greenhouse effect; high temperature; laboratory test; mosquito; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; time; United States; viral genetics; virus replication; virus strain; virus transmission; West Nile flavivirus; animal; Culex; disease carrier; disease transmission; genetics; temperature; virology; virus infection; Culex pipiens; West Nile virus; Animals; Culex; Insect Vectors; Temperature; Time; West Nile Fever; West Nile virus","GENBANK: AF404756",,,,,"Ewald, P.W., (1994) Evolution of infectious disease, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., Coevolution of Hosts and Parasites (1982) Parasitology, 85, pp. 411-426; Jetten, T.H., Focks, D.A., Potential changes in the distribution of dengue transmission under climate warming (1997) American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 57, pp. 285-297; Pascual, M., Rodo, X., Ellner, S.P., Colwell, R., Bouma, M.J., Cholera dynamics and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (2000) Science, 289, pp. 1766-1769; Hopp, M.J., Foley, J.A., Worldwide fluctuations in dengue fever cases related to climate variability (2003) Climate Research, 25, pp. 85-94; Rua, G.L., Quinones, M.L., Velez, I.D., Zuluaga, J.S., Rojas, W., Laboratory estimation of the effects of increasing temperatures on the duration of gonotrophic cycle of Anopheles albimanus (Diptera : Culicidae) (2005) Memorias Do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, 100, pp. 515-520; Oda, T., Uchida, K., Mori, A., Mine, M., Eshita, Y., Effects of high temperature on the emergence and survival of adult Culex pipiens molestus and Culex quinquefasciatus in Japan (1999) Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association, 15, pp. 153-156; Kramer, L.D., Li, J., Shi, P.Y., West Nile virus (2007) Lancet Neurology, 6, pp. 171-181; Kilpatrick, A.M., Ladeau, S.L., Marra, P.P., Ecology of West Nile virus transmission and its impact on birds in the western hemisphere (2007) Auk, 124, pp. 1121-1136; Savage, H.M., Aggarwal, D., Apperson, C.S., Katholi, C.R., Gordon, E., Host Choice and West Nile Virus Infection Rates in Blood Fed Mosquitoes, Including Members of the Culex pipiens complex, from Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee 2002-2003 (2007) Vector Borne Zoonotic Diseases, 7, pp. 365-386; Kilpatrick, A.M., Daszak, P., Jones, M.J., Marra, P.P., Kramer, L.D., Host heterogeneity dominates West Nile virus transmission (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 2327-2333; Kilpatrick, A.M., Kramer, L.D., Jones, M.J., Marra, P.P., Daszak, P., West Nile virus epidemics in North America are driven by shifts in mosquito feeding behavior (2006) PLoS Biol, 4, pp. e82. , doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040082; Molaei, G., Andreadis, T., Armstrong, P., Anderson, J., Vossbrinck, C., Host feeding patterns of Culex mosquitoes and West Nile virus transmission, northeastern United States (2006) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 12, pp. 468-474; Hamer, G.L., Kitron, U.D., Brawn, J.D., Loss, S.R., Ruiz, M.O., Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae): A Bridge Vector of West Nile Virus to Humans (2008) Journal of Medical Entomology, 45, pp. 125-128; Kilpatrick, A.M., Kramer, L.D., Campbell, S., Alleyne, E.O., Dobson, A.P., West Nile virus risk assessment and the bridge vector paradigm (2005) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 11, pp. 425-429; Health Canada (2007) West Nile virus. http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/wnv-vwn/ mon_e.html Accessed on January 16, 2007Petersen, L.R., Hayes, E.B., Westward ho?
