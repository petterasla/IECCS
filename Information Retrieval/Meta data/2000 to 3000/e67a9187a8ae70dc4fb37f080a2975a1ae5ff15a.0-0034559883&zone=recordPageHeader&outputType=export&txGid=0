Thermal energy accounts for more than two thirds of total energy utilization at present and therefore it is significant to extend the utilization of nuclear heat for the effective reduction of CO2 emissions in the world. This paper describes a coal gasification system using HTGR nuclear heat in an ammonia production plant in terms of industrial utilization of the nuclear heat. The system uses the nuclear heat directly in addition to generating electricity. A steam reforming method usnig a two-stage coal gasifier is employed: it improves the heat utilization efficiency of the secondary helium gas from the HTGR. Finally, the paper clarifies that the nuclear gasification system can reduce CO2 emissions by about five hundred thousand tons per year from that of a conventional system using fossil fuel.

Finally, the paper clarifies that the nuclear gasification system can reduce CO2 emissions by about five hundred thousand tons per year from that of a conventional system using fossil fuel.A coal gasification process for ammonia production based on HTGR nuclear heat is described. The reactor provides heat for the gasification process and generates electricity simultaneously. A steam reforming method and a two-stage coal gasifier are employed, improving the heat utilization efficiency of the secondary helium gas from the HTGR. The nuclear gasification technology can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 500,000 tpy relative to that of a conventional system based on fossil fuels.","Ammonia production plant; CO2 emission; Coal gasification; Heat utillization efficiency; HTGR; Industrial Utilization; Nuclear heat; Secondary helium gas; Steam reforming; Two-stage coal gasifier","Heat utilization efficiency; Steam reforming; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Coal gasification; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Helium; Industrial emissions; Reforming reactions; Steam; Thermal effects; Gas emissions; ammonia; coal; nuclear reactor",,,,,,"(1981) HTGR-Process Steam/Cogeneration and HTGR Steam Cycle Program, , GA-A 16239; Jager, W., Weisbrodt, I., Horning, H., Nuclear process heat applications for modular HTR (1984) Nuclear Engineering and Design, 78, pp. 137-145; (1994) Sekitan no Kouongasuka to Gasuka Hatsuden Gijutsu (Tecnology of High Temperature Gasification of Coal and Generating Electricity by Coal Gasification), , IPC; (in Japanese); Leuch, U., Steinwar, W., Modular high temperature reactor for various applications (1988) Kerntechnik, 52 (2), pp. 96-100","Inaba, Y.; Japan Atomic Energy Research Inst., Oarai-machi, Higashiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki-ken 311-1394, Japan; email: inaba@popsvr.tokai.jaeri.go.jp",,,,,,,,03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.
