It is estimated that carbon dioxide emissions are causing oceans to warm, ocean chemistry to change, and rainfall patterns to shift. It is also reported that the world's tropical coral reefs may be irreversibly destroyed in case global temperatures rise more than 1.5°C over the present level. It is also proved that the planetary water cycle has already altered due to global warming.",,"American Association fro the Advancement of Science (AAAS); Conductivity-temperature-depth equipment; Coral reefs; Upper ocean water; Carbon dioxide; Computer graphics; Glaciers; High temperature effects; Oceanography; Particulate emissions; Rain; Water; Global warming",,,,,,,"C and EN WashingtonUnited States",,,,,,,,00092347,,CENEA,,"English","Chem Eng News",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-15844425441
