It has been estimated that a 16% ozone depletion could result in a 5% loss in phytoplankton, which equals a loss of about 7 million tons of fish per year. Like humans, phytoplankton cannot perceive, and thereby avoid, UV-B radiation. Exposure to solar UV-B radiation has been shown to affect both orientation mechanisms and motility in phytoplankton, resulting in reduced survival rates for these organisms. Recent studies have also demonstrated that photosynthesis is inhibited in many red, brown, and green benthic algae. Solar UV-B radiation has been found to cause damage to early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other animals. The potential impact of chlorofluorocarbon substitutes and their degradation products is also discussed. -from Authors",,"aquatic ecosystems; biological production; climate change; review; ultraviolet radiation; algae; Amphibia; Animalia; Decapoda (Crustacea)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028993799
