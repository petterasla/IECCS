The climate change pattern was simulated through a set of hypothetical and monthly GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) scenarios of temperature increase coupled with precipitation changes. The daily outflow of the catchment, which is dominated by spring snowmelt runoff, was simulated by the coupling of snowmelt and soil moisture accounting models of the US National Weather Service River Forecast System. Two threshold levels were used to define a flood day - the double and triple long-term mean daily streamflow - and the flood parameters (occurrences, duration, magnitude, etc.) for these cases were determined. Despite the complicated response of flood events to temperature increase and threshold, both hypothetical and monthly GISS representations of climate change resulted in more and longer flood events for climates with increased precipitation. All climates yielded larger flood volumes and greater mean values of flood peaks with respect to precipitation increase. The lower threshold resulted in more and longer flood occurrences, as well as smaller flood volumes and peaks than those of the upper one. The combination of higher and frequent flood events could lead to greater risks of inundation and possible damage to structures. Furthermore, the winter swelling of the streamflow could increase erosion of the river bed and banks and hence modify the river profile.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Computer simulation; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Rivers; Runoff; Spring snowmelt; Floods; flood; flood frequency; global climate change; modellig; precipitation; streamflow; Greece, Acheloos River",,,,,,"Anderson, E.A., (1973) US National Weather Service River Forecast System.
