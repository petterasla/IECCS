Productivity F., Russian Academy of Sciences, Novocheremushkinskaya 69, 117418 Moscow, Russian Federation","A new approach is proposed for the evaluation of vegetation equilibrium response to global warming. The approach considers the dependence of the position of biome boundaries as significantly multi-valued function of climatic conditions; the reason for the multiplicity may be partly due to capacity of vegetation to change its environment. This result in hysteresis manifestations (threshold and irreversibility effects) in response to climate change. Matthews' global vegetation data set and IIASA climatic data base were used to reconstruct the domains of different biomes in a space of climatic factors (biotemperature and average precipitation). Based on the overlap of these domains, the maps of biomes' potential extent are calculated for present climate and for two scenarios of global warming (GISS and GFDL). These results imply a significant role for hysteresis phenomena in the global vegetation pattern. Maps of vegetation changes under two climate scenarios calculated with the help of a new algorithm to account for hysteresis indicate much less change than equivalent maps obtained by other equilibrium approaches under the two climate change scenarios. Changes are predicted for 20% of terrestrial area. A relatively small increase of forest and decrease of nonforest vegetation area predicted by both scenarios.",,"article; climate; computer analysis; forest; greenhouse effect; model; nonhuman; vegetation; Algorithms; Atmospheric temperature; Hysteresis; Maps; Plants (botany); Precipitation (chemical); Biome boundaries; Vegetation; Global warming; climate change; global warming; hysteresis; model comparison; modelling; prediction; vegetation response",,,,,,"Armand, A.D., (1992) Landscape Boundaries: Consequences for Biotic Diversity and Ecological Flows, pp. 360-378. , Springer, N.
