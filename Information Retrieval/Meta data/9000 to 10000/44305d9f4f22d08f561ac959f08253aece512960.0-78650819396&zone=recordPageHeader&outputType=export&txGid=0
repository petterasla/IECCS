In agriculture and cultivation one should count with frequent changes of weather conditions due to climate change. Although the tendency of 0.6 °C raise in the annual average of temperature in the past one hundred years does not risk our cultivation so far, the high fluctuation of temperature, the winters, and the shorter transition seasons cause real problems. Similar potential threads are the decreasing trend of precipitation volume, the longer drought periods, and more frequent sudden heavy rainfalls. To provide a safe and well scheduled production, it is essential to maintain a decision support monitoring system based on up-to-date and accurate weather data. It is extraordinary needed in site-specific precision farming systems, where the aim is to produce goods of the highest quality. Nowadays, remote sensing is one of the basic instruments of continuous monitoring. Processing the collected data provides information for many fields of cultivation from technological parts to decision support processes. The survey the vegetation state of plants, a measure can be calculated from remote sensing data, the so-called normalized vegetation index (NDVI).The aim of our research is to prove that satellite records can be a useful tool for maize seed production in two aspects: first, to find correlation between the NDVI and the weather conditions of a given year, and second, to find the optimal time interval for NDVI based crop estimation method.","Climate change; Crop of maize (Zea mays L.); NDVI; Remote sensing; Yield estimation","biomass; climate change; crop yield; estimation method; maize; NDVI; remote sensing; seed production; Hungary; Zea mays",,,,,,"Ángyán, J., Mass production forage maize production - Geographical location of maize production (in Hungarian) (1985) A kukoricatermesztés kézikönyve, pp. 199-228. , In, (ed.: Z.
