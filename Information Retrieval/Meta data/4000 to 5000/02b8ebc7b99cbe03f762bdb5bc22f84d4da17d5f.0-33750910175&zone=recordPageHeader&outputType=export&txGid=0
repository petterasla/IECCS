Carbon dioxide (CO2) is main greenhouse gas associated with global climate change. Collectively, they are projected to contribute, directly, about as much too potential global warming over the next 60 years as CO2. At the present time, coal is responsible for 30-40% of world CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. There were a higher correlation between amount of carbon dioxide emission and percentage of carbon in the fuel for all equations. The squares of correlation coefficients were 0.9999, 0.9978, and 0.9995.","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gas emissions","Carbon dioxide; Fuels; Greenhouse effect; Particulate emissions; Specific heat; Carbon dioxide emission; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Carbon",,,,,,"Bain, R.L., Overend, R.P., Craig, K.R., Biomass-fired power generation (1998) Fuel Process.
