This pelagic N-removal takes place within only ~0.1% of the ocean volume, hence moderate variations in the extent of OMZs due to global warming may have a large impact on the global N-cycle. We examined the effect of oxygen (O 2) on anammox, NH 3 oxidation and NO 3 - reduction in 15N-labeling experiments with varying O 2 concentrations (0-25 μmol L -1) in the Namibian and Peruvian OMZs. Our results show that O 2 is a major controlling factor for anammox activity in OMZ waters. Based on our O 2 assays we estimate the upper limit for anammox to be ~20 μmol L -1. In contrast, NH 3 oxidation to NO 2 - and NO 3 - reduction to NO 2 - as the main NH 4 + and NO 2 - sources for anammox were only moderately affected by changing O 2 concentrations. Intriguingly, aerobic NH 3 oxidation was active at non-detectable concentrations of O 2, while anaerobic NO 3 - reduction was fully active up to at least 25 μmol L -1 O 2. Hence, aerobic and anaerobic N-cycle pathways in OMZs can co-occur over a larger range of O 2 concentrations than previously assumed. The zone where N-loss can occur is primarily controlled by the O 2-sensitivity of anammox itself, and not by any effects of O 2 on the tightly coupled pathways of aerobic NH 3 oxidation and NO 3 - reduction. With anammox bacteria in the marine environment being active at O 2 levels ~20 times higher than those known to inhibit their cultured counterparts, the oceanic volume potentially acting as a N-sink increases tenfold. The predicted expansion of OMZs may enlarge this volume even further. Our study provides the first robust estimates of O 2 sensitivities for processes directly and indirectly connected with N-loss. These are essential to assess the effects of ocean de-oxygenation on oceanic N-cycling. © 2011 Kalvelage et al.",,"ammonia; ammonium derivative; anammox; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; unclassified drug; nitrogen; quaternary ammonium derivative; anaerobic metabolism; anammox bacteria; article; Chile; controlled study; denitrification; deoxygenation; marine environment; Namibia; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen cycling; ocean environment; oxidation; oxygen concentration; oxygen minimum zone; Peru; reduction; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrate, 14797-55-8; nitrite, 14797-65-0; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Oxygen, 7782-44-7; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds",,,,"Falkowski, P.G., Earth's Biogeochemical Cycles (2008) Science, 320, pp. 1034-1039; Wyrtki, K., Circulation and Water Masses in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean (1962) Deep-Sea Research, pp. 11-13; Karstensen, J., Stramma, L., Visbeck, M., Oxygen minimum zones in the eastern tropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans (2008) Progress in Oceanography, 77, pp. 331-350; Kamykowski, D., Zentara, S., Hypoxia in the world ocean as recorded in the historical data set (1990) Deep-Sea Research, 37 (12), pp. 1861-1874; Helly, J.J., Levin, L.A., Global distribution of naturally occurring marine hypoxia on continental margins (2004) Deep-Sea Research, 51, pp. 1159-1168; Revsbech, N.P., Larsen, L.H., Gundersen, J., Dalsgaard, T., Ulloa, O., Determination of ultra-low oxygen concentrations in oxygen minimum zones by the STOX sensor (2009) Limnology and Oceanography: Methods, 7, pp. 371-381; Codispoti, L.A., Brandes, J.A., Christensen, J.P., Devol, A.H., Naqvi, S.W., The oceanic fixed nitrogen and nitrous oxide budgets: Moving targets as we enter the anthropocene?
