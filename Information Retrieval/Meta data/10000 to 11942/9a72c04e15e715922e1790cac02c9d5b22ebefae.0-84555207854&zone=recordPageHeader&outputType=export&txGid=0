Several marine invertebrate species have invaded the U.S. southern and mid-Atlantic coast from the Caribbean and this poleward range expansion has been termed 'Caribbean Creep'. While models have predicted the continued decline of global biodiversity over the next 100 years due to global climate change, few studies have examined the episodic impacts of prolonged cold events that could impact species range expansions. Methodology/Principal Findings: A pronounced cold spell occurred in January 2010 in the U.S. southern and mid-Atlantic coast and resulted in the mortality of several terrestrial and marine species. To experimentally test whether cold-water temperatures may have caused the disappearance of one species of the 'Caribbean Creep' we exposed the non-native crab Petrolisthes armatus to different thermal treatments that mimicked abnormal and severe winter temperatures. Our findings indicate that Petrolisthes armatus cannot tolerate prolonged and extreme cold temperatures (4-6°C) and suggest that aperiodic cold winters may be a critical 'reset' mechanism that will limit the range expansion of other 'Caribbean Creep' species. Conclusions/Significance: We suggest that temperature 'aberrations' such as 'cold snaps' are an important and overlooked part of climate change. These climate fluctuations should be accounted for in future studies and models, particularly with reference to introduced subtropical and tropical species and predictions of both rates of invasion and rates of unidirectional geographic expansion. © 2011 Canning-Clode et al.",,"air temperature; article; climate change; cold exposure; controlled study; crab; invasive species; marine species; nonhuman; Petrolisthes armatus; population abundance; population density; population migration; sea surface temperature; species distribution; survival rate; United States; water temperature; animal; Central America; marine biology; Decapoda (Crustacea); Invertebrata; Petrolisthes armatus; Animals; Caribbean Region; Climate Change; Marine Biology",,,,,,"Stachowicz, J.J., Terwin, J.R., Whitlatch, R.B., Osman, R.W., Linking climate change and biological invasions: ocean warming facilitates nonindigenous species invasions (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99, pp. 15497-15500; Ward, N.L., Masters, G.L., Linking climate change and species invasion: an illustration using insect herbivores (2007) Global Change Biology, 13, pp. 1605-1615; Sorte, C.J.B., Williams, S.L., Zerebecki, R.A., Ocean warming increases threat of invasive species in a marine fouling community (2010) Ecology, 91, pp. 2198-2204; Butchart, S.H.M., Walpole, M., Collen, B., van Strien, A., Scharlemann, J.P.W., Global Biodiversity: Indicators of Recent Declines (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1164-1168; Dukes, J.S., Mooney, H.A., Does global change increase the success of biological invaders?
