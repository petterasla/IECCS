Comparing these impact projections to those obtained under a reference, business-as-usual, scenario assuming some moderate changes in the political, economic or technological spheres, indicates that global warming has potentially negative effects. The analysis is based on a global assessment of potential climate change-induced variations in world commodity production and trade. The Egyptian agricultural sector, and the non-agricultural sector to a lesser extent, are projected to be increasingly less self-sufficient. Specific potential adverse impacts are identified. The simulation results show that high-cost adaptation measures involving major changes in the agricultural system and practices may mitigate these adverse impacts. Stimulating economic development of the rural areas and creating appropriate conditions for effective diffusion and development of technologies - particularly for the agricultural sector - would seem a desirable strategy. Perhaps, more importantly, the simulation results show that the assumption of exogenously determined technological progress may be inappropriate, in which case the potential adverse impacts of a future warming of the global climate are likely to be fewer than is indicated in this study - if prevailing constraints on productivity growth in the major food and feed grains are 'released' by endogenous advances in technology. © 1995.",,"climate change; climatic change; crop yield; developing country; economic analysis; environmental economics; global warming; technological change; yield impact; Egypt",,,,,,"The winter season runs from November to May; the summer season from March/April to September; and the Nili season from May to November.

However, an unusually dry or cold year in a locality does not constitute a ‘climate change’, but rather ‘climate variability’.

This may be so. It is worthwhile also to note that the skew in regional/sectoral incomes seems ‘marked’ probably because the rural economy is not completely monetized. According to The World Bank, Egyptian consumer expenditure surveys over the years seem to suggest that the Egyptian income distribution is fairly egalitarian by the standards of developing countries and has not deteriorated noticeably over time. In the same report, the Bank states that ‘… when rural and urban average expenditures per household from the 1974–1975 survey are multiplied by the number of households in agriculture and non-agricultural activities respectively, the results are close to the total consumption expenditures estimated separately …’ The Gini coefficient for the [[Truncated]]United Nations Development Program, (1992) Human Development Report 1992, , Oxford University Press, It seems therefore that the relatively egalitarian approach to income distribution as well as the relationship between regional population and sectoral income are more or less preserved. Thus, average measures as applied in this study may still be useful approximations — if only because they are more easily accessible than specific sectoral/regional measures, particularly when we are making conjectures into a future as distant as seventy years hence; Rosenzweig, Parry, Fischer, Frohberg, Climate Change and World Food Supply (1993) Research Report No 3, , Environmental Change Unit, University of Oxford; International Bank for Reconstruction Development/The World Bank, (1990) World Development Report, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Goueli, Food security program in Egypt (1981) Food Security for Developing Countries, , Alberta Valdés, Westview Press, Boulder, CO; Richards, Food problems and state policies in Middle East and North Africa (1987) Pursuing Food Security: Strategies and Obstacles in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, , W Ladd Hollist, F LaMond Tullis, Westview Press, Boulder, CO; Food Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, (1991) Food Balance Sheets: 1984–1986 Average, , FAO, Rome; This possibility has been demonstrated by some Asian developing countries (eg Korea and Taiwan) whose rapid growth in the fairly recent past (1960–1980) was catalysed by their ability to assimilate technology and shift the production function along which they operated —facilitated by higher levels of human capital among other factors seePack, Technology gaps between industrial and developing countries: are there dividends for latecomers?
