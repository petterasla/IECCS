Climate change has been shown to cause phenological changes. These changes are not necessarily similar between species and may cause mismatches between prey and predator. Eurasian sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, the main predator of passerines, has advanced its autumn phenology by about ten days in 30 years due to climate change. However, we do not know if sparrowhawk migrate earlier in response to earlier migration by its prey or if earlier sparrowhawk migration results in changes to predation risk on its prey. By using the median departure date of 41 passerine species I was able to show that early migrating passerines tend to advance, and late migrating species delay their departure, but none of the species have advanced their departure times as much as the sparrowhawk. This has lead to a situation of increased predation risk on early migrating long-distance migrants (LDM) and decreased the overlap of migration season with later departing short-distance migrants (SDM). Findings highlight the growing list of problems of declining LDM populations caused by climate change. On the other hand it seems that the autumn migration may become safer for SDM whose populations are growing. Results demonstrate that passerines show very conservative response in autumn phenology to climate change, and thus phenological mismatches caused by global warming are not necessarily increasing towards the higher trophic levels. © 2011 Aleksi Lehikoinen.",,"article; autumn; climate change; controlled study; Finland; greenhouse effect; hawk; long distance migrant; nonhuman; phenology; population growth; population migration; predation risk; short distance migrant; sparrow; species comparison; trophic level; animal; hawk; physiology; predation; risk assessment; season; Accipiter nisus; Passeriformes; Animal Migration; Animals; Finland; Hawks; Predatory Behavior; Risk Assessment; Seasons",,,,,,"Elewa, A.M.T., (2007) Predation in Organisms.
