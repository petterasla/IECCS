In this work the standard LCA methodology has been extended to analyse the total environmental impacts of a new more efficient solar thermal system SOLARSTORE during its whole life cycle. This system is being developed by a 5th Framework EC project. The LCA results show that to produce 1 GJ energy with SOLARSTORE system will result in global warming potential of 6.3-10 kg CO2, acidification potential of 46.6-70 g SO2, eutrophication of 2.1-3.1 g phosphate and photochemical oxidant of 0.99-1.5 g C2H4. The raw material acquisition and components manufacturing processes contribute 99% to the total environmental impacts. In comparison with traditional heating systems, SOLARSTORE system provides a considerably better solution for reduction of negative environmental impacts by using solar energy more efficiently. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
