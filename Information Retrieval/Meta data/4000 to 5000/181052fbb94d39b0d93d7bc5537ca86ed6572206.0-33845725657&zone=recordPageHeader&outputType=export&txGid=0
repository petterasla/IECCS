As the empty space in the ductile cell is filled by an aqueous suspension of hydrophobic nanoporous silica gel, the work done by the compressive load along the axial direction can be dissipated not only through the ordinary cell-wall buckling but also via the extended yielding and the pressure-induced infiltration. As a result, the energy absorption efficiency, either on mass or on volumetric basis, is considerably improved. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Aqueous suspensions; Cell wall buckling; Ductile cells; Functionalized liquids; Ductility; Energy absorption; Hydrophobicity; Nanostructured materials; Silica gel; Suspensions (components); Volumetric analysis; Tubular steel structures",,,,,,"Lu, G., Yu, T., (2003) Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials, , CRC, Boca Raton, FL; Rosen, C.Z., Hiremath, B.V., Newnham, R.E., (1992) Piezoelectricity, , American Institute of Physics, New York; Kong, X., Qiao, Y., (2005) Philos.
