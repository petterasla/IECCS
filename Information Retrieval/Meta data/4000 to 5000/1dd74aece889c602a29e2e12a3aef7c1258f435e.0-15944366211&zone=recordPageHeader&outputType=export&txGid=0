R1N 3A1, Canada","Migrant songbirds are vulnerable to changes in climatic conditions on both the breeding and wintering grounds. For North American Neotropical migrants, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), via its effects on global precipitation and temperature, modulates the productivity of their temperate and tropical terrestrial ecosystems used during the course of their annual cycle. We evaluated how a densely nesting population of yellow warblers Dendroica petechia in a riparian forest in southern Manitoba, Canada, responded to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) between 1992 and 2001. Standardized mist netting was used to estimate apparent annual survival of adults and production of young. Both adult survival and the production of young were positively correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). More specifically, values of both these demographic parameters were lowest during El Niño years and highest during La Niña years. These findings demonstrate the influence of climate on populations of Neotropical migrants in North America. The more frequent El Niños predicted to result from future global climate change could negatively affect populations of yellow warblers and other Neotropical migrants breeding in this region. © Journal of Avian Biology.",,"climate change; ecological impact; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; migratory species; reproduction; songbird; survival; Canada; Manitoba; North America; Western Hemisphere; World; Dendroica petechia; Passeri; Riparia",,,,,,"Afton, A.D., Anderson, M.G., Declining scaup populations: A retrospective analysis of long-term population and harvest survey data (2001) J.
