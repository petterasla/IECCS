The chief advantage of the IAM approach over less complete modelling frameworks is that the socio-economic and environmental consequences of policy choices aimed at abating or adapting to climate change can be evaluated in their totality. However, the highly aggregate functional forms that IAMs currently embed are lacking in sufficient regional and sectoral detail to be totally credible. In this paper, ten reasons why regional studies are needed in support of the development of full-scale IAMs are given. A strategic cyclical scaling exercise involving regional and global integrated modelling frameworks is proposed.",,"climate change; environmental assessment; environmental policy; global change; global environmental change; integrated assessment model; modelling approach",,,,,,"Alcamo, G.J., Kreileman, J., Krol, J.S., Zuidema, G., Modelling the global society-biosphere-climate system: Part 1: Model description and testing (1994) Water, Air and Soil Pollution, 76, pp. 1-35; Barnett, H.J., Scarcity and growth revisited (1979) Scarcity and Growth Reconsidered, pp. 163-217. , ed.
