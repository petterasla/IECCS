Chickpea has a strong indeterminacy and continued growth of vegetative tissues during the later part of the reproduction period often delays maturity in high latitude areas. This study was conducted to determine the adaptability of chickpea and evaluate the relative importance of changing environments and optimizing crop management options in affecting crop maturity. Four cultivars were grown on barley and wheat stubble, and on summerfallow using rates of 0, 28, 64, 84, and 112 kg N ha-1 of fertilizer with and without Rhizobium inoculant at six environments in Saskatchewan, Canada, during 2004-2006. Maturity of chickpea ranged from 91 d in 2006 to 136 d in 2004. About 90% of the variation in maturity was due to environments, with the remaining variation related to cultivars, seedbed conditions, and soil fertility. The cultivars 'Amit' and 'CDC-Anna' matured 2-7 d earlier than 'CDC-Frontier' and 'CDC-Xena' averaged across diverse environments. Under cool and wet environments, chickpea grown on cereal stubble matured 7-15 d earlier than those grown on summerfallow; chickpea grown at moderate rates of N fertilizer (28-84 kg ha-1) without Rhizobium inoculant matured 15 d earlier than the crop receiving no-N fertilizer with or without inoculation. Under dry and hot environments, only marginal differences in maturity were observed among applied treatments. Our results indicate that chickpea maturity can be advanced as many as 15 days which can help minimize the risk of crop failure due to immaturity; this is achievable through the adoption of early-maturing cultivars, use of moderate rates of N fertilizer, and selection of cereal stubble as preferential seedbed. With current genotypes of chickpea, there is still considerably high risk of adapting this 'warm-season' crop in northern high latitude areas because of large environmental variability, but this risk might be reduced with continued global warming.
