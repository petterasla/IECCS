The economic significance of these data is discussed, together with the technical concept of fuel cell power stations and for transportation applications. The proposed fuel cell with generate power at much lower costs than conventional power plants, and a zero-emission vehicle with fuel cells will operate at lower fuel cost than a car with an internal combustion engine. The simple falling-film process leads to high power densities (6 kW/l) and low cost. The details given are valid for the use of hydrogen produced from fossil energy sources. Concentrated CO2, a byproduct of this technology can be stored in discussed oil and gas fields at a very low cost to avoid global warming. Thus, this 'down-to-earth' hydrogen technology is a free from CO2 emissions as solar-hydrogen technology. © 1994.",,"Automotive fuels; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Costs; Electrolysis; Storage battery vehicles; Technological forecasting; Technology transfer; Alkaline falling film fuel cell; Down to earth hydrogen technology; Half cells; Zero emission vehicle; Fuel cells",,,,,,"Staab, (1987) Chemie Ingenieur Technik, 59, pp. 316-319; Tetzlaff, Wendel, (1988) DECHEMA-Monogr., 112, pp. 325-337; Okken, (1989) Climate and Energy - The Feasibility of Controlling CO2 Emission, pp. 178-188. , Kluwer, Deventer; Carbon dioxide from flue gases for enhanced oil recovery (1988) Rep.
