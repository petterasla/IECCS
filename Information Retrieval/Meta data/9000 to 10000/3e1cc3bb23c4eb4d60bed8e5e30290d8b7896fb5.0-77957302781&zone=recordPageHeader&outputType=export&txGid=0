With an imminent global climate change threat, India will have difficulties in continuing with this rising energy use levels towards achieving high economic growth. It will have to follow an energy-efficient pathway in attaining this goal. In this context, an attempt is made to present India's achievements on the energy efficiency front by tracing the evolution of policies and their impacts. The results indicate that India has made substantial progress in improving energy efficiency which is evident from the reductions achieved in energy intensities of GDP to the tune of 88% during 1980-2007. Similar reductions have been observed both with respect to overall Indian economy and the major sectors of the economy. In terms of energy intensity of GDP, India occupies a relatively high position of nine among the top 30 energy consuming countries of the world. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy intensity","Economic growths; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Energy intensity; Energy use; Global climate changes; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Climate change; climate change; economic growth; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; energy use; policy implementation; India",,,,,,"(2007) India: Addressing Energy Security and Climate Change.
