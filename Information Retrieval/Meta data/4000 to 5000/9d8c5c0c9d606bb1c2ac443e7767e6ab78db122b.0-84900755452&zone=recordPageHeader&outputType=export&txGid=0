In the model named SAL(size-age-location), a forest at a geographic location has a patch-age structure, which approximates the shifting-gap mosaic, and a tree-size structure in each patch of the forest. Growth and recruitment occur in each patch and are regulated by patch-scale crowding in terms of upper basal area. Seed production depends on the basal area density of mother trees at the forest scale. Seeds are dispersed to neighboring locations of the geographic landscape. After a century-long warming treatment, a resident forest zone prevented, over several millennia, an invading forest zone from achieving a steady-state range of geographic distribution. Introducing the gap mosaic into the model did not make substantial changes in the response of latitudinal forest zones to the warming treatment, but only moderately accelerated the migration speed of invader species. Temporal fluctuation in seed production without interspecific synchronization, or the lottery effect, did not facilitate the migration of invader species at all. © The Ecological Society of Japan.","Gap mosaic; Global warming; Latitudinal gradient; Simulator; Temporal fluctuation",,,,,,,"Bugmann, H., A review of forest gap models (2001) Clim Change, 51, pp. 259-305; Chesson, P.L., Warner, R.R., Environmental variability promotes coexistence in lottery competitive systems (1981) Am Nat, 117, pp. 923-943; Friend, A.D., Stevens, A.K., Knox, R.G., Cannell, M.G.R., A process-based, terrestrial biosphere model of ecosystem dynamics (Hybrid v3.0) (1997) Ecol Model, 95, pp. 249-287; Hurtt, G.C., Moorcroft, P.R., Pacala, S.W., Levin, S.A., Terrestrial models and global change; challenges for the future (1998) Global Change Biol, 4, pp. 581-590; Kohyama, T., Simulating stationary size distribution of trees in rain forests (1991) Ann Bot, 68, pp. 173-180; Kohyama, T., Size-structured tree populations in gap-dynamic forest: The forest architecture hypothesis for the stable coexistence of species (1993) J Ecol, 81, pp. 131-143; Kohyama, T., Shigesada, N., A size-distribution-based model of forest dynamics along a latitudinal environmental gradient (1995) Vegetatio, 121, pp. 117-126; Kohyama, T., Suzuki, E., Partomihardjo, T., Yamada, T., Dynamic steady state of patch-mosaic tree-size strucuture of a mixed dipterocarp forest regulated by local crowding (2001) Ecol Res, 16, pp. 85-98; Levin, S.A., Population dynamic models in heterogeneous environments (1976) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 7, pp. 287-311; Liu, J., Ashton, P.S., FORMOSAIC: An individual-based spatially explicit model for simulating forest dynamics in landscape mosaics (1998) Ecol Model, 106, pp. 177-200; Moorcroft, P.R., Hurtt, G.C., Pacala, S.W., A method for scaling vegetation dynamics: The ecosystem demography model (ED) (2001) Ecol Monogr, 71, pp. 557-586; Pacala, S.W., Canham, C.D., Saponara, J., Silander, J.A., Kobe, R.K., Ribbens, E., Forest models defined by field measurements: Estimation, error analysis and dynamics (1996) Ecol Monogr, 66, pp. 1-43; Sinko, J.W., Streifer, W., A new model for age-size structure of a population (1967) Ecology, 48, pp. 910-918; Skellam, J.G., Random dispersal in theoretical populations (1951) Biometrika, 38, pp. 196-218; Suzuki, T., Forest transition as stochastic process I (1966) J Jpn Forest Soc, 48, pp. 436-439; Takenaka, A., Local coexistence of tree species and global distribution pattern along environmental gradient: A simulation study (2005) Ecol Res, 20. , present issue","Kohyama, T.; Frontier Research Center for Global Change, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, 3137-25 Showamachi, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0001, Japan; email: kohyama@ees.hokudai.ac.jp",,,"Springer Tokyo",,,,,,4431260749; 9784431260745,,,"English","Forest Ecosyst. and Environments: Scaling Up from Shoot Module to Watershed",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900755452
