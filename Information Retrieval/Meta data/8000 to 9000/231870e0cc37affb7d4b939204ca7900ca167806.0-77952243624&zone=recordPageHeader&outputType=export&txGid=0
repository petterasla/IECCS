Managers must therefore focus on supporting the natural resilience of reefs, requiring that resilient reefs and reef regions be identified. We develop a framework for assessing resilience and trial it by applying the framework to target management responses to climate change on the southern Great Barrier Reef. The framework generates a resilience score for a site based on the evaluation of 19 differentially weighted indicators known or thought to confer resilience to coral reefs. Scores are summed, and sites within a region are ranked in terms of (1) their resilience relative to the other sites being assessed, and (2) the extent to which managers can influence their resilience. The framework was applied to 31 sites in Keppel Bay of the southern Great Barrier Reef, which has a long history of disturbance and recovery. Resilience and 'management influence potential' were both found to vary widely in Keppel Bay, informing site selection for the staged implementation of resilience-based management strategies. The assessment framework represents a step towards making the concept of resilience operational to reef managers and conservationists. Also, it is customisable, easy to teach and implement and effective in building support among local communities and stakeholders for management responses to climate change. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Climate change; Coral reefs; Environmental management; Great Barrier Reef; Resilience","climate change; climate effect; coral reef; ecosystem management; ecosystem resilience; management practice; site selection; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Keppel Bay; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Carpenter, S.R., Rockstrom, J., Social-ecological resilience to coastal disasters (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1036-1039; Anthony, K.R.N., Enhanced energy status of corals on coastal, high-turbidity reefs (2006) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 319, p. 111; Anthony, K.R.N., Kerswell, A.P., Coral mortality following extreme low tides and high solar radiation (2007) Mar Biol, 151, pp. 1623-1631; Bellwood, D.R., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Nystrom, M., Confronting the coral reef crisis (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 827-833; Berkes, F., Hughes, T.P., Steneck, R.S., Wilson, J.A., Bellwood, D.R., Crona, B., Folke, C., Worm, B., Globalization, roving bandings and marine resources (2006) Science, 311, pp. 1557-1558; Carpenter, S., Walker, B., Anderies, J.M., Abel, N., From metaphor to measurement: Resilience of what to what?
