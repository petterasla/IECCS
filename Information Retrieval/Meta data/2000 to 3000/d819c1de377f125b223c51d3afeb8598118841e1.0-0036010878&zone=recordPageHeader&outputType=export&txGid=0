They can react with natural or man-made volatile organic compounds to produce smog, or else can be further oxidized to produce particulate haze, or acid rain that can eutrophy land and water. The reactive nitrogen that begins in the energy sector thus cascades through the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and soils before being eventually partially denitrifed to the global warming and stratospheric ozone-depleting gas nitrous oxide or molecular nitrogen. This paper will suggest how an economic analysis of the nitrogen cycle can identify the most cost-effective places to intervene. Nitrogen oxides released during fossil-fuel combustion in vehicles, power plants and heating boilers can either be controlled by add-on emission control technology, or can be eliminated by many of the same technical options that lead to carbon dioxide reduction. These integrated strategies also address sustainability, economic development and national security issues. Similarly in industrial production, it is more effective to focus on redesigning industrial processes rather than on nitrogen oxide pollution elimination from the current system. This paper will suggest which strategies might be utilized to address multiple benefits rather than focusing on single pollutants.",,"emission control; energy use; industrial regulation; nitrogen oxides; fossil fuel; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; acid rain; biomass; construction work and architectural phenomena; cost benefit analysis; economics; energy resource; environment; eutrophication; incineration; industry; pollution; review; technology; volatilization; Acid Rain; Biomass; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Environmental Pollution; Eutrophication; Facility Design and Construction; Fossil Fuels; Incineration; Industry; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Oxides; Technology Transfer; Volatilization",,"Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Acid Rain; Fossil Fuels; Nitrogen Oxides",,,,"(2001) Climate Change 2001, The Scientific Basis, Third Assessment Report, pp. 251-263. , Cambridge University Press; (2002) Air Trends 2000 Summary, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), , http://www.epa.gov/air/aqtrnd00/nitrox.html; (2001) Vital Signs 2001, pp. 40-41. , Norton and Company, New York; (2000) The UK National Air Quality Information Archive, , http://www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/airqual; Lomborg, B., (2001) The Skeptical Environmentalist, , Cambridge University Press. 174 pp; Bradley, M.J., Jones, B.M., Reducing global NOx emissions: Promoting the development of advanced energy and transportation technologies (2002) Ambio, 31, pp. 141-149; Melillo, J., Cowling, E., Reactive nitrogen and public policies for environmental protection (2002) Ambio, 31, pp. 150-158; National Ambient Air Quality Standards, , http://www.epa.gov/airs/criteria.html; (2001) North East States for Coordinated Air Use Management, , http://www.nescaum.org/.html; (2001), http://www.fletcher.tufts.edu/multilaterals.html(2001) Global Climate Change: Accomplishments and Goals, , http:/www.dupont.com/corp/news/posisions/global_climate.html; Ackerman, F., Biewald, B., White, D., Woolf, T., Moomaw, W., Grandfathering and coal plant emissions: The cost of cleaning up the Clean Air Act (1999) Energy Policy, 27, pp. 929-940; Casten, T., (2001) Power failure: Fixing the US power system to save trillions, clear the air and mitigate climate change, , Distributed paper","Moomaw, W.R.; Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tuffs University, Medford, MA 02155, United States; email: wmoomaw@attbi.com",,,,,,,,00447447,,AMBOC,12078008,"English","Ambio",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036010878
