For the California Current system, the Task Team described the physical processes, built an overview of species across trophic levels, and described how the population dynamics of these species have changed over time. Based on the synthesis work, conceptual models were developed describing the potential pathways linking climate forcing, oceanography, and species responses. The resultant empirical data scenarios draw on ecosystem histories to provide a synopsis of expected change given global climate change. The multidisciplinary team faced challenges and limitations in their attempt to draw connections between the outputs from global climate models (GCMs), the physical processes, and the subsequent impacts on species via the identified pathways. To some degree, there was a mismatch of variables that fishery scientists identified as important in determining species response to climate and physical forcing and the variables that current GCMs can now resolve at the regional level. These gaps will be important for researchers to consider as they begin to develop higher-resolution climate and regional oceanographic models for forecasting changes in species productivity. © 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","blue shark; California Current; Chinook salmon; climate change; Dover sole; empirical scenarios; mechanistic models; Pacific hake; Pacific sardine","climate change; climate modeling; ecosystem structure; empirical analysis; fish; fishery production; functional morphology; general circulation model; numerical model; oceanography; physiological response; population dynamics; resolution; trophic level; California Current; Pacific Ocean; Chondrichthyes; Merluccius productus; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Prionace glauca",,,,,,"Agostini, V.N., (2005) Climate, Ecology and Productivity of Pacific Sardine (Sardinops Sagax) and Hake (Merluccius Productus), p. 188. , PhD thesis University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; Agostini, V.N., Bakun, A., Francis, R.C., Larval stage controls on Pacific sardine recruitment variability: High zooplankton abundance linked to poor reproductive success (2007) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 345, pp. 237-244. , DOI 10.3354/meps06992; Agostini, V.N., Francis, R.C., Hollowed, A.B., Pierce, S.D., Wilson, C., Hendrix, A.N., The relationship between hake (Merluccius productus) distribution and poleward subsurface flow in the California Current system (2006) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 63, pp. 2649-2659; Alexander, M.A., Midlatitude atmosphere ocean interaction during El Niño: 1.
