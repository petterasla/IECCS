CH 4 has a global warming potential 21 times greater than CO 2; thus, it poses a serious environmental problem. As landfills are the main method for waste disposal in Malaysia, the major aim of this study was to estimate the total CH 4 emissions from landfills in all Malaysian regions and states for the year 2009 using the IPCC, 1996 first-order decay (FOD) model focusing on clean development mechanism (CDM) project applications to initiate emission reductions. Furthermore, the authors attempted to assess, in quantitative terms, the amount of CH 4 that would be emitted from landfills in the period from 1981-2024 using the IPCC 2006 FOD model. The total CH 4 emission using the IPCC 1996 model was estimated to be 318.8 Gg in 2009. The Northern region had the highest CH 4 emission inventory, with 128.8 Gg, whereas the Borneo region had the lowest, with 24.2 Gg. It was estimated that Pulau Penang state produced the highest CH 4 emission, 77.6 Gg, followed by the remaining states with emission values ranging from 38.5 to 1.5 Gg. Based on the IPCC 1996 FOD model, the total Malaysian CH 4 emission was forecast to be 397.7 Gg by 2020. The IPCC 2006 FOD model estimated a 201 Gg CH 4 emission in 2009, and estimates ranged from 98 Gg in 1981 to 263 Gg in 2024. © 2011 The Author(s).","clean development mechanism (CDM); emission inventory; landfills; Malaysian landfills; Methane emission","Anaerobic conditions; Clean Development Mechanism; Emission inventories; emission inventory; Emission reduction; Emission values; Environmental problems; First-order; Global warming potential; Landfill gas; Malaysia; Malaysians; Methane emission; Methane emissions; Northern regions; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Global warming; Land fill; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Waste disposal; methane; anoxic conditions; carbon dioxide; clean development mechanism; decomposition; emission inventory; forecasting method; global warming; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; numerical model; quantitative analysis; volume; waste disposal; air pollution; air pollution control; article; bioremediation; landfill; Malaysia; priority journal; waste disposal; Air Pollutants; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Malaysia; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Malaysia",,"methane, 74-82-8; Air Pollutants; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Chiemchaisri, C., Juanga, J.P., Visvanathan, C., Municipal solid waste management in Thailand and disposal emission inventory (2007) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 135 (1-3), pp. 13-20. , DOI 10.1007/s10661-007-9707-1; Christopherson, M., Kjedsen, P., Holst, L., Channton, J., Lateral gas transport in soil adjacent to an old landfill: Factors governing emissions and methan oxidation (2001) Waste Management and Research, 19, pp. 595-612; Cossu, R., Andreottola, G., Muntoni, A., Modelling of landfill gas production (1996) Landfilling of Waste: Biogas, pp. 237-268. , Christensen TH, Cossu R and Stegmann R (eds.)
