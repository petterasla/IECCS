The study shows that the transmission potential of both vector-borne diseases is very sensitive to climate changes on the periphery of the present endemic areas and at higher altitudes within these areas. The health impact will be most pronounced in populations living in the less economically developed temperate areas in which endemicity is low or absent. © 1995.",,"climate change; climatic change; global change model; health impact; malaria; man-environment relations; modelling approach; schistosomiasis; climate change; endemic disease; environment; global change; global climate; health; human; malaria; model; population; schistosomiasis",,,,,,"World Health Organization, (1990) Potential Health Effects of Climatic Change, , Geneva; McMichael, Global environmental change and human population health: a conceptual and scientific challenge for epidemiology (1993) International Journal of Epidemiology, 22 (1), pp. 1-8; World Health Organization, World malaria situation in 1990 (1992) World Health Statistics Quarterly, 45, pp. 257-266; World Health Organization, The control of schistosomiasis (1993) WHO Technical Report Series, 830, , Geneva; Bradley, Human tropical diseases in a changing environment (1993) Environmental Change and Human Health, pp. 147-170. , Ciba Foundation Symposium 175, Wiley, Chichester; Martens, Rotmans, Niessen, Climate Change and Malaria Risk: An Integrated Modelling Approach (1994) GLOBO Report Series No 3, RIVM Report No 461502003, , Bilthoven; Martens, Modelling the Effect of Global Warming on the Prevalence of Schistosomiasis (1995) GLOBO Report Series, RIVM Report, , Bilthoven; Martens, Niessen, Rotmans, Jetten, McMichael, Potential impact of global climate change on malaria risk (1995) Environmental Health Perspectives, 103 (5), pp. 458-464; Food and Agricultural Organization, Effects of Agricultural Development on Vector Borne Diseases (1987) WHO/FAO/UNEP Working Paper No AGL/MISC/12/87, , Rome; Carter, Parry, Harasawa, Nishioka, (1994) IPCC Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptions, , University College London and Center for Global Environmental Research, UK and Japan; Wilson, Mitchell, A doubled CO2 climate sensitivity experiment with a global climate model including a simple ocean (1987) Journal of Geophysical Research, 92 (13), pp. 315-343; Cubasch, Hasselmann, Hock, Maier-Reimer, Mikolajewicz, Santer, Sausen, Time-dependent greenhouse warming computations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model (1992) Climate Dynamics, 8, pp. 55-69; Greco, Moss, Viner, Jenne, (1994) Climate Scenarios and Socioeconomic Projections for IPCC WG II Assessment, , Printed by the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network; Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Weil, Kvale, Current research on geographical aspects of schistosomiasis (1985) Geographical Review, 74, pp. 186-216; Anderson, May, (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Dietz, Mathematical models for transmission and control of malaria (1988) Malaria, Principles and Practice of Malariology, 2, pp. 1091-1133. , WH Wernsdorfer, I McGregor, Churchill Livingstone, New York, NY; Anderson, May, Helminth infections of humans: mathematical models, population dynamics, and control (1985) Advances in Parasitology, 24, pp. 1-101; Anderson, May, (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Anderson, May, Helminth infections of humans: mathematical models, population dynamics, and control (1985) Advances in Parasitology, 24, pp. 1-101; Southwood, Habitat the templet for ecological strategies?
