These two types of models, however, were conceived and designed through different disciplines, for different purposes and lead to very different conclusions. Recent attempts to compare the two modelling approaches illustrate the difficulty in reconciling their results. In this paper, both modelling techniques are described and discussed, and the gap between their results is explored. © 1993.","Economics; Global warming; Top-down versus bottom-up modelling","Air pollution control; Costs; Economics; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Models; Public policy; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emission; Top down versus bottom up modelling; Greenhouse effect; comparative studies; emission reduction; global warming; modelling approach",,,,,,"Manne, Richels, CO2 emissions limits: an economic cost analysis for the USA (1990) The Energy Journal, 11 (2), pp. 51-59. , See; Manne, Richels, The costs of reducing US CO2 emissions - further sensitivity analyses (1990) The Energy Journal, 11 (4), pp. 69-78; Manne, Richels, Global CO2 emissions reductions - the impacts of rising energy costs (1991) The Energy Journal, 12 (1), pp. 87-107; Manne, Richels, Buying greenhouse insurance (1991) Energy Policy, 19 (6), pp. 543-552; Nordhaus, Count before you leap (1990) The Economist, pp. 19-22; Peck, Teisberg, CETA a model for carbon emissions trajectory assessment (1992) The Energy Journal, 13 (1), pp. 55-77; Burniaux, Martin, Nicoletti, Martins, Green: A Multi-region Dynamic General Equilibrium Model for Quantifying the Costs of Curbing CO2 Emissions: A Technical Manual (1991) Working Paper No 89, , OECD Department of Economics and Statistics, Paris; Lovins, Lovins, Least-cost climatic stabilization (1991) Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 16; Williams, Low-cost strategies for coping with CO2 emission limits (1991) The Energy Journal, 11 (3), pp. 35-59; EMF 12, (1992) Global Climate Change: Energy Sector Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Control Strategies, Executive Summary, , Draft No 1; Williams, Low-cost strategies for coping with CO2 emissions limits (1991) The Energy Journal, 11 (3), pp. 35-59. , See, for example; Manne, Richels, Estimating the energy conservation parameters: an experiment in backcasting (1990) Global 2100: the Economic Costs of CO2 Emissions Limits, , EPRI, Preliminary Draft; (1992) Global Environmental Change Report, 4 (8), p. 4; Shackleton, Shelby, Cristofaro, Brinner, Yanchar, Goulder, Jorgenson, Pauly, The Efficiency Value of Carbon Tax Revenues (1992) US EPA, presented at Energy Modeling Forum, , Stanford University; Shackleton, Shelby, Cristofaro, Brinner, Yanchar, Goulder, Jorgenson, Pauly, The Efficiency Value of Carbon Tax Revenues (1992) US EPA, presented at Energy Modeling Forum, , Stanford University; Fisher, Rothkopf, Market failure and energy policy: a rationale for selective conservation (1989) Energy Policy, pp. 397-406. , See, for example; Jochem, Gruber, Obstacles to rational electricity use and measures to alleviate them (1990) Energy Policy, pp. 340-350; Hirst, Brown, Closing the efficiency gap: barriers to the efficient use of energy (1990) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 3 (4), pp. 267-281; Northwest Power Planning Council (NWPPC), (1991) Northwest Conservation and Electric Power Plan, , NWPPC, Portland, OR; Lovins, Lovins, Least-cost climatic stabilization (1991) Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 16; Berry, The Administrative Costs of Energy Conservation Programs (1989) ORNL/CON-294, , See, for example, Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Bonneville Power Administration, (1989) 1990 Resource Plan, , Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Portland, OR; UNEP, (1991) National Greenhouse Costing Studies, , UNEP Collaborating Centre on Energy and Environment, Risø National Laboratory, Denmark; Nordhaus, The cost of slowing climate change a survey (1991) The Energy Journal, 12 (1), pp. 37-65; Nordhaus, The cost of slowing climate change a survey (1991) The Energy Journal, 12 (1), pp. 37-65. , The analysis year and BaU emissions for this study are not identified in the Nordhaus publication; Nordhaus, The cost of slowing climate change a survey (1991) The Energy Journal, 12 (1), pp. 37-65; Bodlund, Mills, Karlsson, Johansson, The challenge of choices: technology options for the Swedish electricity sector (1989) Electricity: Efficient End-Use and New Generation Technologies, and Their Planning Implications, , T.B.
