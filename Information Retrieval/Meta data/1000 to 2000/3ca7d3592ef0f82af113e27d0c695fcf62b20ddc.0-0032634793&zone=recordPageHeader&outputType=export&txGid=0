Skov, Inc","Skov, Arlie M., Arlie M. Skov, Inc","Long range concerns about depleting fossil fuel resources and more immediate concerns about global warming due to combustion weigh against the continued use of fossil fuels in favor of alternative energy resources. However, none of the alternatives, other than nuclear and hydropower, has the potential to supply more than a fraction of the demand. Hence, either natural limits on fossil fuel use set by depleting resources, or artificial limits, in an effort to control CO2 emissions, stand in dark contrast to the need for more energy consumption to improve the economic development of all nations particularly the poorer ones. These relationships are explored, identifying some of the hard choices that will inevitably impact the use of oil and gas.",,"Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Crude petroleum; Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; Fossil fuel resources; Petroleum industry",,,,,,,"Skov, Arlie M.; Arlie M.
