Although the resolution of the data is not sufficient to determine the phase relationship between the respective variations, it is generally believed that climate change occurred first as a result of the quasi-periodic variations of the Earth's orbital parameters. However, data and model results are consistent with the hypothesis that climate and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases interact via a positive feedback loop.The more recent increase in greenhouse gases since pre-industrial times can be related to human activities. Climate models predict a significant global warming of several degrees within the next century if the industrial emissions increase unabated. On the other hand, accelerated policies on emission control will significantly reduce the warming after a response time of a few decades. © 1992 Oxford University Press 1992.",,,,,,,,,"Roeckner, E.; Max-Planck-Institut fur Meteorologie, Bundesstrasse 55, D-2000 Hamburg 13, Germany",,,,,,,,00220957,,JEBOA,,"English","J.
