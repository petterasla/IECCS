Towards the end of the 21st century (i.e. 2091-2100), the average annual building energy use would be 6.6% and 8.1% more than that in 1979-2008 for low and medium forcing, respectively. Potential mitigation measures concerning the building envelope, internal condition, lighting load density (LLD) and chiller plant were considered. Thermal insulation to the external wall would not be effective to mitigate the expected increase in building energy use due to climate change. Controlling the amount of solar heat gain through the window would be a better option. Lowering the current LLD of 15W/m2 to about 13W/m2 would result in substantial energy savings because of the reduction in electricity consumption for both electric lighting and air-conditioning. As for the chiller plant, the coefficient of performance (COP) should be improved from the current minimum requirement of 4.7 to at least 5.5 to alleviate the impact of climate change. Raising the summer set point temperature (SST) to 25.5°C or higher would have high energy saving and hence mitigation potential, which could be readily applied to both new and existing buildings. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy use; General circulation models; Global warming; Mitigation measures; Office buildings; Principal component analysis","Building energy; Building envelopes; Chiller plants; Climate change impact; Coefficient of performance; Electricity-consumption; Emissions scenarios; Energy use; Existing building; External walls; General circulation model; High energy; Hong-kong; In-buildings; Lighting loads; Mitigation measures; Set-point temperatures; Solar heat gains; Substantial energy; Subtropical climates; Air conditioning; Cooling systems; Electric lighting; Energy conservation; Global warming; Office buildings; Thermal insulation; Principal component analysis; air conditioning; climate change; energy use; general circulation model; mitigation; principal component analysis; solar power; twenty first century; China; Hong Kong",,,,,,"(2007) IPCC Climate change 2007: the physical science basis, , Contribution of the working group I to the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, S.
