There is overwhelming evidence that repeated tillage is destroying the soil resource base and causing adverse environmental impacts. Tillage degrades the fertility of soils, causes air and water pollution, intensifies drought stress, destroys wildlife habitat, wastes fuel energy, and contributes to global warming. Consequently, most tillage-based systems in a dryland environment are not sustainable in the long-term. Today, dryland farmers are expected to produce food in ever greater quantities. This is becoming more difficult to do in view of declining soil quality, most of which is caused by soil tillage. It is becoming well documented scientifically that continuous no-till is the most effective, and practical approach for restoring and improving soil quality which is vital for sustained food production and a healthy environment. With this way of farming crop, residues or other organic amendments are retained on the soil surface and sowing/fertilizing is done with minimal soil disturbance. Research and farmers' experience indicate that with continuous no-till soil organic matter increases, soil structure improves, soil erosion is controlled, and in time crop yields increase substantially from what they were under tillage management, due to improved water relations and nutrient availability. These changes help to promote a cleaner and healthier environment and a more sustainable agriculture. A major obstacle that farmers often face with change to continuous no-till is overcoming yield-limiting factors during the transition years, that is, the first years of no-till following a history of intensive conventional tillage. These factors are often poorly understood and may be biologically-driven. Some of the problems involve residue management and increased weed and disease infestations. Farmer experience seems to indicate that many problems during the transition are temporary and become less important as the no-till system matures and equilibrates. The judicious use of crop rotations, cover crops and some soil disturbance may help reduce agronomic risks during the transition years. Farmers switching to continuous no-till must often seek new knowledge and develop new skills and techniques in order to achieve success with this new and different way of farming. Answers to their questions are urgently needed to provide strategies for promoting no-till as a way to enhance agricultural sustainability for future generations.","Farming systems; Organic matter; Rainfed; Semi-arid; Soil conservation; Soil quality; Tillage; Zero-till",,,,,,,"Bull, L., Delvo, H., Sandretto, C., Lindamood, B., Analysis of pesticide use by tillage systems in 1990, 1991, and 1992 (1993) Corn and Soybeans Agricultural Resources: Inputs, , U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, AR-32; Baker, C.J., Saxton, K.E., Ritchie, W.R., (1996) The Science and Practice of No-Tillage Seeding, 258p. , CAB International, Wallingford, Oxon, OX108DE, United Kingdom; Domitruk, D., Crabtree, B., (1997) Zero Tillage: Advancing the Art, , Manitoba-North Dakota Zero Tillage Farmers Association.
