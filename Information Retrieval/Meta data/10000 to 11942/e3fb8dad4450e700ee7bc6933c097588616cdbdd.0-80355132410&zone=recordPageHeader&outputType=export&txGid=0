These SSTs are in the form of ""permanent"" El Niño-like (herein termed ""El Padre"") and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)-like patterns. The Early Pliocene Warm Period, which bears similarity to future warming projections, may have also exhibited these Indo-Pacific SST patterns, as suggested by regional terrestrial paleo-climatic data and general circulation model studies. The ability to corroborate this assessment with paleo-data reconstructions is an advantage of the warm Pliocene period that is not afforded by future warming scenarios. Thus, the Pliocene period provides us with a warm-climate perspective and test bed for understanding potential changes to future atmospheric interactions given these altered SST states. This study specifically assesses how atmospheric teleconnections from El Padre/IOD SST patterns are generated and propagate to create the regional climate signals of the Pliocene period, as these signals may be representative of future regional climatic changes as well. To do this, we construct a holistic diagnostic rubric that allows us to examine atmospheric teleconnections, both energetically and dynamically, as produced by a general circulation model. We incorporate KE′, a diagnostic adapted from the eddy kinetic energy generation field, to assess the available energy transferred to these teleconnections. Using this methodology, we found that relative to our Modern Control experiments, weaker atmospheric teleconnections prevail under warm Pliocene conditions, although pathways of propagation still appear directed toward the southwestern United States from our tropical Pacific sector forcing. Propagation directly emanating from the Indian Ocean forcing sector appears to be largely blocked, although indirect teleconnective pathways appear traversing the Asian continent toward the North Pacific. The changes in the atmospheric circulation of Indian Ocean region in response to the underlying specified SST forcing (and indicated by Pliocene paleo-data) may have a host of implications for energy transfer out of and into the region, including interactions with the Asian jet stream and changes to the seasonal monsoon cycle. These interactions warrant further study in both past and future warm climate scenarios. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","El Niño; El Padre; Indian Ocean dipole; Pliocene; Teleconnections","atmospheric general circulation model; climate forcing; climate oscillation; climate signal; climate variation; El Nino; paleoclimate; Pliocene; reconstruction; sea surface temperature; teleconnection; warming; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); United States",,,,,,"Abram, N.J., Gagan, M.K., Cole, J.E., Hantoro, W.S., Mudelsee, M., Recent intensification of tropical climate variability in the Indian Ocean (2008) Nature Geoscience, 1, pp. 849-853; Annamalai, H., Okajima, H., Watanabe, M., Possible impact of the Indian Ocean SST on the northern hemisphere circulation during El Niño (2007) J Clim, 20, pp. 3164-3189; Ashok, K., Guan, Z., Yamagata, T., Impact of the Indian Ocean dipole on the relationship between the Indian monsoon rainfall and ENSO (2001) Geophys Res Lett, 28, pp. 4499-4502; Ashok, K., Guan, Z., Saji, N.H., Individual and combined influences of ENSO and the Indian Ocean dipole on the Indian summer monsoon (2004) J Clim, 17, pp. 3141-3155; Ashok, K., Behera, S.K., Rao, S.A., Weng, H., Yamagata, T., El Niño Modoki and its possible teleconnection (2007) J Geophys Res, 112, pp. C11007. , doi:10.1029/2006JC003798; Balachandran, N.K., Rind, D., Modeling the effects of UV variability and the QBO on the troposphere/stratosphere system.
