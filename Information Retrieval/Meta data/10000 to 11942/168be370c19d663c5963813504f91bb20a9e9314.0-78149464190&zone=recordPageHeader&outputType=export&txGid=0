Many trees were felled by wind, most others were stripped of leaves and branches, and the canopy opened considerably (57%). Blackberry thickets sprouted and expanded to cover almost all of what was previously a patchily open forest understory. The bird community changed distinctively following the hurricane, driven primarily by increased density of species that prefer dense understory (regenerating) habitat. Individual species that increased significantly in density included one year-round resident, Carolina wren, and five breeding migrants, white-eyed vireo, Swainson's warbler, Kentucky warbler, hooded warbler, and yellow-breasted chat. These patterns were predictable responses to the opened canopy and increased density of understory vegetation. However, over three years following the storm, most species, especially canopy breeders, showed no distinct numerical response to the hurricane, which suggests that the initial bird community was resistant to hurricane disturbance. Only one species, Acadian flycatcher, declined significantly after the hurricane, presumably because of loss of its preferred open understory breeding and feeding habitat. Our results thus document and reinforce the important role hurricanes play along the Gulf coast in structuring forest bird communities by altering understory habitat. We expect habitat changes will continue as invasive plant species further change forest community structure, and as large storms increase in frequency in relation to global climate change. Thus, we also expect continued changes to the bird community, which may include additional future declines. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Birds; Coastal forest; Disturbance; Gulf coast; Hurricanes; Katrina; Louisiana","Coastal forest; Disturbance; Gulf coast; Katrina; Louisiana; Climate change; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Hurricanes; Reforestation; Storms; Vegetation; Watersheds; Birds; breeding population; climate change; coastal zone; community structure; disturbance; habitat loss; Hurricane Katrina 2005; invasive species; patch dynamics; population decline; regeneration; songbird; swamp forest; understory; Birds; Climates; Coasts; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Louisiana; Plants; Reforestation; Water Sheds; Gulf Coast [United States]; Louisiana; Pearl Basin; United States; Aves; Empidonax virescens; Icteria virens; Oporornis formosus; Rubus; Thryothorus; Vireo griseus; Wilsonia (Aves)",,,,,,"Baldwin, M.J., (2005), Winter bird use of the Chinese tallow tree in Louisiana.
