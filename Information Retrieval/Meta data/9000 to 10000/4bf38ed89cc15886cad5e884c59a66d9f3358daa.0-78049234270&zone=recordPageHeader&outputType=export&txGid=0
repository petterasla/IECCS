Landfill emissions have been identified among the major contributors of global warming and climate changes with significant impact in national economies. The energy industry constitutes an additional greenhouse gas emitter, while at the same time it is characterized by significant costs and uncertain fuel prices. The above implications have triggered different policies and measures worldwide to address the management of municipal solid wastes on the one hand and the impacts from energy production on the other. Emerging methods of energy recovery from waste may address both concerns simultaneously. In this work a comparative study of co-generation investments based on municipal solid waste is presented, focusing on the evolution of their economical performance over time. A real-options algorithm has been adopted investigating different options of energy recovery from waste: incineration, gasification and landfill biogas exploitation. The financial contributors are identified and the impact of greenhouse gas trading is analysed in terms of financial yields, considering landfilling as the baseline scenario. The results indicate an advantage of combined heat and power over solely electricity production. Gasification, has failed in some European installations. Incineration on the other hand, proves to be more attractive than the competing alternatives, mainly due to its higher power production efficiency, lower investment costs and lower emission rates. Although these characteristics may not drastically change over time, either immediate or irreversible investment decisions might be reconsidered under the current selling prices of heat, power and CO2 allowances. © The Author(s) 2010.","combined heat and power; emissions trading; energy recovery; investment analysis; Waste management","Co-generation; Combined heat and power; Comparative studies; Electricity production; Emission rates; Emissions Trading; Energy industry; Energy productions; Energy recovery; Fuel prices; investment analysis; Investment costs; Irreversible investments; Landfilling; Municipal Solid Waste; National economy; Optimal investment decision; Power production; Selling prices; Significant impacts; Social concerns; Biogas; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Energy conversion; Gas generators; Gasification; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Recovery; Risk assessment; Solid wastes; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Investments; biogas; carbon dioxide; algorithm; carbon dioxide; cogeneration; electricity generation; emissions trading; global warming; greenhouse gas; incineration; industrial investment; landfill; municipal solid waste; national economy; price dynamics; waste management; algorithm; article; climate change; comparative study; economics; electricity; energy conversion; energy recovery; energy resource; energy yield; gasification; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heat; incineration; investment; landfill; municipal solid waste; power supply; priority journal; solid waste; solid waste management; stochastic model; Algorithms; Conservation of Energy Resources; Global Warming; Incineration; Refuse Disposal",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"(2009) ACMAR Association of Communities and Municipalities of the Attica Region, , www.esdkna.gr, Accessed 11 September 2009; Barlow, M.T., A diffusion model for electricity prices (2002) Mathematical Finance, 12, pp. 287-298; Brennan, M.J., Schwartz, E., Evaluating natural resource investments (1985) Journal of Business, 58, pp. 135-157; Clewlow, L., Strickland, C., (2000) Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management, , London: Lacima Publications; Dixit, A., Pindyck, R., (1994) Investment under Uncertainty, , Princeton, NJ, USA: Princeton University Press; Fuss, S., Szolgayova, J., Obersteiner, M., Gusti, M., Investment under market and climate policy uncertainty (2008) Applied Energy, 85, pp. 708-721; (2009) General Secretariat of National Statistical Service of Greece, , www.statistics.gr, Accessed 10 September 2009; Glasserman, G., (2004) Monte-Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering.
