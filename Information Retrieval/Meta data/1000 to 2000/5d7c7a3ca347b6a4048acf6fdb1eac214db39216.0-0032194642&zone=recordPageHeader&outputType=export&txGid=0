Most of the land that was under forest cover at the turn of the nineteenth century is now covered with plantation crops. The districts of Kandy, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Ratnapura and Kegalle are the main hill country plantation areas. Within a period of less than half a century most of the forests in the hill country were cleared for plantation crops. Shifting cultivation was responsible for deforestation in the drier parts of the hill country. At the time of the British conquest of the hill country, the population of the whole island was not more than 3/4 to 1 million and they had settled in isolated villages at elevations below 1066 m. Subsistence agriculture was the main occupation of this predominantly rural population. During the first phase (1830-1880) of the plantation industry, large tracts of mostly forest land were cleared for coffee cultivation. By 1878, the extent of the coffee plantations reached its maximum of 111 336 ha most of which was situated in the wet zone hill country. The second phase of plantation agriculture began as the coffee industry was completely wiped out by a leaf disease. Most of the abandoned coffee plantations and the remaining forests were converted to tea, rubber and cinchona estates. The first two crops managed to survive price fluctuations in the world market, while the latter collapsed because of over production. During the period of large-scale deforestation in the hill country, the climate also underwent changes as exemplified by rainfall and temperature trends. However, these trends are not uniform everywhere in the plantation areas of the hill country. The temperature has risen a few degrees over a period of about a century and quarter in the hill country stations, while rainfall has declined significantly at some stations. These changes seem to be a result of the interaction of both global and local factors. Although some of these changes would have been a result of global warming, land use change would also have contributed to regional disparities.","Agricultural development; Climate change; Deforestation; Environmental degradation; Man-environment relations; Plantation; Sri Lanka","Deforestation; Shifting cultivation; Cultivation; Global warming; Land use; Rain; Vegetation; Forestry; agricultural development; climate change; deforestation; environmental degradation; man-environment relations; plantation; Sri Lanka",,,,,,"Cook, E.K., (1931) Ceylon, Its Geography, Its Resources and Its People, pp. 84-99. , Macmillan, London; Deraniyagala, S.U., Archaeological survey of Ceylon Part I: Horton Plains (1972) Spolia Zeylanica, 321, pp. 13-23; Kayane, I., Nakagawa, K., Edagawa, H., Madduma Bandara, C.M., Hydrological consequences of global warming revealed by the century-old climatological data in Sri Lanka and South India (1995) An Interim Report of IGBP Activities in Japan, pp. 61-81. , Japan National Committee for IGBP (ed.), University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba; Lyons, T.J., The meteorological impact of replacing native perennial vegetation with an annual agricultural species (1996) Proceedings of IGBP/BAHC-LUCC Joint Inter-Core Projects Symposium on Interactions between the Hydrological Cycle and Land Use/Cover, pp. 216-219. , Kayane, I.
