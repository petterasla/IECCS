The rapid growth of atmospheric methane has gained attention of governments and scientists. All countries in the world now deal with global climate change as an important task of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, but the need for monitoring the concentration of methane gas, in particular precision monitoring, can be scientifically formulated to provide a scientific basis for emission reduction measures. So far, CH4 gas emissions of different animal production systems have received extensive research. The methane emission by ruminant reported in the literature is only estimation. This is due to the various factors that affect the methane production in ruminant, there are various variables associated with the techniques for measuring methane production, the techniques currently developed to measure methane are unable to accurately determine the dynamics of methane emission by ruminant, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop an accurate method for this purpose. Currently, spectroscopy technique has been used and is relatively a more accurate and reliable method. Various spectroscopy techniques such as modified infrared spectroscopy methane measuring system, laser and near-infrared sensory system are able to achieve the objective of determining the dynamic methane emission by both domestic and grazing ruminant. Therefore spectroscopy technique is an important methane measuring technique, and contributes to proposing reduction methods of methane.","Fiber transducer; Gas-absorb spectrum; Laser technology; Methane; Ruminant","Atmospheric chemistry; Chemical engineering; Climatology; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Infrared spectroscopy; Lasers; Leakage (fluid); Methane; Monitoring; Piezoelectric transducers; Spectroscopic analysis; Animal production systems; Atmospheric methanes; Chemical process; Concentration of; Emission reductions; Global climate changes; Laser technology; Measuring systems; Measuring techniques; Methane emissions; Methane gas; Methane productions; Near infra reds; Precision monitoring; Radiation process; Rapid growths; Reduction methods; Ruminant; Ruminant methanes; Sensory systems; Emission spectroscopy; methane; animal; bovids; greenhouse effect; metabolism; methodology; review; spectroscopy; Animals; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Ruminants; Spectrum Analysis",,"methane, 74-82-8; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Wei, X.-L., Lu, Y.-H., Gao, M.-G., (2007) Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis, 27 (4), p. 668; Zhang, X.-J., (2004) Journal of Shenyang College of Education, 6 (1), p. 132; Zhang, R.-J., Wagn, M.-X., Li, J., (1999) Climatic and Environmental Research, 4 (2), p. 192; Fang, J.-Y., Chen, A.-P., Peng, C.-H., (2001) Science, 292, p. 2320; Khalil, M.A.K., Shearer, M.J., (1993) Chemosphere, 26, p. 1; Tao, Z., (1993) Agro-Environmental Protection, 12 (5), p. 193; Dong, H.-M., Lin, E.-D., Yang, Q.-C., (1995) Rural Eco-Environment, 11 (3), p. 4; Zhang, Y.-T., Fang, D.-L., (1999) Chinese Journal of Animal Science, 35 (1), p. 47; Mills, J.A.N., Kebreab, E., Yates, C.M., (2003) J.
