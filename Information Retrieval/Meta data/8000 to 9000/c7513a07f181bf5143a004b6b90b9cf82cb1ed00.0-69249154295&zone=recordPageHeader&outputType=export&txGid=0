However, droughtinduced tree mortality cannot be predicted with confidence, because long-term field observations of plant water stress prior to, and culminating in, mortality are rare, precluding the development and testing of mechanisms. Here, we document plant water stress in two widely distributed, co-occurring species, piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma), over more than a decade, leading up to regional-scale die-off of piñon pine trees in response to global change-related drought. Piñon leaf water potentials remained substantially below their zero carbon assimilation point for at least 10 months prior to dying, in contrast to those of juniper, which rarely dropped below their zero-assimilation point. These data suggest that piñon mortality was driven by protracted water stress, leading to carbon starvation and associated increases in susceptibility to other disturbances (eg bark beetles), a finding that should help to improve predictions of mortality during drought. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"beetle; climate change; communication; coniferous tree; drought stress; environmental disturbance; global change; measurement method; mortality; plant water relations; research; water stress; Coleoptera; Juniperus; Juniperus monosperma; Pinus edulis; Scolytinae; Tillandsia lineatispica; Juniperus; Juniperus monosperma; Pinus edulis; Scolytinae",,,,,,"Allen, C.D., Interactions across spatial scales among forest dieback, fire, and erosion in northern New Mexico landscapes (2007) Ecosystems, 10, pp. 797-808; Allen, C.D., Breshears, D.D., Drought-induced shift of a forest-woodland ecotone: Rapid landscape response to climate variation (1998) P Natl Acad Sci USA, 95, pp. 14839-14842; Breshears, D.D., Structure and function of woodland mosaics: Consequences of patch-scale heterogeneity and connectivity along the grassland-forest continuum (2008) Western North American Juniperus communities.
