It was found that the pan evaporation in Sdom has recently increased by 20-25%. In this paper we explore the reasons for this increase. It is found that both large-scale and local climatic changes have contributed to the evaporation increase in the Dead Sea Valley. The large-scale (global) change potentially associated with the global warming, resulted in changes of the frequencies of some synoptic systems in the region. The local change is a result of the recent Dead-Sea drying, which reduced the local Dead-Sea breeze while intensifying the Mediterranean-Sea breeze penetrating the Dead Sea Valley. It is suggested that while the local effect was the dominant climatic change factor in the Dead-Sea Valley in the 1970-1990, the global effect becomes the dominant one in the more recent evaporation increase in the Dead-Sea. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climatic changes; Climatic effects; Dead Sea; Global effects; Local effects; Meteorological parameters; Natural evaporation; Pan evaporation; Sea breeze; Synoptic systems; Evaporation; Global warming; Landforms; Phase transitions; evaporation; frequency analysis; global warming; meteorology; Dead Sea",,,,,,"Alpert, P., Eppel, A., A proposed index for mesoscale activity (1985) J Clim Appl Meteorol, 24, pp. 472-480; Alpert, P., Cohen, A., Neumann, J., Doron, E., A model simulation of the summer circulation from the Eastern Mediterranean past Lake Kinneret in the Jordan Valley (1982) Mon Weather Rev, 100, pp. 994-1006; Alpert, P., Shafir, H., Issahary, D., Recent changes in the climate of the Dead Sea Valley (1997) Clim Change, 7, pp. 1-25; Alpert, P., Osetinsky, I., Ziv, B., Shafir, H., Semi-objective classification for daily synoptic systems: application to the Eastern Mediterranean climate change (2004) Int J Climatol, 24, pp. 1001-1011; Alpert, P., Price, C., Krichak, S., Ziv, B., Saaroni, H., Osetinsky, I., Mediterranean climate and some tropical teleconnections (2006) Nuovo Cimento Soc Ital Fis C Geophys Space Phys, 29 (1), pp. 89-97; Alpert, P., Krichak, S., Shafir, H., Jin, F., Kalmikov, A., Sharon, A., Dayan, M., Lati, Y., (2006) The impact of the sea canal on the Dead-Sea evaporation.
