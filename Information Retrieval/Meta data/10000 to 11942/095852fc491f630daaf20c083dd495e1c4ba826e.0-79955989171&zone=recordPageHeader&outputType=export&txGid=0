Farmers' grow upland crops like chickpea (Cicer arietinum), greengram (Vigna radiate), mustard (Brassica nigra), corn (Zea maize), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), potato (Solanum tuberosum), sunflower (Helianthus annuus) etc. along with rice (Oryza sativa) during the dry season. However, knowledge of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from these rice based cropping systems is very limited. In the present study four rice based cropping systems was studied along with rice-rice rotation system as control in respect of GHG emission, yield potential and economic feasibility. Conventional plantation and fertilizer application methodology was followed for each crop. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux from field plots were studied with conventional closed chamber method using gas chromatograph. CH4 flux was recorded highest from rice-rice rotation plots (304.25 kg ha-1). N2O flux was recorded 1.02 kg ha-1 from rice-rice rotation system during wet season. However, during wet season, higher N2O flux (1. 93 kg ha-1) was recorded from rice-potato-sesame rotation plots. Annual N2O flux was also recorded significantly low (3.42 kg ha-1) from rice-rice rotation plots and high (6.19 kg ha-1) from rice-chickpea-greengram rotation plots. Significantly lower annual grain yield was recorded from rice-rice rotation plots (9.25 Mg ha-1) whereas it was 18.84 Mg rice eq ha-1 from rice-potato-sesame rotation system. The global warming potential (GWP) of rice-rice rotation system was recorded significantly high (8.62 Mg CO2 ha-1) compare to plots with different rice based cropping systems. Computing all C-emission from cradle-to-grave, highest total C-cost was recorded from the rice-rice rotation system ($62.00 ha-1). We have made an attempt to calculate the C-credit of different rice based cropping systems by considering the difference of C-cost with control. The study suggests that the rice-potato-sesame is most sustainable among different cropping system studied in terms of economic profit ($1248.21 ha-1) and C-credit ($38.60 ha-1). The result of the study may be limited to the study region; however, the study has potential use in respect to the development of agriculture practice for adaptation to climate change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","C-cost; C-credit; CH4 flux; GWP; Irrigated rice based cropping system; N2O flux","agricultural practice; climate change; crop rotation; crop yield; cultivation; greenhouse gas; high temperature; legume; methane; nitrous oxide; potato; precipitation intensity; rainfall; rice; India; Brassica nigra; Cajanus cajan; Cicer arietinum; Helianthus; Helianthus annuus; Oryza sativa; Sesamum indicum; Solanum tuberosum; Vigna; Zea; Zea mays",,,,,,"Adhya, T.K., Rath, A.K., Gupta, P.K., Rao, V.R., Das, S.N., Parida, K., Parashar, D.C., Sethunathan, N., Methane emission from flooded rice paddy fields under irrigated condition (1994) Biol Fertil Soils, 18, pp. 245-248; Adhya, T.K., Mishra, S.R., Rath, A.K., Bharati, K., Mohanty, S.R., Ramakrishnan, B., Rao, V.R., Sethunathan, N., Methane efflux from rice-based cropping systems under humid tropical conditions of eastern India (2000) Agr Ecosyst Environ, 79, pp. 85-90; Arnold, S.L., Parkin, T.B., Doran, J.W., Eghball, B., Mosier, A.R., Automated gas sampling system for laboratory analysis of CH4 and N2O (2001) Commun Soil Sci Plant Anal, 32, pp. 2795-2807; Arnold, K.V., Nilsson, M., Hånell, B., Weslien, P., Klemedtsson, L., Fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from drained organic soils in deciduous forests (2005) Soil Biol Biochem, 37, pp. 1059-1071; Aulakh, M.S., Khera, S.T., Doran, J.W., Bronson, K.F., Denitrification, N2O and CO2 fluxes in rice-wheat cropping system as affected by crop residues, fertilizer N and legume green manure (2001) Biol Fertil Soil, 34, pp. 375-389; Ball, B.C., Scott, A., Parker, J.P., Field N2O, CO2 and CH4 fluxes in relation to tillage, compaction and soil quality in Scotland (1999) Soil Till Res, 53, pp. 29-39; Baggs, E.M., Rees, R.M., Smith, K.A., Vinten, A.J.A., Nitrous oxide emission from soils after incorporating crop residues (2000) Soil Use Manag, 16, p. 82; Baggs, E.M., Stevenson, M., Pihlatie, M., Regar, A., Cook, H., Cadisch, G., Nitrous oxide emissions following application of residues and fertilizer under zero and conventional tillage (2003) Plant Soil, 254, pp. 361-370; Bardhan Roy, S.K., Walker, T., Khatna, V.S., Saha, N.K., Verma, V.S., Kadian, M.S., Haverkort, A.J., Bowen, W., (1998) Intensification of potato production in rice-based cropping systems: A rapid rural appraisal in West Bengal, , CIP annual report 1997-98; Bowden, R.D., Steudler, P.A., Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., Annual nitrous oxide fluxes from temperate forest soils in the Northeastern (1990) J Geophys Res, 95, pp. 13997-14005; Chen, H.W., Yen, J.H., Chung, R.S., Lai, C.M., Yang, S.S., Wang, S.S., Carbon dioxide flux densities in cultivated rice paddy fields (2001) Proc Natl Sci Counc Republic of China, 25 (4), pp. 239-247; Clément, J.C., Pinay, G., Marmonier, P., Seasonal dynamics of denitrification along topohydrosequences in three different riparian wetlands (2002) J Environ Qual, 31, pp. 201-210; The two faces of sustainability (2003) Fuzzy evaluation of sustainable development, , Cornelissen AGM.
