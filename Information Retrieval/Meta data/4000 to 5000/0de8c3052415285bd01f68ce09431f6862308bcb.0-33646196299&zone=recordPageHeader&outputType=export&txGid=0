The commonly accepted range for the equilibrium global mean temperature change in response to a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration1, termed climate sensitivity, is 1.5-4.5 K (ref. 2). A number of observational studies3-10, however, find a substantial probability of significantly higher sensitivities, yielding upper limits on climate sensitivity of 7.7 K to above 9 K (refs 3-8). Here we demonstrate that such observational estimates of climate sensitivity can be tightened if reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature over the past several centuries are considered. We use large-ensemble energy balance modelling and simulate the temperature response to past solar, volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing to determine which climate sensitivities yield simulations that are in agreement with proxy reconstructions. After accounting for the uncertainty in reconstructions and estimates of past external forcing, we find an independent estimate of climate sensitivity that is very similar to those from instrumental data. If the latter are combined with the result from all proxy reconstructions, then the 5-95 per cent range shrinks to 1.5-6.2 K, thus substantially reducing the probability of very high climate sensitivity. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Probability; Climate sensitivity; Energy balance; Greenhouse gas; Instrumental data; Global warming; carbon dioxide; atmospheric modeling; climate change; climate modeling; global warming; greenhouse gas; air temperature; article; climate; concentration (parameters); energy balance; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; model; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; simulation",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Schneider, S.H., Dickinson, R.E., Climate modeling (1974) Rev.
