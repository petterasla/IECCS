The life cycle GHG emissions from the production and use of PME were found to be 79.5% less than that from diesel production and use. Hence, a fuel switch from diesel to PME, according to the Thai government’s plan of using a 10% blend of biodiesel countrywide by 2012, will contribute to reducing global warming potential by 7.8 million tonne CO2-eq per year as well as reducing crude oil imports. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","biodiesel; global warming; oil palm plantation; palm methyl ester; palm oil; PME",,,,,,,"Bernesson, S., Nilsson, D., Hansson, P., A limited LCA comparing large- and small-scale production of Rape Methyl Ester (RME) under Swedish conditions (2004) Biomass and Bioenergy, 26, pp. 545-559; (1996) Ökoinventare für Verpackungen.
