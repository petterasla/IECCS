The calculation was based on inventory and activity data obtained from statistics, literature sources and inquiry reports for the year 2005. The total C resources from crop residues and manure in Japan were 6.1 Tg C year-1 and 2.3 Tg C year-1, of which 4.9 Tg C year-1 and 1.9 Tg C year-1, respectively, were applied to farmland soil. The average C application rate was 1. 7 ± 1.6 Mg C ha farmland-1 year-1 and the proportion of manure was 23 ± 26%. One scenario that improved the allocation of manure and crop residue input to farmland soil increased the average C input to farmland soil to 1.8 ± 1.3 Mg C ha farmland-1 year-1. This agricultural C flow represented only a small percentage of the global warming potential of the whole of Japan. Thus, management of C resources in the agricultural sector should focus on the sustainable use of soil rather than the C sequestration potential of soil. To improve the C flow for areas with high C input, the transportation of manure to neighboring municipalities failed to reduce the excessive amount of manure since those areas are concentrated in only a few regions. Other measures were required to reduce environmental problems due to the over-supply of manure to farmland soils. For areas with low C input, the introduction of green manure, changes in cultivation methods, and land use type itself must be considered in relation to the individual C requirements specific to land use, soil type and climate conditions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon flow; Carbon input; Crop residue; Farmland soil; Manure; Municipality scale","agricultural land; agricultural soil; climate conditions; concentration (composition); crop residue; cultivation; global warming; green manuring; land use; manure; soil carbon; soil type; sustainable development; Japan",,,,,,"Arrouays, D., Balesdent, J., Germon, J.C., Jayet, P.A., Soussana, J.F., Stengel, P., (2002) Contribution à La Lutte Contre L'effet De Serre, , (in French), INRA, Paris: Stocker du carbone dans les sols agricoles de France; Japanese green house gas inventory (ed) Greenhouse Gas Inventory Office, Ministry of Environment (2009), Center for Global Environmental Research, Center for Global Environmental Research, Tokyo (in Japanese)Dendoncker, N., van Wesemael, B., Rounsevell, M.D.A., Roelandt, C., Lettens, S., Belgium's CO2 mitigation potential under improved cropland management (2004) Agr Ecosys Environ, 103, pp. 101-116; Duiker, S.W., Lal, R., Carbon budget study using CO2 flux measurements from a no till system in central Ohio (2000) Soil Till Res, 54, pp. 21-30; Falloon, K., Smith, P., Bradley, R.I., Milne, R., Tomlinson, R., Viner, D., Livermore, M., Brown, T., RothCUK-a dynamic modeling system for estimating changes in soil C from mineral soils at 1-km resolution in the UK (2006) Soil Use Manag, 22, pp. 274-288; Follet, R.F., Soil management concepts and carbon sequestration in cropland soils (2001) Soil Till Res, 61, pp. 77-92; Freibauer, A., Rounsevell, M.D.A., Smith, P., Verhagen, J., Carbon sequestration in the agricultural soils of Europe (2004) Geoderma, 122, pp. 1-23; Hojito, M., Ikeguchi, A., Kohyama, K., Shimada, K., Ogino, A., Mishima, S., Kaku, K., Estimation of nitrogen loading in Japanese prefectures and scenario testing of abatement strategies (2003) Jpn J Soil Sci Plant Nutr, 74, pp. 467-474. , (in Japanese); Climate Change 2007 (2007) The Physical Scientific Basis.
