The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced a major scientific assessment of climatic change. They concluded that, despite uncertainties, the model simulations of a warming due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases are broadly consistent with observations of global temperature changes. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas from human activities. Increases in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere contribute over half of the enhanced greenhouse effect, the rest being mainly due to increases in halocarbons and methane. The total effect of greenhouse gas emissions depends on their lifetimes in the atmosphere. The global warming potential of other greenhouse gases is expressed relative to that of CO2. However, the lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere is complicated by uptake into the many carbon storage sinks of the global carbon cycle. Knowledge of the global carbon cycle is incomplete, the sources exceeding the sum of known sinks. Reductions in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere could be achieved by reducing the emissions or enlarging the sinks. What is achieved in future will depend to a large extent on a more detailed understanding of carbon storage mechanisms. © 1993.","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climatic change; general circulation models; global warming potential; greenhouse gases","Air pollution control; Climatology; Combustion; Gaseous effluents; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Carbon cycle; Climate change; General circulation models; Global warming potential; Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC); Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Bretherton, Bryan, Woods, Time-dependent greenhouse-gas-induced climate change (1990) Climate change: the IPCC scientific assessment, pp. 173-193. , J.T.
