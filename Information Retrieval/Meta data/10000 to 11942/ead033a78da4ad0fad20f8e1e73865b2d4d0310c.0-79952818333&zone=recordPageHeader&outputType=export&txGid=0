The proximity of biomass source and biochar dispersal greatly reduces the energy and emissions footprint of the whole process. The viability of the whole biochar process is examined from two boundary points: is there enough biomass around to have significant impact on the atmospheric CO2 levels and is there enough soil area for biochar dispersal. The answers are soundly positive, both for the world as a whole and for Canada, for which a more detailed analysis was done. However, the massive adoption of biochar solution is critically dependent on proper recognition of its carbon sequestration impact its soil improvement potentials. To that extent the International Biochar Initiative, together with national chapters, including recently formed Canadian Biochar Initiative, are actively promoting biochar related research and policy framework. This paper addresses the questions of availability of sources and sites that would benefit from its dispersal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biochar; Biomass; Carbon sequestration; Forest fire; Forestry; Global warming","Atmospheric carbon; Atmospheric CO; Biochar; Biomass source; Boundary points; Carbon sequestration; Distributed energies; Forest fire; Policy framework; Significant impacts; Soil improvement; Whole process; Agriculture; Biomass; Deforestation; Fires; Global warming; Timber; Soils; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; charcoal; energy efficiency; forest fire; forestry; global change; policy making; soil management; Canada",,,,,,"(2008) IPCC 2007: contribution of working group I to the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, S.
