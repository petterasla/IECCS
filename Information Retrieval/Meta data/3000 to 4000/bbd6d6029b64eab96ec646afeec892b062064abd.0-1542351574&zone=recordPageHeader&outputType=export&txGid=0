Previous work has shown that a projected warming would result in a reduction of snowpack storage leading to higher winter and lower spring-summer streamflows and increased spring-summer salinities in the estuary. The present work shows that these hydrologic changes exhibit a strong dependence on elevation, with the greatest loss of snowpack volume in the 1300-2700 m elevation range. Exploiting hydrologic and estuarine modeling capabilities to trace water as it moves through the system reveals that the shift of water in mid-elevations of the Sacramento river basin from snowmelt to rainfall runoff is the dominant cause of projected changes in estuarine inflows and salinity. Additionally, although spring-summer losses of estuarine inflows are balanced by winter gains, the losses have a stronger influence on salinity since longer spring-summer residence times allow the inflow changes to accumulate in the estuary. The changes in inflows sourced in the Sacramento River basin in approximately the 1300-2200 m elevation range thereby lead to a net increase in estuarine salinity under the projected warming. Such changes would impact ecosystems throughout the watershed and threaten to contaminate much of California's freshwater supply.",,"Climate change; Ecosystems; Precipitation (chemical); Snow; Watersheds; Weather forecasting; Global climate change; Hydrologic changes; Hydrology; climate change; elevation; estuary; hydrological change; salinity; snowmelt; streamflow; California; North America; San Francisco; United States",,,,,,"(1998) California Water Plan, pp. 160-198. , Bulletin; (1999) DAYFLOW Data, , http://iep.water.ca.gov/dayflow/; Dai, A., Wigley, T.M.L., Boville, B.A., Kiehl, J.T., Buja, L.E., Climates of the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries Simulated by the NCAR Climate System Model (2001) J.
