The geographical distribution of Atlantic cod with the different haemoglobin types varies, with the HbI2 allele occurring at high frequency in northern regions, and the HbI1 allele dominant in warmer areas. To determine if temperature is a selective parameter in the distribution of the haemoglobin types, the preferred temperature of the homozygous genotypes HbI-1 and HbI-2 was measured. We found that HbI-2 cod preferred a temperature of 8.2±1.5°C while HbI-1 cod preferred 15.4±1.1°C, and this preference was significant. The effect of hypoxia (35% oxygen saturation) on the preferred temperature was also measured. Previous studies showed that the preferred temperature of fish decreases during hypoxia, and this was the case for HbI-1 cod, which preferred 9.8±1.8°C during hypoxia, whereas HbI-2 cod did not show this effect. The results indicate that environmental temperature changes will lead to a distributional change in the different haemoglobin types of Atlantic cod, global warming providing an advantage for HbI-1 cod. However, since HbI-1 cod prefer a low temperature under hypoxic conditions, a combination of increased water temperature and hypoxia could be unfavourable for Atlantic cod stocks.","Atlantic cod; Gadus morhua; Haemoglobin; Hypoxia; Preferred temperature; Swimming speed","hemoglobin; oxygen; sea water; acclimatization; allele; animal; anoxia; article; Atlantic Ocean; climate; fish; gene frequency; genetics; genotype; pathophysiology; physiology; temperature; Acclimatization; Alleles; Animals; Anoxia; Atlantic Ocean; Climate; Fishes; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Hemoglobins; Oxygen; Seawater; Temperature; Animalia; Gadus; Gadus morhua",,"hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Hemoglobins; Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Bejda, A.J., Studholme, A.L., Olla, B.L., Behavioral responses of red hake, Urophycis chuss, to decreasing concentrations of dissolved oxygen (1987) Env.
