We report on GHG emissions from common Kenyan wood and charcoal cookstoves. Our estimations are based on 29 d of measurements under the conditions of actual use in 19 rural Kenyan households. Carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, combustion phase, and fuel mass were measured continuously or in short intervals in day-long monitoring sessions. Emissions of pollutants other than CO and PM10 were estimated using emissions ratios from published literature. We estimated that the daily carbon emissions from charcoal stoves (5202 ± 2257 g of C: mean ± SD) were lower than both traditional open fire (5990 ± 1843 g of C) and improved ceramic woodstoves (5905 ± 1553 g of C), but the differences were not statistically significant. However, when each pollutantwas weighted using a 20-yr global warming potential, charcoal stoves emitted larger amounts of GHGs than either type of woodstove (9850 ± 4600 g of C for charcoal as compared to 8310 ± 2400 and 9649 ± 2207 for open fire and ceramic woodstoves, respectively; differences not statistically significant). Non-CO2 emissions from charcoal stoves were 5549 ± 2700 g of C in 20-yr CO2 equivalent units, while emissions were 2860 ± 680 and 4711 ± 919 for three-stone fires and improved ceramic stoves, respectively, with statistically significant results between charcoal and wood stoves. Therefore in a sustainable fuel-cycle (i.e., excluding CO2), charcoal stoves have larger emissions than woodstoves. When the emissions from charcoal production, measured in a previous study, were included in the assessment, the disparity between the GHG emissions from charcoal and firewood increased significantly, with non-CO2 GHG emissions factors (g of C/kg of fuel burned) for charcoal production and consumption 6-13 times higher than emissions from woodstoves. Policy implications and options for environment and public health are discussed.",,"Air pollution; Charcoal; Combustion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Health hazards; Public policy; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Environmental engineering; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; charcoal; atmospheric pollution; cooking appliance; emission inventory; energy use; greenhouse gas; rural population; air pollution; article; ceramics; energy resource; environmental impact; exhaust gas; fire; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; health care policy; household; Kenya; particulate matter; public health; rural area; technology; wood; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Coal; Cookery; Developing Countries; Energy-Generating Resources; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Household Articles; Kenya; Wood; Kenya",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; carbon, 7440-44-0; charcoal, 16291-96-6; Air Pollutants; Carbon Monoxide, 630-08-0; Coal; Gases",,,,"(1997) Energy After Rio: Prospects and Challenges, , United Nations Publications: New York; (1999) A Guide to the Global Environment, , World Resources Institute with UNEP/UNDP and World Bank, Eds.; Oxford University Press: New York; Smith, K.R., (1987) Biofuels, Air Pollution, and Health: A Global Review, , Plenum Press: New York; Bruce, N., Perez-Pedilla, R., Albalak, R., (2000) Bull.
