In this study, high-resolution paleo-climatic data have been used to explore at a macroscale the effects of climate change on the outbreak of war and population decline in the preindustrial era. We show that long-term fluctuations of war frequency and population changes followed the cycles of temperature change. Further analyses show that cooling impeded agricultural production, which brought about a series of serious social problems, including price inflation, then successively war outbreak, famine, and population decline successively. The findings suggest that worldwide and synchronistic war-peace, population, and price cycles in recent centuries have been driven mainly by long-term climate change. The findings also imply that social mechanisms that might mitigate the impact of climate change were not significantly effective during the study period. Climate change may thus have played a more important role and imposed a wider ranging effect on human civilization than has so far been suggested. Findings of this research may lend an additional dimension to the classic concepts of Malthusianism and Darwinism. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Agricultural production; Population collapse; Preindustrial era; Price; War-peace cycles","article; climate change; human; population growth; population research; priority journal; scientist; temperature; war; Climate; Greenhouse Effect; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Population Density; Temperature; War",,,,,,"(1998) Decade-to-Century-Scale Climate Variability and Change: A Science Strategy, , National Research Council , Natl Acad Press, Washington, DC; Polyak, V.J., Asmerom, Y., (2001) Science, 294, pp. 148-151; Weiss, H., Bradley, R.S., (2001) Science, 291, pp. 609-610; Wu, W., Liu, T., (2001) Q Sci, 21, pp. 443-451; Webster, D., (1975) Am Antiquity, 40, pp. 464-470; Cowie, J., (1998) Climate and Human Change: Disaster or Opportunity, , Parthenon, New York; Ferguson, R.B., (1984) Warfare, Culture, and Environment, , Academic, Orlando, FL; Homer-Dixon, T.F., (1994) Int Security, 19, pp. 5-40; Suhrke, A., (1997) Conflict and the Environment, pp. 255-272. , ed Gleditsch NP Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, pp; Galloway, P.R., (1986) Population Dev Rev, 12, pp. 1-24; Lee, H.F., Fok, L., Zhang, D.D., (2007) Clim Change, , in press; Zhang, D.D., Jim, C.Y., Lin, G.C.S., He, Y.Q., Wang, J.J., Lee, H.F., (2006) Clim Change, 76, pp. 459-477; Zhang, D.D., Zhang, J., Lee, H.F., He, Y.Q., (2007) Hum Ecol, 35, pp. 403-414; Lamb, H.H., (1995) Climate, History, and the Modern World, , Routledge, London; Stranks, R.T., (1997) Conflict and the Environment, pp. 157-175. , ed Gleditsch NP Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, pp; Westing, A.H., (1988) Cultural Norms, War, and the Environment, , Oxford Univ Press, Oxford; Mann, M.E., Jones, P.D., (2003) Geophys Res Lett, 30, p. 1820; Slicher van Bath, B.H., (1967) Acta Historiae Neerlandica, 2, pp. 26-106; Krus, D.J., Nelsen, E.A., Webb, J.M., (1998) Psychol Rep, 83, pp. 138-143; Johnson DL, Gould L (1984) in Climate and Development, ed Biswas AK (Tycooly, Dublin), pp 117-138Osborn, T., Briffa, K.R., (2006) Science, 311, pp. 841-844; Jiang, T., (1993) Recent History of Chinese Population, , Hangzhou Univ Press, Hangzhou, China; Fischer, D.H., (1996) The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History, , Oxford Univ Press, New York; McEvedy, C., Jones, R., (1978) Atlas of World Population History, , Allen Lane, London; Gong, S., (2003) Acta Geogr Sinica, 58, pp. 870-878; Beaud, M., (1984) A History of Capitalism, 1500-1980, , Macmillan, London; Koepke, N., Baten, J., (2005) Eur Rev Econ History, 9, pp. 61-95; Deway, E.R., Franden, D.E., (1947) Cycles: The Science of Prediction, , Holt, New York; Goldstone, J.A., (1991) Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World, , Univ California Press, Berkeley; Boserup, E., (1965) The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure, , Allen & Unwin, London; Howard, M.E., (1983) The Causes of Wars and Other Essays, , Temple Smith, London; Van Evera, S., (1999) Causes of War: Power and the Roots of Conflict, , Cornell Univ Press, Ithaca, NY; Maslow, A.H., (1970) Motivation and Personality, , Harper & Row, New York; Furuya, J., Koyama, O., (2005) Japan Agric Res Q, 39, pp. 121-134; Lobell, D.B., Field, C.B., (2007) Environ Res Lett, 2, p. 014002; Esper, J., Cook, E.R., Schweingruber, F.H., (2002) Science, 295, pp. 2250-2253; Hughes, M.K., Diaz, H.F., (1994) Clim Change, 26, pp. 109-142; Luard, E., (1986) War in International Society: A Study in International Sociology, , Tauris, London; Wright, Q., (1942) Study of War, , Univ Chicago Press, Chicago; (1985) Tabulation of Wars in Ancient China, , Editorial Committee of Chinese Military History , People's Liberation Army Press, Beijing; Beveridge, W.H., (1921) Econ J, 31, pp. 429-452; Peng, X., (1965) History of Chinese Currency, , Shanghai People's Press, Shanghai","Zhang, D.D.; Department of Geography, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; email: zhangd@hkucc.hku.hk",,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,18048343,"English","Proc.
