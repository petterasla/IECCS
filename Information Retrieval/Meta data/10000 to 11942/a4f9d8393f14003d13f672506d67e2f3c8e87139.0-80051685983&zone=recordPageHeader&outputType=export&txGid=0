The results showed that total methane emission from rice paddy under the controlled irrigation was reduced by more than 80% and total nitrous oxide emission increased by 15.9% compared with flooding irrigation. Seasonal comprehensive global warming potentials (GWP) of methane and nitrous oxide were 62.23 gCO 2 m -2 for rice paddy under the controlled irrigation, reduced by 68.0% compared with flooding irrigation. Due to large reduction in seepage and surface drainages, nitrogen and phosphorous losses through leaching were reduced by 40.1% and 54.8%, nitrogen and phosphorous losses through surface drainage were reduced by 53.9% and 51.6% from rice paddy under efficient irrigation and drainage compared with traditional irrigation and drainage. Nitrogen loss through ammonia volatilization was reduced by 14.0%. Efficient irrigation and drainage management is helpful to mitigate greenhouse gases emission, nitrogen and phosphorus losses and their pollution on groundwater and surface water. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Ammonia volatilization; Efficient irrigation and drainage; Greenhouse gas; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Paddy field","Ammonia volatilization; Efficient irrigation and drainage; Experimental data; Field experiment; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases emissions; Methane emissions; Nitrogen loss; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Paddy field; Phosphorus loss; Rice paddy; Surface drainage; Traditional irrigation; Agricultural runoff; Ammonia; Anesthetics; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Irrigation; Leaching; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Phosphorus; Nitrogen",,,,,,"Kang, S.Z., Cai, H.J., Feng, S.Y., New ideas and development tendency of theory for water saving in modern agriculture and ecology (in Chinese) (2004) Trans CSAE, 20 (1), pp. 1-4; Mao, Z., Environment impact of water-saving irrigation for rice (1996) Smith M.
