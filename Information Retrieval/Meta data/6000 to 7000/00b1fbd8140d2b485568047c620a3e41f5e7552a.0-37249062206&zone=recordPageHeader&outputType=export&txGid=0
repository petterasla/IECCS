Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas associated with global climate change. At the present time, coal is responsible for 30-40% of world CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. There was a higher correlation between the amount of carbon dioxide emission and percentage of carbon in the fuel for all equations. The squares of correlation coefficients were 0.9999, 0.9978, and 0.9995. The gas sensing characteristics of MgO and CaO as the CO2 gas sensors and CO2 emission capacities selected carbonaceous fuels have been investigated. It was found that increasing the percentage of carbon in carbonaceous fuel caused CO2 emission increase. Carbonation is a stabilization of CO2 by solidification process. The availability of a CO2 fixation technology would serve as insurance in case global warming causes severe restrictions on CO2 emissions. In order to prevent rapid climate change, it will be necessary to stabilize CO2 as carbonate by the carbonation process. The carbonation was carried out using MgO and CaO as CO2 sensors. The yield of carbonation increased with increasing temperature. The rate of carbonation conversion sharply increased in the initial 20 min and then reduced and reached a plateau value after about 40 min. The carbonation conversion with MgO is higher than that of CaO.","Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Gas sensor; Greenhouse emission","Carbonation; Chemical sensors; Correlation methods; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Specific heat; Carbonation sensors; Correlation coefficients; Greenhouse emission; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Bain, R.L., Overend, R.P., Craig, K.R., Biomass-fired power generation (1998) Fuel Process.
