Detailed evidence is included to support the claim that the performance of these new products and their life expectancy is equal to that of their CFC based counterparts. It shows that because of the great diversity of products and applications, that currently five different blowing agents are used since whilst many ozone benign blowing agents exist, none matches the other unique features of the CFCs R11 and R12 entirely. Nevertheless it is demonstrated that the products now in use in the UK, by comparison with their CFC counterparts, are playing a significant part in eliminating the threat to the ozone layer, whilst at the same time being able to continue to make their significant contribution to the reduction of CO2 emissions, believed to be the main cause of global warming.",,"Blowing agents; Carbon dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Global warming; Ozone; Performance; Polyurethanes; Service life; Rigid polyurethane foam products; Rigid foamed plastics",,,,,,,"Ball, G.W.; British Rigid Urethane Foam, Manufacturers Assoc Ltd, Manchester, United Kingdom",,,"Rapra Technology Ltd, Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",,,,,02667320,,PRPTE,,"English","Progr Rubber Plast Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028756405
