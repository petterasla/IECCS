This system is currently undergoing an unprecedented crisis due to freshwater deprivation. A reversed salinity gradient has persisted with hypersaline conditions (&gt;300) occurring in the upper regions of the estuarine lake. In the context of climate change, rising temperatures will not only push the thermal tolerance limits of estuarine organisms, but increased evaporation from this lake's large surface area will lead to further salinity increases. The present study aims to determine the temperature and salinity tolerance of M. africana, both through in situ studies and the use of laboratory experiments. Results indicate that M. africana is a broad euryhaline species. Mysids were recorded at salinity levels ranging from 2.55 to 64.5 in situ. While experiments revealed a narrower salinity tolerance, acclimation resulted in a significant increase in the tolerance range of this species. It is probable, however, that slower acclimation times may increase survival rates even further, particularly in the higher salinity treatments. M. africana was especially tolerant of the lower salinity levels. In the 20°C acclimation experiment, LS50 at 1 and 2.5 was only reached after 8 and &gt;168h, respectively. Survival at 10 and 40°C was negligible at all salinity levels. This concurs with field results which documented mysids at temperatures ranging from 16.2 to 30.9°C. Salinity and temperature increases associated with global climate change may, therefore, have significant implications for these mysid populations, with cascading effects on the higher trophic levels which they support. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Drought; Hypersalinity; ISimangaliso Wetland Park; Mesopodopsis africana; Temperature","acclimation; climate change; crustacean; disturbance; drought; estuarine ecosystem; evaporation; global climate; hypersaline environment; laboratory method; lake ecosystem; salinity tolerance; survival; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; trophic cascade; trophic level; iSimangaliso Wetland Park; KwaZulu-Natal; Saint Lucia Estuary; South Africa; Mesopodopsis africana; Mysida",,,,,,"Alderdice, D.E., Factor combinations: responses of marine poikilotherms to environmental factors acting in concert (1972) Environmental Factors, 1, pp. 1659-1722. , Wiley Interscience, London, England, Pt. 3, O.
