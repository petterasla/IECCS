Topics such as the influence of the annual cycle, global warming, stochastic influences due to weather conditions and off-equatorial heat-sinks are discussed using only modest analytical and numerical resources. The delayed-action oscillator allows for a pedagogical introduction to the science of El Niño and La Niña and avoids the need for large-scale computing resources normally associated with much more sophisticated coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. © 2007 American Association of Physics Teachers.",,,,,,,,"Blackwood, O., A weather observation exercise for the general physics laboratory (1943) Am.
