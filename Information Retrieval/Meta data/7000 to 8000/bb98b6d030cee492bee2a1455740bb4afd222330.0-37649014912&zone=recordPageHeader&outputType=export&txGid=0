In Australia, enteric emissions from the livestock sector contribute 10% of Australia's greenhouse gases. The northern Australian beef industry about 16 million animals is a major contributor to these emissions. However, relative to temperate systems, comparatively little research has been conducted on enteric methane emissions from tropical feeding systems. This paper describes a modelling approach that estimates cattle methane emissions for various bioregions of northern Australia. The approach incorporates a metabolisable energy based model of animal production linked to a property herd economic model. This provides a flexible tool to evaluate animal and property herd dynamics on regional methane yields and liveweight productivity, as well as to assess financial impacts. The model predicts that an important determinant of methane output per unit of product is reduced days to market. Reduced days to market may be achieved through a range of energy supplementation and marketing strategies. © CSIRO 2008.",,"agricultural market; emission; greenhouse gas; livestock farming; methane; modeling; Australasia; Australia; Animalia; Bos",,,,,,"(2006) Australian beef 06.1, , ABARE , Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics: Canberra; Alford, A.R., Hegarty, R.S., Parnell, P.F., Cacho, O.J., Herd, R.M., Griffith, G.R., The impact of breeding to reduce residual feed intake on enteric methane emissions from the Australian beef industry (2006) Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture, 46, pp. 813-820. , doi: 10.1071/EA05300; The nutrient requirements of ruminant livestock (1980) Australian Research Council, , ARC , CAB International: Wallingford UK; (2007) National greenhouse gas inventory 2005, , Australian Greenhouse Office , Commonwealth of Australia: Canberra; Benchaar, C., Pomar, C., Chiquette, J., Evaluation of dietary strategies to reduce methane production in ruminants: A modelling approach (2001) Canadian Journal of Animal Science, 81, pp. 563-574; Coleman SW (2005) Predicting forage intake by grazing ruminants.
