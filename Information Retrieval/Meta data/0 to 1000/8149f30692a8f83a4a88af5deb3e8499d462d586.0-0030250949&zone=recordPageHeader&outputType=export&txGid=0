Initially, as methane production represents a significant loss of gross energy in the feed (2-15%), the ultimate goal of such intervention in rumen fermentation was an increase in feed efficiency. A second reason favouring research on methane inhibition is its role in the global warming phenomenon and in the destruction of the ozone layer. In this review, the authors describe briefly several interventions for reducing methane emission by ruminants. The objective can be reached by intervention at the dietary level by ration manipulation (composition, feeding level) or by the use of additives or supplements. Examples of additives are polyhalogenated compounds, ionophores and other antibiotics. Supplementation of the ration with lipids also lowered methanogenesis. More biotechnological interventions, e.g., defaunation, probiotics and introduction of reductive acetogenesis in the rumen, are also mentioned. It can be concluded that drastic inhibition of methane production is not unequivocally successful as a result of several factors, such as: instantaneous inhibition often followed by restoration of methanogenesis due to adaptation of the microbes or degradation of the additive, toxicity for the host animal, negative effects on overall digestion and productive performance. Therefore, methanogenesis and its inhibition cannot be considered as a separate part of rumen fermentation and its consequences on the animal should be taken into account.",,"Defaunation; Gross energy; Inhibition; Probiotics; Ration; Rumen methanogenesis; Ruminants; Biotechnology; Control; Fermentation; Global warming; Methane; Methanogens; Ozone layer; Particulate emissions; Performance; Environmental engineering; antibiotic agent; ionophore; lipid; methane; diet; diet supplementation; fat intake; greenhouse effect; metabolic inhibition; methanobacterium; methanogenesis; nonhuman; ozone layer; review; ruminant stomach; Animalia; Methanobacterium",,"lipid, 66455-18-3; methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Aimone, J.C., Wagner, D.G., Micronized Wheat I.
