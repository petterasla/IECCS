The comparison is based on a full scale case study in southern Sweden and used input-data related to aspects such as source-separation behaviour, transport distances, etc. are site-specific. Results show that biological treatment methods - both anaerobic and aerobic, result in net avoidance of GHG-emissions, but give a larger contribution both to nutrient enrichment and acidification when compared to incineration. Results are to a high degree dependent on energy substitution and emissions during biological processes. It was seen that if it is assumed that produced biogas substitute electricity based on Danish coal power, this is preferable before use of biogas as car fuel. Use of biogas for Danish electricity substitution was also determined to be more beneficial compared to incineration of organic household waste. This is a result mainly of the use of plastic bags in the incineration alternative (compared to paper bags in the anaerobic) and the use of biofertiliser (digestate) from anaerobic treatment as substitution of chemical fertilisers used in an incineration alternative. Net impact related to GWP from the management chain varies from a contribution of 2.6kg CO 2-eq/household and year if incineration is utilised, to an avoidance of 5.6kg CO 2-eq/household and year if choosing anaerobic digestion and using produced biogas as car fuel. Impacts are often dependent on processes allocated far from the control of local decision-makers, indicating the importance of a holistic approach and extended collaboration between agents in the waste management chain. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Anaerobic treatments; Biological process; Biological treatment methods; Coal power; Collaboration between agents; Decentralised; Decision makers; Digestate; Full scale; Holistic approach; Household food; Life cycle approach; Net impact; Nutrient enrichments; Organic household wastes; Plastic bags; Site-specific; Transport distances; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Paper containers; Plastic containers; Waste management; Waste incineration; biofertilizer; biogas; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; fuel; plastic; unclassified drug; acidification; biofertilizer; biogas; carbon dioxide; composting; digestion; environmental impact; food; greenhouse gas; incineration; life cycle analysis; nutrient enrichment; waste management; acidification; anaerobic digestion; article; comparative study; composting; controlled study; Denmark; domestic waste; electricity; energy resource; environmental impact; food; gas; incineration; life cycle; nutrient; organic waste; paper; priority journal; Sweden; traffic and transport; waste management; Aerobiosis; Anaerobiosis; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofuels; Carbon Footprint; Energy-Generating Resources; Garbage; Incineration; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Sweden; Transportation; Sweden",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Biofuels; Soil",,,,"Amlinger, F., Peyr, S., (2003), http://www.biowaste.at/fileadmin/download/tpq_Klimarelevanz-Mietenkompostierung_de.pdf, Environmental impacts of decentralized windrow composting-Greenhouse gas emissions, liquid emissions, mass balance, hygienisation potential.
