These images are demonstrated for the first time. The satellite land image for 2005 is considered to be the most significant one. This is considered to be the highest level of degradation since 1953. The water degradation in the lake was fitted by linear regression and the best fitting for the calculated surface area for the water can be presented by a polynomial equation. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Al-Azraq Oasis; arid zones; environmental hydrology; geographic information system; GIS; global warming; Jordan; remote sensing; RS; water resources management",,,,,,,"Abu-Jaber, N.S., Jawad, A.A., Al-Qudah, K., Use of solute and isotopic composition of groundwater to constrain the groundwater flow system of the Azraq area Jordan (1998) Ground Water, 36, pp. 361-365; Al-Adamat, R., Foster, I., Baban, S., Groundwater vulnerability and risk mapping for the Basaltic aquifer of the Azraq basin of Jordan using GIS, Remote sensing and DRASTIC (2003) Applied Geography, 23, pp. 303-324; Al-Kharabsheh, A., Ground-water modelling and long-term management of the Azraq Basin as an example of arid area conditions (Jordan) (2000) Journal of Arid Environments, 44, pp. 143-153; Bajjali, W., Al-Hadidi, K., Hydrochemical evaluation of groundwater in Azraq Basin, Jordan using environmental isotopes and GIS techniques (2005) Twenty-Fifth Annual ESRI International User Conference, pp. 1-19. , 25–29 July, San Diego, California; Barber, W., Carr, D.P., Raikes, Partners, (1973) Digital Model of Shallow Aquifer Complex of the Azraq Basin East Jordan, , Consultant’s Report, Development and Use of the Groundwater Resources of Eastern Jordan, FAO/SEJOR/71/525; Dahamsheh, A., Aksoy, H., Artificial neural network models for forecasting intermittent monthly precipitation in arid regions (2009) Meteorol.
