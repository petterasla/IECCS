The number of Santa Ana days per winter season is approximately 20% fewer in the mid 21st century compared to the late 20th century. Since the only systematic and sustained difference between these two periods is the level of anthropogenic forcing, this effect is anthropogenic in origin. In both time periods, Santa Ana winds are partly katabatically-driven by a temperature difference between the cold wintertime air pooling in the desert against coastal mountains and the adjacent warm air over the ocean. However, this katabatic mechanism is significantly weaker during the mid 21st century time period. This occurs because of the well-documented differential warming associated with transient climate change, with more warming in the desert interior than over the ocean. Thus the mechanism responsible for the decrease in Santa Ana frequency originates from a well-known aspect of the climate response to increasing greenhouse gases, but cannot be understood or simulated without mesoscale atmospheric dynamics. In addition to the change in Santa Ana frequency, we investigate changes during Santa Anas in two other meteorological variables known to be relevant to fire weather conditions-relative humidity and temperature. We find a decrease in the relative humidity and an increase in temperature. Both these changes would favor fire. A fire behavior model accounting for changes in wind, temperature, and relative humidity simultaneously is necessary to draw firm conclusions about future fire risk and growth associated with Santa Ana events. While our results are somewhat limited by a relatively small sample size, they illustrate an observed and explainable regional change in climate due to plausible mesoscale processes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","climate change; downslope winds; fire weather; regional climate","20th century; Anthropogenic forcing; Atmospheric dynamics; Down-scaling; Downslope; Fire behavior; Fire risks; fire weather; Global climate changes; Mesoscale; Mesoscale process; Meteorological variables; National center for atmospheric researches; Regional climate; Small Sample Size; Southern California; Temperature and relative humidity; Temperature differences; Time-periods; Transient climate change; Warm air; Wind events; Winter seasons; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Fires; Greenhouse gases; Landforms; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; climate change; greenhouse gas; katabatic flow; regional climate; relative humidity; temperature effect; twentieth century; twenty first century; California; Santa Ana [California]; United States; Anas",,,,,,"Castro, R., Mascarenhas, A., Martinez-Diaz-de Leon, A., Durazo, R., Gil-Silva, E., Spatial influence and oceanic thermal response to Santa Ana events along the Baja California peninsula (2006) Atmosfera, 19 (3), pp. 195-211; Chang, S., Hahn, D., Yang, C., Norquist, D., Ek, M., Validation study of the CAPS model and land surface scheme using the 1987 Cabauw/PILPS dataset (1999) J Appl Meteorol, 38, pp. 405-422; Christensen, J.H., Hewitson, B., Busuioc, A., Chen, A., Gao, X., Held, I., Jones, R., Whetton, P., Regional climate projections (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
