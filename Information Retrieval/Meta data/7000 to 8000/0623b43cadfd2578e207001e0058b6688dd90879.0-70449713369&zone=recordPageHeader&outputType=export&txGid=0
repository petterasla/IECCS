With the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events predicted to change in the future, informed policy design and analysis requires an understanding of which countries and groups are going to be most vulnerable to increasing poverty. Using a novel economic-climate analysis framework, we assess the poverty impacts of climate volatility for seven socio-economic groups in 16 developing countries. We find that extremes under present climate volatility increase poverty across our developing country sample - particularly in Bangladesh, Mexico, Indonesia, and Africa - with urban wage earners the most vulnerable group. We also find that global warming exacerbates poverty vulnerability in many nations. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Climate extremes; Food prices; Poverty vulnerability; Volatility","Global warming; Agricultural productivity; Analysis frameworks; Climate extremes; Extreme climates; Food prices; Poverty vulnerability; Volatility; Vulnerable groups; Developing countries",,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Social vulnerability to climate change and extremes in coastal Vietnam (1999) World Dev., 27 (2), pp. 249-269; Battisti, D.S., Naylor, R.L., Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat (2009) Science, 323 (5911), pp. 240-244; Bryan, E., Deressa, T.T., Gbetibouo, G.A., Ringler, C., Adaptation to climate change in Ethiopia and South Africa (2009) Environ.
