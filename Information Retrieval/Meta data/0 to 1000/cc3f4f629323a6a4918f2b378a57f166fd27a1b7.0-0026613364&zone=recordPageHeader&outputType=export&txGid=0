At the same time, tropical sea surface temperatures are interpreted to have been the same as or slightly cooler than present values6. The question of how to warm polar regions of Earth without noticeably warming the tropics remains unresolved; increased amounts of greenhouse gases would be expected to warm all latitudes equally7. Oceanic heat transport has been postulated as a mechanism for heating high latitudes8-10, but it is difficult to explain the dynamics that would achieve this7,11. Here we consider estimates of Eocene wetland areas and suggest that the flux of methane, an important greenhouse gas, may have been substantially greater during the Eocene than at present. Elevated methane concentrations would have enhanced early Eocene global warming, and also might specifically have prevented severe winter cooling of polar regions because of the potential of atmospheric methane to promote the formation of optically thick, polar stratospheric ice clouds12-14.",,"Mammalia; Reptilia; atmospheric methane; Eocene; global warming; methane; polar warming; wetland; methane; article; astronomy; atmosphere; climate; cold climate; evolution; geology; greenhouse effect; NASA Discipline Exobiology; NASA Discipline Number 52-30; NASA Program Exobiology; Non-NASA Center; paleontology; sea; temperature; NASA Discipline Exobiology; NASA Discipline Number 52-30; NASA Program Exobiology; Non-NASA Center; Atmosphere; Climate; Cold Climate; Earth (Planet); Evolution; Geology; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Oceans and Seas; Paleontology; Temperature",,"methane, 74-82-8; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,,"Sloan, L.C.; Department of Geological Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1063, United States",,,,,,,,00280836,,NATUA,11536496,"English","Nature",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026613364
