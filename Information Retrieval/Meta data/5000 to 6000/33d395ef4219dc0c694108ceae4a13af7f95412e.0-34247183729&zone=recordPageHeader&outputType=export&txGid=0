Age and growth variables were determined by examining 540 sagittal otoliths from specimens ranging between 19 and 146 mm total length. Growth of young bullhead (0+ and 1+ years) was higher in the warmest sites, especially in relation to water temperature during the growing season (spring and summer). Growth of older bullhead (2+ to 5+ years) was negatively related to mean water temperature of the site. The growth performance of bullhead over its whole life cycle was negatively correlated with water temperature, which could be partly explained by a higher energy allocation to reproduction in the warmest sites. Life span was longer in the colder sites (7 years) than in the warmer ones (4 or 5 years), and bullhead matured earlier in the warmer sites (age 1+ or 2+ years) compared to the colder ones (age 2+ or 3+ years). These results, combined with previous data on reproductive traits, suggest the possible effects that global warming could have on bullhead population dynamics. © 2007 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Alternative strategies; Global warming; Life-history traits; Local adaptations; Phenotypic plasticity; Population structure","Cottus gobio",,,,,,"Abdoli, A., Pont, D., Sagnes, P., Influence of female age, body size and environmental conditions on annual egg production of the bullhead Cottus gobio (Bez drainage, France) (2005) Journal of Fish Biology, 67, pp. 1327-1341. , doi: 10.1111/j.1095-8649.2005.00829.x; Alm, G., Connections between maturity, size and age in fishes.
