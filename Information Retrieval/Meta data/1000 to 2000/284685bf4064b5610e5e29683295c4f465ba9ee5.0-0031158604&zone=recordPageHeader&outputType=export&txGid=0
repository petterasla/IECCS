GCM predictions of precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude. The water balance is critical to every aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table which limits the water storage capabilites of the subsurface. Thawing associated with climate change would, particulalry in areas of massive ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the environment. the normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta lakes. A lengthening of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have deleterious effets on the food chain. Extensive wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence that this may be occurring already.",,"Freshwaters; General circulation models (GCM); Limnology; Drying; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Global warming; Hydrology; Ice; Lakes; Permafrost; Rain; Rivers; Snow; Thermal effects; Surface waters; cabon dioxide doubling; caron budget; climate change; climatic change; freshwater ecosystem; hydrological response; hydrology; limnology; Arctic; North America",,,,,,,"Rouse, W.R.; Dept of Geography, McMaster Univ, Hamilton Ont L8S 1V2, Canada",,,,,,,,08856087,,HYPRE,,"English","Hydrol Processes",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031158604
