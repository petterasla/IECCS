N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured from field soils planted with crops and CO2 fluxes were measured from bare soils in attached plots at each site using the closed chamber method. Cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.02 g N m-2 to 0.62 g N m-2 for different soil types, which accounted for 0.35-4.44% of the applied fertilizer nitrogen. Cumulative CH 4 uptake rates ranged from -0.08 g C m-2 to 0 g C m -2. Soil carbon sequestration, defined as the difference between the net primary production and carbon loss through harvest and soil microbial decomposition, ranged from -410 to -193 g C m-2, indicating that the carbon loss from soils could not be compensated by the carbon input through plant photosynthesis. The net GWP from the investigated cropping systems ranged from 749 to 1790 g CO2 equivalents m-2. CO2 emission contributed to 84-99% of the net GWP and N2O contributed 1-16%. © 2006 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Carbon sequestration; Global warming potential; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Upland cropping system",,,,,,,"Ehhalt, D., Prather, M., Dentener, F., Atmospheric chemistry and greenhouse gases (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis., pp. 238-288. , In.
