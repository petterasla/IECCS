In this work, we present two non-parametric χ2 tests based on the U-test for the isotonic change-point problem proposed in an unpublished work by G. Shen and H. Xu (henceforth abbreviated as SX (unpublished)) and apply them to the global warming data. Our tests do not require any structure assumption on the underlying the deterministic mean process {μt} under the periodically isotonic alternative, but accommodate a large class of the models for the random error process. Being more attractive, the two tests obviate estimation of {μt} and possess explicit asymptotic distributions for short-range dependence data, and have asymptotic power 1 even under the local alternative. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Change-point; Climatic; Isotonic; Nonparametric; Periodical",,,,,,,"Doukhan, P., (1985) Mixing Properties and Examples, , Springer-Verlag; Follmann, D., A simple multivariate test for one-sided alternatives (1996) JASA, 91 (434), pp. 854-861; Holmgren, K., Karlen, W., Lauritzen, S.E., Lee-Thorp, J.A., Partridge, T.C., Piketh, S., Repinski, P., Tyson, P.D., A 3000-year high-resolution stalagmite based record of paleoclimate for northeastern South Africa (1999) The Holocene, 9, pp. 295-309; Holmgren, K., Tyson, P.D., Moberg, A., Svanered, O., A preliminary 3000-year regional temperature reconstruction for South Africa (2001) South African Journal of Science, 99, pp. 49-51; Jones, P.D., Mann, M.E., Climate over past millennia (2004) Reviews of Geophysics, 42 (2), pp. 1-42; Lassen, K., Friis-Christensen, E., Variability of the solar cycle length during the past five centuries and the apparent association with terrestrial climate (1995) Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 57 (8), pp. 835-845; Laut, P., Solar activity and terrestrial climate: an analysis of some purported correlations (2003) Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 65, pp. 801-812; Loehle, C., Climate change: detection and attribution of trends from long-term geologic data (2004) Ecological Modelling, 171, pp. 433-450; Mann, M.E., Jones, P.D., Global surface temperatures over the past two millennia (2003) Geophysical Research Letters, 30 (15), p. 1820; Shen, G., Xu, H., Another look at the isotonic change-point problem (unpublished)Wu, W.B., Woodroofe, M., Mentz, G., Isotonic regression: another look at the change-point problem (2001) Biometrika, 88 (3), pp. 793-804","Shen, G.; Department of Statistics, North Dakota State UniversityUnited States; email: gang.shen@ndsu.edu",,,,,,,,01677152,,SPLTD,,"English","Stat.
