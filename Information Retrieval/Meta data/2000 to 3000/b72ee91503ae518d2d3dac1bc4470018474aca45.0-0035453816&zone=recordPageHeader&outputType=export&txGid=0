Particular attention is focused on the role of the ocean in the climate change. The R/V Keifu Maru is specially equipped with the towed CTD system, which allows making measurements of upper ocean temperature and salinity underway, and the measuring system of carbon dioxide concentrations in the air and the sea surface water.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental protection; Global warming; Monitoring; Surface waters; Research vessels; Oceanography; carbon dioxide; climate change; environmental monitoring; research vessel; salinity; sea surface temperature",,,,,,"Gordon, L.I., Jones, L.B., The effect of temperature on carbon dioxide partial pressure in sea water (1973) Marine Chemistry, 1, pp. 317-322; Hirota, M., Nemoto, K., Murata, A., Fushimi, K., Observation of carbon dioxide concentrations in air and surface sea water in the western North Pacific Ocean (1991) Oceanographical Magazine, 41 (1-2), pp. 19-28; Huyer, A., Korso, P.M., Upper ocean thermohaline fields near 2°S, 156°E, during the tropical ocean-global atmosphere-coupled ocean-atmosphere response experiment, November 1992 to February 1993 (1997) Journal of Geophysical Research, 102 (6 C), pp. 12749-12784; (1996) Climate Chnange 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Cambridge University Press, UK, 572pp; (1997) Report of Observation for Monitoring Background Marine Pollution, 43. , Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), 36pp","Saiki, M.; Japan Meteorological Agency, Tokyo, Japan",,,,,,,,00253324,,,,"English","Mar.
