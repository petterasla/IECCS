A market-based system was developed to distribute carbon emission rights among stakeholders and encourages them to minimize costs by freely trading the permits. The US government is penalizing trade partners who refuse to contain emissions, also to meet treaty obligations to offset the cost advantages of using polluting technology with green tariffs. The industries in Kyoto treaty countries, under the Clean Development Mechanism, aims to earn credit against their own abatement obligations by financing emissions reduction in poor countries. The task of limiting climate change is expected to take longer in both political and economic terms to strengthen national resolve, where the world's largest economy can afford to allow the best of intentions to be lost over the frailty of international cooperation.",,"Carbon emissions; Clean development mechanisms; Cost advantages; Emissions reductions; Kyoto treaties; Market-based systems; Polluting technologies; Trade partners; Us governments; Climatology; Global warming; International cooperation; Emission control",,,,,,,"Hahn, R.; American Enterprise InstituteUnited States; email: rhahn@aei.org",,,,,,,,07485492,,ISTEE,,"English","Issues Sci Technol",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-63549084153
