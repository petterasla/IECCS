Real-world issues justify this approach: the need to provide sustainable production systems that minimize on- and off-site pollution and soil degradation; and the demand for solutions to global warming. The proposed technology is a pyrolysis process that yields gas, bio-oil and biochar. The composition and heating value of the gas makes it suitable for use as a fuel. The bio-oil obtained may be evaluated as an environmentally friendly green biofuel candidate. The biochar product is carbon-rich and a potential solid biofuel. Other ways it might be used as a C and N source in soil amendment. This is a key to securing environmental benefits: the production of a biochar which can be applied to soil. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
