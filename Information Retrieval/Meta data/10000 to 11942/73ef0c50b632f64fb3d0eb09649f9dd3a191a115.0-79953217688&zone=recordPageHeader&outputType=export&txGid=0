Until recently, the significant below-ground CCS capacity of coastal vegetation such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves has largely gone unrecognized in models of global carbon transfer. However, this reservoir of natural, free, and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly jeopardized by alarming trends in coastal habitat loss, totalling 30-50% of global abundance over the last century alone. Human intervention to restore lost habitats is a potentially powerful solution to improve natural rates of global CCS, but data suggest this approach is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current restoration efforts are increased to an industrial scale. Failure to do so raises the question of whether resources currently used for expensive and time-consuming restoration projects would be more wisely invested in arresting further habitat loss and encouraging natural recovery. © 2011 Irving et al.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon; sea water; article; carbon cycling; carbon storage; climate change; coastal waters; ecosystem restoration; habitat; mangrove; nonhuman; salt marsh; seagrass; soil degradation; vegetation; ecosystem; environmental protection; international cooperation; metabolism; methodology; plant; tropic climate; Rhizophoraceae; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Internationality; Plants; Seawater; Tropical Climate",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Hoffert, M.I., Caldeira, K., Benford, G., Criswell, D.R., Green, C., Advanced technology paths to global climate stability: Energy for a greenhouse planet (2002) Science, 298, pp. 981-987; Rogelj, J., Nabel, J., Chen, C., Hare, W., Markmann, K., Copenhagen accord pledges are paltry (2010) Nature, 464, pp. 1126-1128; Wigley, T.M.L., A combined mitigation/geoengineering aproach to climate stabilization (2006) Science, 314, pp. 452-454; Walsh, B., Can geoengineering help slow global warming?
