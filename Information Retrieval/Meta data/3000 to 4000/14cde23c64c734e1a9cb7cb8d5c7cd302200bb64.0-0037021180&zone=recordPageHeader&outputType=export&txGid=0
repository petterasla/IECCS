To understand the implications of climate change on cotton production in the Mississippi Delta, 30 years (1964 to 1993) of cotton growth and yield at Stoneville, Mississippi, USA, were simulated using the cotton simulation model GOSSYM. The GCM projections showed a nearly 4°C rise in average temperature and a decrease in precipitation during the crop growing season. The fertilization effect of an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 360 to 540 ppm, without the change in other climatic variables, increased yields by 10% from 1563 to 1713 kg ha-1, but when all projected climatic changes were included, yields decreased by 9% from 1563 to 1429 kg ha-1. The rate of plant growth and development was higher in the future because of enhanced metabolic rates at higher temperatures combined with increased carbon availability. The effect of climate change on cotton production was more drastic in a hot and dry year. Since most of the days with average temperatures above 32°C will likely occur during the reproductive phase, irrigation will be needed to satisfy the high water demand, and this reduces boll abscission by lowering canopy temperatures. Therefore, if global warming occurs as projected, fiber production in the future environment will be reduced, and breeding heat-cold-tolerant cultivars will be necessary to sustain cotton production in the US mid-South. Cultural practices such as earlier planting may be used to avoid the flowering of cotton in the high temperatures that occur during mid to late summer.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cotton; GCM; Global warming; Simulation modeling; Temperature","climate change; cotton; crop production; general circulation model; United States",,,,,,"Acock, B., Acock, M.C., Modeling approaches for predicting crop ecosystem responses to climate change (1993) International Crop Science I, pp. 41-55. , Buxton DR, Shibles R, Forsberg RA, Blad BL, Asay KH, Paulsen GM, Wilson RF (eds) Crop Science Society of America, Madison, WI; Baker, D.N., Lambert, J.R., McKinion, J.M., (1983) GOSSYM: A Simulator of Cotton Crop Growth and Yield, , South Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station Tech Bull 1089, Clemson; Boone, M.Y., Porter, D.O., McKinion, J.M., Calibration of GOSSYM: Theory and practice (1993) Comput Electron Agric, 9, pp. 193-203; Boone, M.Y.L., Porter, D.O., McKinion, J.M., (1995) RHIZOS 1991: A Simulator of Row Crop Rhizospheres, , USDA, ARS Bulletin 113, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC; Boykin, D.L., Carle, R.R., Ranney, C.D., Shanklin, R., (1995) Weather Data Summary for 1964-1993, , http://msa.ars.usda.gov/stoneville/jwdsrc/wbook/wbook.htm, Stoneville, Mississippi, USA; Fitter, A.H., Hay, R.K.M., (1987) Environmental Physiology of Plants, , 2nd edn.
