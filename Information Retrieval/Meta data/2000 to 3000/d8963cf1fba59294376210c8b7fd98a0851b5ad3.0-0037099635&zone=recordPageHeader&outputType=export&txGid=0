In this paper, the global warming effect (GWE) associated with construction and operation of comparable hydroelectric, wind, solar, coal, and natural gas power plants is estimated for four time periods after construction. The assessment includes greenhouse gas emissions from construction, burning of fuels, flooded biomass decay in the reservoir, loss of net ecosystem production, and land use. The results indicate that a wind farm and a hydroelectric plant in an arid zone (such as the Glen Canyon in the Upper Colorado River Basin) appear to have lower GWE than other power plants. For the Glen Canyon hydroelectric plant, the upgrade 20 yr after the beginning of operation increased power capacity by 39% but resulted in a mere 1% of the CO2 emissions from the initial construction and came with no additional emissions from the reservoir, which accounts for the majority of the GWE.",,"Construction effects; Biomass; Ecosystems; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Hydroelectric power; Industrial emissions; Natural gas; Rivers; Electric power plants; alternative energy; emission control; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power plant; power plant; article; biomass; climate change; electric power plant; electricity; field emission; global change; greenhouse; greenhouse effect; river ecosystem; United States; bioremediation; environmental monitoring; incineration; Biodegradation; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Colorado; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Power Plants; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Biodegradation, Environmental; United States; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Fossil Fuels",,,,"Post, N.M., (2001) ENR, 247, p. 16; Rosta, P., Armistead, T., Ichniowski, T., (2001) ENR, 247, p. 12; (2000) DAMS and Development: A New Framework for Decision-Making, , Earthscan Publications Ltd: London and Sterling, VA; (2000) Carbon Dioxide Emissions from the Generation of Electric Power in the United States: 2000, , U.S. Department of Energy/U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Washington, DC; (1998) Toxics Release Inventory: 1998, , U.S. Government Printing Office: Washington, DC; Curran, M.A., (1996) Life Cycle Analysis, , McGraw-Hill: New York; Green Design Initiative, , http://www.eiolca.net, Carnegie Mellon University: Pittsburgh; Hendrickson, C.T., Horvath, A., Joshi, S., Lave, L.B., (1998) Environ.
