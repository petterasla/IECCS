However, one important problem associated with the running out of fossil fuel is normally overlooked i.e. the cease of chemical raw materials supply for plastics, medicine and other fine chemicals. Among all, biomass is the only hope that would harvest energy from sun with the cogeneration of important raw materials for our future. Also, due to its carbon neutrality, non toxicity, biodegradability and compatibility with the existing infrastructures for oil refinery and transportation system, biofuel has become a promising alternative as liquid transportation fuel.","Alternative sources of energy; Biodiesel; Biomass; Depletion of fossil fuel; Global warning","biodiesel; fatty acid; fatty acid ester; fossil fuel; phosphate; polysaccharide; triacylglycerol; algal growth; carbon dioxide fixation; catalyst; conference paper; dinoflagellate; microalga; molecular weight; nonhuman; purification; rapeseed; solar energy; transesterification; wind",,"phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2",,,,,"Yung, K.F.; Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong; email: bckfyung@polyu.edu.hk",,,,,,,,11298723,,PNRUA,,"English","Prog.
