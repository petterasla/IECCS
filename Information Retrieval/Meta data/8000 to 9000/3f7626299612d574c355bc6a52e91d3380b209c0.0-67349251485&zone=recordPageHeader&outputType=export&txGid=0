These are the people whose entire landscape is typically no higher than one meter above sea level. Extreme environmental changes are nothing new to these communities. Over many generations these atoll cultures have survived major, unpredictable and locally devastating changes that are of the same magnitude as those expected from climate changes. An examination of traditional ecological knowledge of Marshall Islanders at Rongelap atoll serves to illustrate some of the coping strategies that have enabled these people to be resilient in the past and in the current environmental crisis. Interviews revealed that these atoll dwellers actively manage the resources that are most likely to be impacted by climate change. © 2009.","Adaptive management; Climate change; Traditional ecological knowledge; Tropical Pacific atolls","adaptive management; atoll; climate change; nature-society relations; sea level; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean",,,,,,"Hurricane Bebe report (1972) Pacific Islands Monthly, 44, pp. 29-32; Beger, M., Pinca, S., Coral reef biodiversity community-based assessment and conservation planning in the Marshall Islands: Baseline surveys, capacity building and natural protection and management of coral reefs of the atoll of Rongelap and Mili (2003) Final report to National Fisheries and Wildlife Foundation; Berkes, F., (1999) Sacred Ecology: Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Resource Management, , Taylor and Francis, Ann Arbor, MI; Bridges, K.W., McClatchey, W., Complementing PABITRA high-island studies by examining terrestrial plant diversity on atolls (2005) Pacific Science, 59, pp. 261-272; Cox, D.C., The hydrology of Arno Atoll, Marshall Islands (1951) Atoll Research Bulletin, 1, pp. 1-30; Hatheway, W.H., The land vegetation of Arno Atoll, Marshall Islands (1953) Atoll Research Bulletin, 16, pp. 1-68; Holden, B.J., Coastal Processes and the Rotuma Wharf (1992) Fiji SOPAC Technical Report, 146. , Suva, Fiji; Holling, C.S., Resilience and stability of ecological systems (1973) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 4, pp. 1-23; Holling, C.S., (1989) Editor of Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management, , Wiley and Sons, Chichester; Hunt, C., Property rights and environmental management on Pacific atolls (1996) International Journal of Social Economics, 23, pp. 221-234; (2007) 4th Assessment Report: Synthesis Report-Summary for Policy Makers [Online], , http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC; Johannes, R.E., (1981) Words of the Lagoon: Fishing and marine lore in the Palau district of Micronesia, , University of California Press, Berkeley; LaBriola, M., (2006) Iien Ippan Doon (This Time Together): Celebrating survival in an 'atypical Marshallese community, , MA Thesis, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu; Ladefoged, T.N., (1993) Evolutionary process in an Oceanic chiefdom intergroup aggression and political integration in traditional Rotuman society, , PhD Dissertation, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii; Lewis, D., (1975) We, the Navigators: The Ancient Art of Landfinding in the Pacific, , University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu; McClatchey, W., Bridges, K.W., The importance of scale in determination of human population distributions in the Marshall Islands (2007) Recent Trends in Ethnopharmacology and Ethnobotany, , Albuquerque U.P.
