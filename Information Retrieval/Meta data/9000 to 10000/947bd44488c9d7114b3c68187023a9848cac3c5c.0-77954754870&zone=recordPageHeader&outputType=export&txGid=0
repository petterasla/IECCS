This requires the ability to evolve in traits that are correlated with changing climatic variables. We studied between-year seed dormancy, which correlates with environmental variability, and tested for clinal trends in its evolvability along an aridity gradient in Israel. We conducted a germination experiment under five irrigation levels with two dryland winter annuals (Biscutella didyma, Bromus fasciculatus) from four sites along the gradient. Species differed in means and evolvability of dormancy. Biscutella had high dormancy, which significantly increased with aridity but decreased with higher irrigation. In Bromus, dormancy was low, similar among populations, and only marginally affected by irrigation. Evolvability in Biscutella was high and varied among populations, without a clinal trend along the gradient. Conversely, in Bromus, trait evolvability was low and declined with increasing aridity. We argue that changes in evolvability along climatic gradients depend on the relative intensity of stabilizing selection. This may be high in Bromus and not only depends on environmental stress, but also on variability. Our findings point to the importance of measuring evolvability of climate-related traits across different natural and artificial environments and for many coexisting species. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.","Annual plants; Bet-hedging; Climate change; Heritability; Risk spreading","adaptive radiation; aridity; climate change; coexistence; environmental stress; germination; global climate; herb; heritability; irrigation; life history trait; perennial plant; population structure; seed dormancy; species diversity; Israel; Biscutella; Bromus; Bromus fasciculatus",,,,,,"Baskin, J.M., Baskin, C.C., A classification system of seed dormancy (2004) Seed Science Research, 14, pp. 1-16; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Bennington, C.C., McGraw, J.B., Environment-dependence of quantitative genetic parameters in Impatiens pallida (1996) Evolution, 50, pp. 1083-1097; Boaz, M., Plitmann, U., Heyn, C.C., The ecogeographic distribution of breeding systems in the Cruciferae (Brassicaceae) of Israel (1990) Israel Journal of Botany, 39, pp. 31-42; Brown, J.S., Venable, D.L., Evolutionary ecology of seed-bank annuals in temporally varying environments (1986) American Naturalist, 127, pp. 31-47; Charmantier, A., Garant, D., Environmental quality and evolutionary potential: lessons from wild populations (2005) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences, 272, pp. 1415-1425; Charmantier, A., Kruuk, L.E.B., Blondel, J., Lambrechts, M.M., Testing for microevolution in body size in three blue tit populations (2004) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 17, pp. 732-743; Chesson, P.L., Coexistence of competitors in spatially and temporally varying environments: a look at the combined effects of different sorts of variability (1985) Theoretical Population Biology, 28, pp. 263-287; Cohen, D., Optimizing reproduction in a randomly varying environment (1966) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 12, pp. 119-129; Cohen, D., Optimizing reproduction in a randomly varying environment when a correlation may exist between the conditions at the time a choice has to be made and the subsequent outcome (1967) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 16, pp. 1-4; Conner, J.K., Franks, R., Stewart, C., Expression of additive genetic variances and covariances for wild radish floral traits: comparison between field and greenhouse environments (2003) Evolution, 57, pp. 487-495; Donohue, K., Completing the cycle: maternal effects as the missing link in plant life histories (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences, 364, pp. 1059-1074; Ehrman, T., Cocks, P.S., Reproductive patterns in annual legume species on an aridity gradient (1996) Plant Ecology, 122, pp. 47-59; Etterson, J.R., Shaw, R.G., Constraint to adaptive evolution in response to global warming (2001) Science, 294, pp. 151-154; Falconer, D.S., Mackay, T.F.C., (1996) Introduction to quantitative genetics, , 4th, edn, Harlow, Longman; Fox, J., Bootstrapping regression models.
