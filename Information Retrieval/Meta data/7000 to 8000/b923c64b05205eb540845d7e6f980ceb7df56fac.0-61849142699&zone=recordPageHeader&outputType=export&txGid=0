We find carbon cycle uncertainty to be important. On average the spread in transient climate response is around 40% of that due to the more frequently debated uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity and global heat capacity. This result is derived by characterizing the influence of different parameters in a global climate-carbon cycle 'box' model that has been calibrated against the 11 General Circulation models (GCMs) and Earth system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) in the C4MIP ensemble; a collection of current state-of-the-art climate models that include an explicit representation of the global carbon cycle. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"carbon cycle; climate modeling; general circulation model; global warming; heat capacity; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,"Andrews, D.G., Allen, M.R., Diagnosis of climate models in terms of transient climate response and feedback response time (2008) Atmos.
