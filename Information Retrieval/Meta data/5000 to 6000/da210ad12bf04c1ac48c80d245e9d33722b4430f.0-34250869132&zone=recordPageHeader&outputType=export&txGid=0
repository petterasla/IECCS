In this article, we compare and discuss the different uses of four forecasting methods: (1) models that consider species individually, (2) niche-theory models that group species by habitat (more specifically, by environmental conditions under which a species can persist or does persist), (3) general circulation models and coupled ocean-atmosphere-biosphere models, and (4) species-area curve models that consider all species or large aggregates of species. After outlining the different uses and limitations of these methods, we make eight primary suggestions for improving forecasts. We find that greater use of the fossil record and of modern genetic studies would improve forecasting methods. We note a Quaternary conundrum: While current empirical and theoretical ecological results suggest that many species could be at risk from global warming, during the recent ice ages surprisingly few species became extinct. The potential resolution of this conundrum gives insights into the requirements for more accurate and reliable forecasting. Our eight suggestions also point to constructive synergies in the solution to the different problems. © 2007 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Biodiversity; Forecasting; Global warming; Modeling; Quaternary conundrum",,,,,,,"Araújo, M.B., New, M., Ensemble forecasting of species distribution (2007) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 22, pp. 42-47. , doi:10.1016/j.tree. 2006.09.010; Araújo, M.B., Pearson, R.G., Thuiller, W., Erhard, M., Validation of species-climate impact models under climate change (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 1504-1513; Araújo, M.B., Whittaker, R.J., Ladle, R., Erhard, M., Reducing uncertainty in projections of extinction risk from climate change (2005) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 14, pp. 529-538; Beaumont, L.J., Hughes, L., Potential changes in the distributions of latitudinally restricted Australian butterfly species in response to climate change (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 954-971; Bergengren, J.C., Thompson, S.L., Deconto, R.M., Modeling global climate-vegetation interactions in a doubled CO2 world (2001) Climatic Change, 50, pp. 31-75; Betts, R.A., Integrated approaches to climate-crop modelling:Needs and challenges (2005) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 360, pp. 2049-2065; Botkin, D.B., (1993) Forest Dynamics:An Ecological Model, , New York:Oxford University Press; Botkin, D.B., Simpson, L., Biomass of the North American boreal forest: A step toward accurate global measures (1990) Biogeochemistry, 9, pp. 161-174; Box, E.O., (1981) Macroclimate and Plant Forms: An Introduction to Predictive Modeling in Phytogeography, , The Hague: Junk; Bradshaw, W.E., Holzapfel, C.M., Evolutionary response to rapid climate change (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1477-1478; Brubaker, L.B., Anderson, P.M., Edwards, M.E., Lozhkin, A.V., Beringia as a glacial refugium for boreal trees and shrubs: New perspectives from mapped pollen data (2005) Journal of Biogeography, 32, pp. 833-848; Bürger, R., Lynch, M., Evolution and extinction in a changing environment: A quantitative-genetic analysis (1995) Evolution, 49, pp. 151-163; Bush, M.B., Hooghiemstra, H., Tropical biotic responses to climate change (2005) Climate Change and Biodiversity, pp. 151-163. , Lovejoy TE, Hannah L, eds, New Haven CT, Yale University Press; Connor, E.F., McCoy, E.D., Species-area relationships (2001) Encyclopedia of Biodiversity, 5, pp. 397-411. , Levin SA, ed, New York: Academic Press; Coulston, J.W., Riitters, K.H., Preserving biodiversity under current and future climates: A case study (2005) Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters, 14, pp. 31-38; Cox, P.M., Betts, R.A., Jones, C.D., Spall, S.A., Totterdell, I.J., Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 184-187; Cramer, W., Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: Results from six dynamic global vegetation models (2001) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 357-374; Davis, M.B., Botkin, D.B., Sensitivity of the cool-temperate forests and their fossil pollen to rapid climatic change (1985) Quaternary Research, 23, pp. 327-340; Diebold, F.X., Elements of Forecasting.
