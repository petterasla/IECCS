We propose a generic method to soften global constraints that can be represented by a flow in a graph. Such constraints are softened by adding violation arcs to the graph and then computing a minimum-weight flow in the extended graph to measure the violation. We present efficient propagation algorithms, based on different violation measures, achieving domain consistency for the alldifferent constraint, the global cardinality constraint, the regular constraint and the same constraint. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.","Global constraints; Network flows; Soft constraints","Algorithms; Computation theory; Global warming; Graph theory; Global constraints; Network flows; Propagation algorithms; Soft constraints; Constraint theory",,,,,,"Ahuja, R.K., Magnanti, T.L., Orlin, J.B., (1993) Network Flows, , Prentice Hall; Apt, K.R., (2003) Principles of Constraint Programming, , Cambridge University Press; Baptiste, P., Le Pape, C., Péridy, L., Global constraints for partial CSPs: A case-study of resource and due date constraints (1998) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP98), pp. 87-101. , M.J.
