The Nimbus 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) provide information on the global sea ice cover from 1978 to present. The two instruments flew simultaneously during a 6-week overlap period in July and August 1987. thus enabling intercomparison of the two sensors. Brightness temperatures are corrected for instrument drift and calibration differences in order to produce continuous time series of monthly averaged Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent and sea ice area through the use of the NOrwegian Remote Sensing Experiment (NORSEX) algorithm, which relates brightness temperatures to ice concentration. Statistical analysis on the time series estimates the decreases in Arctic ice extent and ice area to be 4.5% and 5.7%, respectively, during the 16.8-year observation period. The overall trends established here serve to better define and strengthen earlier assertions of a reduced ice cover, based on analysis of SMMR and SSMI data taken separately. These results are consistent with GCM simulations that suggest retreat of the sea ice cover under global warming scenarios.",,"Algorithms; Global warming; Microwave devices; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sensors; Temperature measurement; Time series analysis; Continuous time systems; Global warming; Luminance; Microwave devices; Microwave sensors; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Temperature; Time series; Time series analysis; Scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR); Special sensor microwave imager (SSMI); Sea ice; Ice; Antarctic sea ice; Brightness temperatures; Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Ice concentration; Observation Period; Satellite passive microwave; Scanning multichannel microwave radiometer; Special sensor microwave imagers",,,,,,"Cavalieri, D.J., Crawford, J.P., Drinkwater, M.R., Eppler, D.T., Farmer, L.D., Jentz, R.R., Wackerman, C.C., Aircraft active and passive-microwave validation of sea ice concentration from the DMSP SSMI (1991) J.
