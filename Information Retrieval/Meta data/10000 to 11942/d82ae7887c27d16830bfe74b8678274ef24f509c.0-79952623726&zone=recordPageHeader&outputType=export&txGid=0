Results of a long-term (32 years) experiment in the Indian Himalayas under rainfed soybean (Glycine max L.)- wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation was analyzed to determine the effects of mineral fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) application at 10 Mg ha-1 on SOC stocks and depth distribution of the labile and recalcitrant pools of SOC. Results indicate all treatments increased SOC contents over the control. The annual application of NPK significantly (P &lt; 0. 05) enhanced total SOC, oxidizable soil organic C and its fractions over the control plots. The increase in these SOC fractions was greater with the NPK + FYM treatment. Nearly 16% (mean of all treatments) of the estimated added C was stabilized into SOC both in the labile and recalcitrant pools, preferentially in the 0-30 cm soil layer. However, the labile:recalcitrant SOC ratios of applied C stabilized was largest in the 15-30 cm soil layer. About 62% of total SOC was present in the labile pool. Plots under the N + FYM and NPK + FYM treatments contained a larger proportion of total SOC in the recalcitrant pool than the plots with mineral or no fertilizer, indicating that FYM application promoted SOC stabilization. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon retention in soil; Farmyard manure application; Indian Himalayas; Labile and recalcitrant pools; Rainfed soybean-wheat rotation; Soil organic C fractions","agricultural practice; crop rotation; fertilizer application; global warming; long-term change; manure; mitigation; mountain region; sandy loam; soil organic matter; soybean; wheat; Himalayas; India; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Bhattacharyya, R., Ved-Prakash, K.S., Ghosh, B.N., Srivastva, A.K., Gupta, H.S., Potassium balance as influenced by farmyard manure application under continuous soybean-wheat cropping system in a Typic Haplaquept (2006) Geoder, 137, pp. 155-160; Bhattacharyya, R., Chandra, S., Singh, R.D., Kundu, S., Srivastva, A.K., Gupta, H.S., Long-term farmyard manure application effects on soil properties in a silty clay loam soil under irrigated wheat-soybean rotation (2007) Soil Tillage Res, 94, pp. 386-396; Bhattacharyya, R., Kundu, S., Pandey, S., Singh, K.P., Gupta, H.S., Tillage and irrigation effects on crop yields and soil properties under rice-wheat system of the Indian Himalayas (2008) Agril Water Manage, 95, pp. 993-1002; Bhattacharyya, R., Kundu, S., Ved-Prakash, G.H.S., Sustainability under combined application of mineral and organic fertilizers in a rainfed soybean-wheat system of the Indian Himalayas (2008) Eur J Agron, 28, pp. 32-46; Bhattacharyya, R., Ved-Prakash, K.S., Srivastva, A.K., Gupta, H.S., Soil aggregation and organic matter in a sandy clay loam soil of the Indian Himalayas under different tillage and crop regimes (2009) Ag Ecosyst Environ, 132, pp. 126-134; Bhattacharyya, R., Ved-Prakash, P.S.C., Kundu, S., Srivastva, A.K., Gupta, H.S., Effect of fertilization on carbon sequestration in soybean-wheat rotation under two contrasting soils and management practices in the Indian Himalayas (2009) Aus J Soil Res, 47, pp. 592-601; Bhattacharyya, R., Ved-Prakash, K.S., Srivastva, A.K., Gupta, H.S., Soil properties and their relationships with crop productivity after 30 years of different fertilization in the Indian Himalayas (2009) Arch Agron Soil Sci, 55, pp. 641-661; Blair, G.J., Lefroy, R.D.B., Lisle, L., Soil carbon fraction based on their degree of oxidation and the development of a carbon management index for agricultural systems (1995) Aus J Agric Res, 46, pp. 1456-1466; Campbell, C.A., Janzen, H.H., Juma, N.G., Case studies of soil quality in the Canadian prairies: long-term field experiments (1997) Soil Quality for Crop Production, pp. 351-397. , E.
