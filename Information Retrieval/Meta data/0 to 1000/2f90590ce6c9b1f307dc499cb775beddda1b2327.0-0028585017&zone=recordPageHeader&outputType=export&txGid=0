Frozen cores (n=40) of intact soils and vegetation were collected from a bog near Fairbanks, Alaska, and fluxes of CO2, CH4, and CO in response to water table variation were studied under controlled conditions in the Duke University phytotron. Outward fluxes of CO2 and CO were greatest during early thaw and decreased to near zero for both gases before the water table treatment started. Lower water table tripled CO2 flux to the atmosphere when compared with control cores. Carbon monoxide was emitted at low rates from high water table cores and consumed by low water table cores. Methane fluxes were low (&lt;1 mg m-2 d-1) in all cores during thaw. Although drying of wetland taiga soils may decrease CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, the associated increase in CO2 due to aerobic respiration will likely increase the global warming potential of gas emissions from these soils. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; methane flux; water table; USA, Alaska, Fairbanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08866236,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028585017
