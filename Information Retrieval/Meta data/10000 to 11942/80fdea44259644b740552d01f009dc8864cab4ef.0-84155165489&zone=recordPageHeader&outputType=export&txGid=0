Water stress is one of the most limiting factors constraining vegetation productivity in both direct and indirect ways (mainly through nutrition cycling). In this article, we first reviewed the concepts of hydrological and carbon cycles and their interactions and then summarized recent advances in our understanding of how global climate change affects water stress, ecosystem carbon cycling, disturbances, and water use efficiency. A warming climate may continue to benefit plant growth in energy limited areas such as high latitudes and altitudes. However, over many water-limited regions of the world, a warming climate has led to a drying trend, posing negative effects on land carbon sink capability, as shown by reductions in vegetation growth and increases in ecosystem disturbances (wildfires, insect outbreaks, and tree mortality). Carbon cycle and water use efficiency have responded to climate change in different ways in different areas. Further integrating information from climate records, flux measurements at eddy flux towers, and observations from satellites will greatly advance our understanding of the hydrological and carbon cycles and their evolution. Advancement in our understanding of the evolution of hydrological and carbon cycles under the changing climate will help us to adapt and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Climate change; Ecosystem disturbances; Hydrological and carbon cycles; Water stress; Water use efficiency","Adverse effect; Carbon cycles; Carbon cycling; Carbon sink; Changing climate; Climate record; Earth systems; Ecosystem disturbance; Ecosystem disturbances; Eddy fluxes; Flux measurements; Global change impacts; Global climate changes; High Latitudes; Hydrological and carbon cycles; Insect outbreaks; Integrating information; Landscape scale; Limiting factors; Plant growth; Tree mortality; Vegetation growth; Vegetation productivity; Warming climate; Water stress; Water use efficiency; Carbon; Earth (planet); Ecosystems; Forestry; Vegetation; Water supply; Climate change; carbon cycle; carbon sink; climate effect; evapotranspiration; global climate; hydrological cycle; water stress; water use efficiency; Carbon; Ecosystems; Evaporation; Hydrology; Mortality; Plants; Seasonal Variation; Transpiration; Water Supply; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Allen, C.D., Macalady, A.K., Chenchouni, H., Bachelet, D., McDowell, N., Vennetier, M., Kitzberger, T., Cobb, N., A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests (2010) Forest Ecology and Management, 259, pp. 660-684; Alley, R.B., Marotzke, J., Nordhaus, W.D., Overpeck, J.T., Peteet, D.M., Pielke Jr, R.A., Pierrehumbert, R.T., Wallace, J.M., Abrupt climate change (2003) Science, 299 (5615), pp. 2005-2010; Angert, A., Biraud, S., Bonfils, C., Henning, C.C., Buermann, W., Pinzon, J., Tucker, C.J., Fung, I., Drier summers cancel out the CO 2 uptake enhancement induced by warmer springs (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102, pp. 10823-10827; Avis, C.A., Weaver, A.J., Meissner, K.J., Reduction in areal extent of high-latitude wetlands in response to permafrost thaw (2011) Nature Geoscience, , DOI: 10.1038/ngeo1160; Baldocchi, D.D., Breathing of the terrestrial biosphere: lessons learned from a global network of carbon dioxide flux measurement systems (2008) Australian Journal of Botany, 56, pp. 1-26; Beer, C., Reichstein, M., Tomelleri, E., Ciais, P., Jung, M., Carvalhais, N., Rödenbeck, C., Papale, D., Terrestrial gross carbon dioxide uptake: global distribution and covariation with climate (2010) Science, 329, pp. 834-838; Boisvenue, C., Running, S.W., Impacts of climate change on natural forest productivity - evidence since the middle of the 20th century (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 1-21; Budyko, M.I., (1974) Climate and Life, , Academic: New York; Cao, L., Bala, G., Caldeira, K., Nemani, R., Ban-Weiss, G., Importance of carbon dioxide physiological forcing to future climate change (2010) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107 (2), pp. 9513-9518; Chapin III, F.S., Sturm, M., Serreze, M.C., McFadden, J.P., Key, J.R., Lloyd, A.H., McGuire, A.D., Welker, J.M., Role of land-surface changes in Arctic summer warming (2005) Science, 28 (310), pp. 657-660; Chapin III, F.S., Randerson, J.T., McGuire, A.D., Foley, J.A., Field, C.B., Changing feedbacks in the climate-biosphere system (2008) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 6 (6), pp. 313-320; Chen, M., Xie, P., Janowiak, J.E., Arkin, P.A., Global land precipitation: a 50-yr monthly analysis based on gauge observations (2002) Journal of Hydrometeorology, 3, pp. 249-266; Churkina, G., Running, S.W., Contrasting climatic controls on the estimated productivity of global terrestrial biomes (1998) Ecosystems, 1, pp. 206-215; Ciais, P., Reichstein, M., Viovy, N., Granier, A., Ogée, J., Allard, V., Buchmann, N., Valentini, R., Europe-wide reduction in primary productivity caused by the heat and drought in 2003 (2005) Nature, 437, pp. 529-533; Dai, A., Drought under global warming: a review (2011) Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, , DOI: 10.1002/wcc.81; Dai, A., Trenberth, K.E., Qian, T., A global dataset of Palmer Drought Severity Index for 1870-2002: relationship with soil moisture and effects of surface warming (2004) Journal of Hydrometeorology, 5, pp. 1117-1130; Davidson, E.A., Janssens, I.A., Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change (2006) Nature, 440, pp. 165-173; Dirmeyer, P.A., Gao, X., Zhao, M., Guo, Z., Oki, T., Hanasaki, N., GSWP-2: multimodel analysis and implications for our perception of the land surface (2006) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 87 (10), pp. 1381-1397; Donohue, R.J., Roderick, M.L., McVicar, T.R., On the importance of including vegetation dynamics in Budyko's hydrological model (2007) Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 11, pp. 983-995; Eagleson, P., (2002), Ecohydrology.
