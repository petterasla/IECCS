However, existing studies show that deglacial warming was asynchronous across the tropical band, complicating the identification of causal mechanisms. The Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico is ideally located to record subtropical Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST) warming in relation to meltwater input from the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Paired δ18O and Mg/Ca data on the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber from core EN32-PC6 are used to separate deglacial changes in SST and δ18O of seawater. SST as calculated from Mg/Ca data increased by &gt;3 °C from ca. 17.2 to 15.5 ka in association with Heinrich event 1 and was not in phase with Greenland air temperature. Subtracting temperature effects from δ18O values in G. ruber reveals two excursions representing Laurentide meltwater input to the Gulf of Mexico, one of &gt;1.5‰ from ca. 16.1 to 15.6 ka and a second major spike of &gt;2.5‰ from ca. 15.2 to 13.0 ka that encompassed meltwater pulse 1A and peaked ca. 13.8 ka during the Bølling-Ållerød. Conversion to salinity through the use of a Laurentide meltwater end member of -25‰ indicates that near-surface salinity decreased by 2‰-4‰ during these spikes. These results suggest that Gulf of Mexico SST warming preceded peak Laurentide Ice Sheet decay and the Bølling-Ållerød interval by &gt;2 k.y. and that heat was retained in the subtropical Atlantic during Heinrich event 1, consistent with modulation of deglacial climate by thermohaline circulation. © 2004 Geological Society of America.","Deglaciation; Freshwater switching; Gulf of Mexico; Laurentide Ice Sheet; Meltwater floods; Orca Basin","Deglaciations; Ice sheet; Sea-surface temperature (SST); Tropical climate system; Glaciers; Ice; Melting; Modulation; Salinity measurement; Seawater; Tropics; Climate change; deglaciation; freshwater input; Laurentide Ice Sheet; meltwater; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; sea surface temperature; warming; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico",,,,,,"Aharon, P., Meltwater flooding events in the Gulf of Mexico revisited: Implications for rapid climate changes during the last deglaciation (2003) Paleoceanography, 18, p. 1079. , doi: 10.1029/2002PA000840; Bard, E., Hamelin, B., Fairbanks, R.G., Zindler, A., Calibration of the 14C timescale over the past 30,000 years using mass spectrometric U-Th ages from Barbados corals (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 405-410; Barker, S., Greaves, M., Elderfield, H., A study of cleaning procedures used for foraminiferal Mg/Ca paleothermometry (2003) Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, 4. , doi: 10.1029/2003GCO00559; Bemis, B.E., Spero, H.J., Bijma, J., Lea, D.W., Reevaluation of the oxygen isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera: Experimental results and revised paleotemperature equations (1998) Paleoceanography, 13, pp. 150-160; Blunier, T., Brook, E.J., Timing of millennial-scale climate change in Antarctica and Greenland during the last glacial period (2001) Science, 291, pp. 109-112; Boyle, E.A., Keigwin, L.D., North Atlantic thermohaline circulation during the past 20,000 years linked to high-latitude surface temperature (1987) Nature, 330, pp. 35-40; Broecker, W.S., Paleocean circulation during the last deglaciation: A bipolar seesaw?
