Studies forecast that Australia will experience increasing heat waves and droughts. Heat stress caused by frequent heat waves will have a marked effect on older Australians due to physiological and pharmacological factors. In this paper we present an overview of some of the foreseeable issues which older Australians will face from a public health perspective.",,"article; Australia; greenhouse effect; human; public health; Australia; Global Warming; Humans; Public Health",,,,,,"Climate change faster in Australia: scientists, , http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/Headlines/, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Earth Observatory, NASA. 3 Jan 2007.
