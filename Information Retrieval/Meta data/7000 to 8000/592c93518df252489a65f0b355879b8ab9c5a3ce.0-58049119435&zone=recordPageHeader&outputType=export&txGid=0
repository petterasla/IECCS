From comparison of the observation and the 20C3M experiment, it is found that the multi-model ensemble quite well simulates the Northeast Asian summer precipitation and circulation, especially in the first two empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes and the associated regressed field. The first EOF mode represents the decaying phase of El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which contributes to the development of the Philippines Sea anticyclone. The second one is associated with the fast transition of ENSO. In future climate, the increase of the precipitation to 2099 at A2, and A1B simulation reaches 10% compared with the mean precipitation for 1961-1990 over the Northeast Asian region. After the stabilization of the greenhouse gas concentration in 2100, the precipitation is enhanced during 30 or 50 years more due to the inertia inherent in the climate system. From EOF analysis, it seems that the increased Northeast Asian summer precipitation due to global warming is contributed by the effect of the enhanced monsoon circulation in the decaying phase of El Nino rather than the mean linear increase of global climate or the circulation in the fast transitional period of ENSO. © 2008, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"anticyclone; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric general circulation model; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; ensemble forecasting; experimental study; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; observational method; oceanic general circulation model; performance assessment; precipitation assessment; summer; weather forecasting; Asia; Eurasia; Northeast Asia",,,,,,"Ammann, C.M., Meehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Zender, C., A monthly and latitudinally varying volcanic forcing dataset in simulations of 20th century climate (2003) Geophys.
