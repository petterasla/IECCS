Modeled physiological response indices explained 40-60% of variation in radial growth indices. To evaluate the effects of global warming, daily temperature values for the period 1900-1987 were increased by 2 or 5°C, without changing precipitation values. Under the warming scenarios, OAKWBAL predicted a substantial increase in growing season woody respiration (Rw), but little change in growing season net photosynthesis (Pnet). Warming merely shifted the period of near-maximal Pnet earlier in the growing season, without changing its duration. However, this result was somewhat dependent upon the ability of leaf-out phenology to track changes in temperature regime. The net effect of increased Rw with little change in Pnet was a reduction in radial growth and a higher frequency of years with climatic conditions stressful to oaks on upland sites. A historical association between severe drought and increased incidence of oak growth decline and mortality indicated that global warming could increase the incidence of decline and mortality in oak populations on upland sites similar to those in this study. -from Authors",,"black oak; global warming; oak; white oak; Quercus alba; Quercus velutina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00455067,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027072165
