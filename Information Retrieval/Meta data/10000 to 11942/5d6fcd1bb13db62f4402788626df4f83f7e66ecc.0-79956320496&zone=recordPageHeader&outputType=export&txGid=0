Taiwan is geographically situated in a subtropical climate zone which is deemed as a future model of Japanese climate if global warming continues. It is therefore advantageous for Japanese to know the present IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) situations in Taiwan. The research was carried out in two phases. The first phase used questionnaire surveys to collect the relevant information of the occupants and their living environments, and QEESI questionnaires (Chinese version) for information regarding their health conditions. In the second phase, IAQ measurements were conducted in the 40 houses which were selected among volunteers of the first survey. Measurement items were temperature, humidity and concentrations of carbonyl compounds and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). Verification measurements were conducted to investigate the hypothesis in the two houses, A and B, selected from 40 measured houses. The amount of furnishing materials in the two houses was quite different. Finally, the questionnaire results, QEESI (Quick Exposure Sensitivity Inventory) scores, and IAQ data were compared accordingly to determine the factors that cause SHS (Sick House Syndrome). The results are as follows. 1. For areas deficient in SHS and/or MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) diagnoses, combining QEESI investigations and IAQ measurements in the surveys is successful in screening SH and discovering SHS. 2. To reduce indoor air pollution effectively, it is insufficient just to regulate the materials and the quantity of interior furnishings. Construction process, ventilation rate, airflow path, and an overall plan with strict assessment should all be included in the regulations.","Field survey; IAQ; Occupant's health; Sick house syndrome; Southern Taiwan",,,,,,,"Yoshino, H., Field Survey on IAQ Occupants' Health in sick houses (2009) Journal of Environmental Engineering, 74 (641), pp. 803-809. , 2009-7; Miller, C.S., Prihoda, T.J., The Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (EESI).
