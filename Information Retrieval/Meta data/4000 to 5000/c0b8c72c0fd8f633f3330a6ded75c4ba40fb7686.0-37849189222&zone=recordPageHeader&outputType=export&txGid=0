For steel industry, the pressure of reducing CO2 emission is likely to last many years. During the past decades, the CO2 emission per ton steel has been reduced mainly due to the improvement of energy efficiency. Entering the 21st century, the steel manufacturing route must have three functions, namely, production of high performance steel products, conversion of energy, and treatment of waste. In the near future, it is expected that existing BF-BOF and EAF routes will be improved, in order to produce high performance steels, increase the use of scrap, and integrate steel industry with other industries for mitigating CO2 emission. In the long term, using carbon-free energy, reducing agents, and storing CO2 securely or converting CO2 into a harmless substance can be presumed for tremendous reduction in CO2 emission. © 2006 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.","CO2 emission; emission mitigation; global warming; steel industry",,,,,,,"Yeonbae, K., Ernst, W., International Comparison of CO2 Emission Trends in the Iron and Steel Industry [J] (2002) Energy Policy, 30 (10), pp. 827-838; Karl-Hermann, T., Rolf, S., Hydrogen for the Reduction of Iron Ores-State of the Art and Future Aspects [J] (2004) Stahl und Eisen, 124 (4), pp. 45-52; Hans, S., Rune, L., Birgitta, L., CO2 Emissions of the Swedish Steel Industry [J] (2001) Scandinavian Journal of Metallurgy, 30 (6), pp. 420-425; Sakamoto, Y., Tonooka, Y., Estimation of CO2 Emission for Each Process in the Japanese Steel Industry: a Process Analysis [J] (2000) International Journal of Energy Research, 24 (7), pp. 625-632; Jean-Pierre, B., Jean-Pierre, V., Michel, S., (2000) CO2 Emissions and the Steel Industry's Available Responses to the Greenhouse Effect [A].
