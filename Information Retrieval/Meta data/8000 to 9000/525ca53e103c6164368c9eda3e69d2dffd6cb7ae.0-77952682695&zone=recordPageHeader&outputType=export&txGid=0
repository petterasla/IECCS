In wheat, barley, and various other commercially important crops, the early phase of anther development is especially susceptible to high temperatures. Activation of auxin biosynthesis with increased temperatures has been reported in certain plant tissues. In contrast, we here found that under high temperature conditions, endogenous auxin levels specifically decreased in the developing anthers of barley and Arabidopsis. In addition, expression of the YUCCA auxin biosynthesis genes was repressed by increasing temperatures. Application of auxin completely reversed male sterility in both plant species. These findings suggest that tissue-specific auxin reduction is the primary cause of high temperature injury, which leads to the abortion of pollen development. Thus, the application of auxin may help sustain steady yields of crops despite future climate change.","Anther; Arabidopsis; Barley; Heat stress; Phytohormone","auxin; anther; Arabidopsis; article; barley; biosynthesis; climate change; controlled study; gene expression; gene repression; nonhuman; plant development; plant disease; plant male sterility; plant reproduction; pollen development; priority journal; temperature stress; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Glucuronidase; Hordeum; Hot Temperature; Indoleacetic Acids; Oxygenases; Plant Infertility; Pollen; Seeds; Arabidopsis; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",,"Arabidopsis Proteins; Glucuronidase, 3.2.1.31; Indoleacetic Acids; Oxygenases, 1.13.-; YUC protein, Arabidopsis, 1.13.14.-",,,,"(2007) Fourth Assessment Report, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Lobell, D.B., Field, C.B., Global scale climate - Crop yield relationships and the impacts of recent warming (2007) Environ Res Lett, 2, p. 014002; Sakata, T., Takahashi, H., Nishiyama, I., Higashitani, A., Effects of High Temperature on the Development of Pollen Mother Cells and Microspores in Barley Hordeum vulgare L (2000) Journal of Plant Research, 113 (1112), pp. 395-402; Abiko, M., Akibayashi, K., Sakata, T., Kimura, M., Kihara, M., Itoh, K., Asamizu, E., Higashitani, A., High-temperature induction of male sterility during barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) anther development is mediated by transcriptional inhibition (2005) Sexual Plant Reproduction, 18 (2), pp. 91-100. , DOI 10.1007/s00497-005-0004-2; Oshino, T., Abiko, M., Saito, R., Ichiishi, E., Endo, M., Kawagishi-Kobayashi, M., Higashitani, A., Premature progression of anther early developmental programs accompanied by comprehensive alterations in transcription during high-temperature injury in barley plants (2007) Molecular Genetics and Genomics, 278 (1), pp. 31-42. , DOI 10.1007/s00438-007-0229-x; Saini, H.S., Sedgley, M., Aspinall, D., Effect of heat stress during floral development on pollen tube growth and ovary anatomy in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)
