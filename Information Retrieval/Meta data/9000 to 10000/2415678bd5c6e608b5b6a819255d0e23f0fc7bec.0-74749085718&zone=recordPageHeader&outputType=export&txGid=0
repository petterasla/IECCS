Contradictory effects, however, were reported in previous studies. To investigate the effects of crop residue management on N2O emissions from rice-wheat rotation ecosystems, we conducted field experiments at three sites (Suzhou, Wuxi and Jiangdu) in the Yangtze River Delta, using static chamber and gas chromatography methods. Our data show that N2O emissions throughout the rice season from plots treated with wheat straw application at a high rate (WS) prior to rice transplanting (1. 1-2. 0 kg N ha-1) were significantly lower (P &lt; 0. 05) than those from the control plots without organic matter addition or added with wheat straw at a moderate rate (1. 6-2. 9 kg N ha-1). Furthermore, the WS treatments had a residual inhibitory effect on N2O emissions in the following non-rice season, which consistently resulted in significantly lower emissions (P &lt; 0. 05) compared to the control treatments (2. 2-3. 1 vs. 3. 9-5. 6 kg N ha-1). In comparison to the control treatments, the WS treatments reduced both the seasonal and annual direct emission factors of the applied nitrogen (EFd) by 50-68% (mean: 57%). The addition of compost (aerobically composted rice or wheat straw harvested in the last rotation) reduced the seasonal and annual EFds by 29-32%. Over the entire rice-wheat rotation cycle, annual N2O emissions from the fertilized fields at the three sites ranged from 3. 3 ± 0. 3 to 16. 8 ± 0. 6 kg N ha-1, with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 61%. Similarly, the EFds during the rice-wheat rotation cycle ranged from 0. 4% to 2. 5%, with a CV of 67%. These high spatial variations might have been related to: variations in soil properties, such as texture and soil organic carbon; management practices, such as straw treatments (i. e., compost versus fresh straw) and weather conditions, such as precipitation and rainfall distribution. Our results indicate that the incorporation of fresh wheat straw at a high rate during the rice season is an effective management practice for the mitigation of N2O emissions in rice-wheat rotation systems. Whether this practice is also effective in reducing the overall global warming potential of net N2O, CH4 and CO2 emissions needs to be seen through further studies. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","Compost; Emission factor; N fertilizer; Nitrous oxide; Rice-wheat rotation; Wheat straw","agricultural emission; crop residue; crop rotation; gas chromatography; global warming; management practice; nitrous oxide; rice; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil organic matter; soil texture; spatial variation; wheat; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Akiyama, H., Tsuruta, H., Effect of organic matter application on N2O, NO and NO2 fluxes from an Andisol field (2003) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 17. , doi: 10. 1029/2002GB002016; Akiyama, H., Yagi, K., Yan, X.Y., Direct N2O emissions from rice paddy fields: Summary of available data (2005) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 19. , doi: 10. 1029/2004GB002378; Aulakh, M.S., Doran, D.T., Walter, D.T., Mosier, A.R., Francis, D.D., Crop residue type and placement effects on denitrification and mineralization (1991) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 55, pp. 1020-1025; Aulakh, M.S., Khera, T.S., Doran, J.W., Bronson, K.F., Denitrification, N2O and CO2 fluxes in rice-wheat cropping system as affected by crop residues, fertilizer N and legume green manure (2001) Biol Fertil Soils, 34, pp. 375-389; Baggs, E.M., Rees, R.M., Smith, K.A., Vinten, A.J.A., Nitrous oxide emission from soils after incorporating crop residues (2000) Soil Use Manage, 16, pp. 82-87; Baggs, E.M., Millar, N., Ndufa, J.K., Cadisch, G., (2001) Effect of Residue Quality on N2O Emissions from Tropical Soils, in Sustainable Management of Soil Organic Matter, pp. 120-125. , R.
