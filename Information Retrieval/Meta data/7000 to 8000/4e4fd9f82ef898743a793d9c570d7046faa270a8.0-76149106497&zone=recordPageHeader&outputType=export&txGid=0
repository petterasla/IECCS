We monitored vegetation cover and the soil seed bank to study the diversity and functional group gap dynamics in burned and unburned sites. Species were grouped into 3 functional groups: forbs, fugitive species, and annual grasses. Post-drought vegetation recovered quickly due to a rainy spring in the second year but decreased after a dry and warm spring in the third year. These patterns underline the close relationship that exists between phenological phases and meteorological variables. Drought decreased richness but did not affect the presence of stress-tolerant species, whereas fire increased richness by allowing the establishment of fugitive species. Species in the fugitive functional group may be fire adapted and depend on seed accumulation in the seed bank (storage effect) to coexist with other gap species. Forbs exhibited their highest vegetation cover and seed bank density in the unburned site. Global climate change suggests an increase in the frequency and amplitude of El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomena that, in northwestern Patagonia, are related to the occurrence of drought, fire, and changes in vegetation dynamics.","El Niño/Southern oscillation; Fugitive species; Mechanisms of coexistence; Seed bank; Vegetation dynamics","drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental impact; fire behavior; functional group; gap dynamics; grassland; meteorology; phenology; seed bank; species diversity; vegetation dynamics; Patagonia; Poaceae",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.A., Ackerly, D.D., Adler, F., Arnold, A.E., Cáceres, C., Doak, D.F., Post, E., Werner, E., Filling key gaps in population and community ecology (2007) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 5, pp. 145-152; Chesson, P., Warner, R., Environmental variability promotes coexistence in lottery competitive systems (1981) American Naturalist, 117, pp. 923-943; Chesson, P., Gebauer, R.L.E., Schwinning, S., Huntly, N., Wiegand, K., Ernest, K., Sher, S.K.M., Weltzin, J.F., Resource pulses, species interactions and diversity maintenance in arid and semi-arid environments (2004) Oecologia, 141, pp. 236-253; Coelho, C.A.S., Stephenson, D.B., Balmaseda, M., Doblas-Reyes, F.J., Van Oldenborgh, G.J., Toward an integrated seasonal forecasting system for South America (2006) Journal of Climate, 19, pp. 3704-3721; Daniels, L.D., Veblen, T.T., ENSO effects on temperature and precipitation of the Patagonian-Andean region: Implications for biogeography (2000) Physical Geography, 21, pp. 223-243; Facelli, J.M., Chesson, P., Barnes, N., Differences in seed biology of annual plants in arid lands: A key ingredient of the storage effect (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2298-3006; Fenner, M., The phenology of growth and reproduction in plants (1998) Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, 1, pp. 78-91; Funes, G., Basconcelo, S., Díaz, S., Cabido, M., Seed size and shape are good predictors of seed persistence in soil in temperate mountain grasslands of Argentina (1999) Seed Science Research, 9, pp. 341-345; Ghermandi, L., Caracterización del banco de semillas de una estepa en el noroeste de la Patagonia (1992) Ecología Austral, 2, pp. 39-46; Ghermandi, L., Seasonal patterns in the seed bank of a grassland in north-western Patagonia (1997) Journal of Arid Environments, 35, pp. 215-224; Ghermandi, L., Guthmann, N., Bran, D., Early post-fire succession in northwestern Patagonia grasslands (2004) Journal of Vegetation Science, 15, pp. 67-76; Golluscio, R.Q., Sala, O.E., Lauenroth, W.K., Differential use of large summer rainfall events by shrubs and grasses: A manipulative experiment in the Patagonia steppe (1998) Oecologia, 115, pp. 17-25; Gonzalez, S., (2002) El Banco de Semillas Como Estrategia de Regeneración Post-fuego en un Pastizal Del Noroeste de la Patagonia, , Thesis Licenciatura.
