The point of departure is 1983 with the publication of the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences report Changing Climate (1983). The present author was chairman of the report committee and considers this an appropriate time for an update. The advances (or retreats) in the overall science are reviewed with special emphasis on those that have critical policy implications. © 1995.","Carbon cycle; Climate change; Climate modeling","climate change; global warming; scientific review",,,,,,"Fris-Christensen, Lassen, The length of the solar cycle: an indicator of solar activity closely associated with climate (1991) Science, 254, pp. 698-700; Lauchenbruch, Marshall, Changing climate: geothermal evidence from permafrost in the Alaskan Arctic (1986) Science, 234, pp. 689-696; Lewis, T J (ed) ‘Climatic change inferred from underground temperatures’ Special Issue Global and Planetary Change 6 71–281Lindzen, R (1993) private communicationMacDonald, Clathrates (1992) Enc.
