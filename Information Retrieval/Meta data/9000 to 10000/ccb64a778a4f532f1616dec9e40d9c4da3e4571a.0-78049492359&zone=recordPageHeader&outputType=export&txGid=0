On the one hand, warming and increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration stimulate vegetation productivity, taking up CO 2. On the other hand, warming accelerates the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), releasing carbon into the atmosphere. Here, the NHL terrestrial carbon storage is investigated based on 10 models from the Coupled Carbon Cycle Climate Model Intercomparison Project. Our analysis suggests that the NHL will be a carbon sink of 0.3 ± 0.3 PgCyr -1 by 2100. The cumulative land organic carbon storage is modeled to increase by 38 ± 20 PgC over 1901 levels, of which 17 ± 8 PgC comes from vegetation (43%) and 21 ± 16 PgC from the soil (8%). Both CO 2 fertilization and warming enhance vegetation growth in the NHL. Although the intense warming there enhances SOM decomposition, soil organic carbon (SOC) storage continues to increase in the 21st century. This is because higher vegetation productivity leads to more turnover (litterfall) into the soil, a process that has received relatively little attention. However, the projected growth rate of SOC begins to level off after 2060 when SOM decomposition accelerates at high temperature and then catches up with the increasing input from vegetation turnover. Such competing mechanisms may lead to a switch of the NHL SOC pool from a sink to a source after 2100 under more intense warming, but large uncertainty exists due to our incomplete understanding of processes such as the strength of the CO 2 fertilization effect, permafrost, and the role of soil moisture. Unlike the CO 2 fertilization effect that enhances vegetation productivity across the world, global warming increases the productivity at high latitudes but tends to reduce it in the tropics and mid-latitudes. These effects are further enhanced as a result of positive carbon cycle-climate feedbacks due to additional CO 2 and warming. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biomass turnover; C4MIP; Carbon-climate feedback; Climate change; CO 2; Northern High Latitudes; NPP; SOM decomposition; Terrestrial carbon","biological uptake; biomass allocation; carbon balance; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate feedback; climate modeling; concentration (composition); global warming; latitudinal gradient; soil organic matter; terrestrial ecosystem; twenty first century",,,,,,"Alexeev, V.A., Langen, P.L., Bates, J.R., Polar amplification of surface warming on an aquaplanet in 'ghost forcing' experiments without sea ice feedbacks (2005) Climate Dynamics, 24, pp. 655-666; Arseneault, D., Payette, S., A postfire shift from lichen-spruce to lichen-tundra vegetation at tree line (1992) Ecology, 73, pp. 1067-1081; Bala, G., Caldeira, K., Mirin, A., Wickett, M., Delire, C., Phillips, T.J., Biogeophysical effects of CO 2-fertilization on global climate (2006) Tellus, 58 B, pp. 620-627; Bergner, B., Johnston, J., Treseder, K.K., Experimental warming and burn severity alter soil CO 2 flux and soil functional groups in a recently burned boreal forest (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 1996-2004; Bond-Lamberty, B., Peckham, S.D., Ahl, D.E., Fire as the dominant driver of central Canadian boreal forest carbon balance (2007) Nature, 450, pp. 89-92; Bond-Lamberty, B., Wang, C., Gower, S.T., Contribution of root respiration to soil surface CO 2 flux in a boreal black spruce chronosequence (2004) Tree Physiology, 24, pp. 1387-1395; Bronson, D.R., Gower, S.T., Tanner, M., Response of soil surface CO 2 flux in a boreal forest to ecosystem warming (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 856-867; Brown, J., Romanovsky, V.E., Report from the International Permafrost Association: state of permafrost in the first decade of the 21st century (2008) Permafrost and Periglacial Processes, 19, pp. 255-260; Callaghan, T.V., Björn, L.O., Chapin, F.S., Arctic tundra and polar desert ecosystems (2005) Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (eds Symon C, Arris L, Heal B), pp. 243-352. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Callaghan, T.V., Björn, L.O., Chernov, Y., Effects of changes in climate on landscape and regional processes, and feedbacks to the climate system (2004) Ambio, 33, pp. 459-468; Certini, G., Effects of fire on properties of forest soils: a review (2005) Oecologia, 143, pp. 1-10; Chapin, F.S., Matthews, E., Boreal carbon pools: approaches and constraints in global extrapolations.
