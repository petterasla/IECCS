So, CH4 emission must be controlled in order to restrain the greenhouse effect. However, coalbed methane (CBM) emission is an important source of the methane in the atmosphere. Wherefore, it is of significance to study conversion of CBM to methanol for reducing CH4 emission into the atmosphere. Technologies of syngas production from CBM, including coupling of CBM deoxygenation and CH4 steam rearming, coupling of CH4 partial oxidation and CO2 rearming, and non-catalytic transforming of CBM, are introduced. The method of making methanol with syngas is also described. Moreover, based on the increase trend of atmospheric methane and the destructive effect of CH 4 on environment, the environmental benefit on methanol production with CBM is discussed. At the same time, those problems, which should be adverted in the process of synthesizing methanol with CBM, are emphasized.","Environmental benefit; Methanol; Oxygen-containing cbm; Syngas","chemosynthesis; coalbed methane; cost-benefit analysis; coupling; global warming; methanol; oxidation; oxygen",,,,,,"Rao, M., Gas drainage and application of coal bed methane in China underground coal mines [J] (2002) Coal Science and Technology, 30, pp. 61-63. , (in Chinese); Tao, W., Gu, G., Zhang, J., Probing into methanol production from CMM [J] (2008) Natural Gas Chemical Industry, 33 (4), pp. 47-53. , (in Chinese); Van Hook, J.P., Methane-steam reforming [J] (1980) Catal.Rev.Sci.Eng., 21 (1), pp. 1-51; Rostrup-Nielsen, J.R., Production of synthesis gas [J] (1993) Catal.Today., 18 (4), pp. 305-324; Xu, D., (2005) Synthesis of Liquid Hydrocarbons from Coalmine Drained Methane Via Syngas DJ, 4, pp. 3-59. , Dalian: Chinese Academy of Sciences, (in Chinese); Li, Q., Liao, Z., Du, S., Design for the process of methanol production from recovered coal-bed gas by non-catalytic transforming [J] (2006) China Foreign Energy, 11 (5), pp. 95-110. , (in Chinese); He, L., Shen, Z., (2005) The Progress of Methane Conversion and Application [M], (4), pp. 152-174. , Beijing: Chemical Industry Press, (in Chinese); Zhang, F., Xu, L., Effect of methane on global warming and mitigating measures [J] (2004) Mining Safety & Environmental Protection, 31 (5), pp. 6-9. , (in Chinese); Milich.
