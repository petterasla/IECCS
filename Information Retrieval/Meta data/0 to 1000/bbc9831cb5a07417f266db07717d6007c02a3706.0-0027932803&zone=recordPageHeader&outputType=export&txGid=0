Building on classical Greek theories linking deforestation to rainfall decline the colonial climatic theorists were stimulated by the Newtonian thinking of Stephen Hales and his disciples. The new climate theories led to pioneering forest protection schemes in Tobago, St Vincent, St Helena, Mauritius and western India where the East India Company actively promoted conservation. The Royal Society of Arts, the Academie des Sciences and the Royal Geographical Society all acted as institutional mechanisms for encouraging forest protection based on fears of climate change, long before early environmentalism developed in the United States.",,"rain; article; atlantic islands; caribbean islands; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; forest; global climate; history; human; india; nonhuman; south asia; united states; Mauritius",,,,,,,"Grove, R.H.; Department of Economic History, Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia",,,,,,,,00456535,,CMSHA,,"English","CHEMOSPHERE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027932803
