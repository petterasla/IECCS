Completed, ongoing, and preliminary studies conducted at Bog Run Bog, WV, Bog Lake Bog, MN, and Wetland 307 of the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario have included 1) a reciprocal transplant of dominant hummock and hollow Sphagnum species, examining growth in length, 2) a reciprocal transplant of peat, with periodic retrieval of transplanted samples and analysis of CO2 and CH4 production under anoxic and oxic conditions at field temperature and at 22°C, 3)14C-labeling of vegetation in hollow, hummock, and shrub plots, following the fate of a single day's photosynthetic fixation through aboveground and belowground components over time, and 4) a preliminary analysis of13C ratios in peat and of the CH4 that is produced and emitted. Collectively, these studies provide support for the premise that comparative studies of northern (cooler climate) and southern (warmer climate) peatland sites may provide insights into potential functional changes in boreal peatlands under predicted scenarios of global climate change. © 1994 Society of Wetland Scientists.","global climate change; latitudinal gradient; peatlands; Sphagnum",,,,,,,,"Wieder, R.K.; Department of Biology, Villanova University, Villanova, 19085, Pennsylvania, United States",,,,,,,,02775212,,,,"English","Wetlands",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027948068
