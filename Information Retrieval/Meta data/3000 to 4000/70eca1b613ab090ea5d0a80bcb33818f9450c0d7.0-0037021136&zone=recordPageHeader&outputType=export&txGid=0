In general, there is either an inverse relationship or a weak relationship between mean and standard deviation. For both daily maximum and daily minimum air temperature, the inverse relationship is spatially coherent for one-third to two-thirds of the contiguous USA for most months. The inverse relationship also is fairly strong, with typical reductions in standard deviation ranging from 0.2 to 0.5°C for every 1°C increase in mean temperature. A weaker, direct relationship between mean and standard deviation occurs in some northern states, primarily during spring and fall months. Using the predominant inverse and weak relationships as historical analogs for future climatic change suggests that interdiurnal variability of air temperature should either decrease or remain unchanged under warming conditions. Although the variability of air temperature may decrease or remain unchanged at most locations in the contiguous USA, the probability of extremely high air temperatures should still increase, depending on the magnitude of changes in mean air temperature and the nature of the variance response.","Air temperature; Climatic variability; Global warming; Probability distributions","air temperature; climate change; global warming; United States",,,,,,"Balling R.C., Jr., Skindlov, J.A., Phillips, D.H., The impact of increasing summer mean temperatures on extreme maximum and minimum temperatures in Phoenix, Arizona (1990) J Clim, 3, pp. 1491-1494; Barrow, E.M., Hulme, M., Changing probabilities of daily air temperature extremes in the UK related to future global warming and changes in climate variability (1996) Clim Res, 6, pp. 21-31; Brinkmann, W.A.R., Variability of temperature in Wisconsin (1983) Mon Weather Rev, 111, pp. 172-179; Cooter, E.J., LeDuc, S.K., Recent frost date trends in the north-eastern USA (1995) Int J Climatol, 15, pp. 65-75; Davis, J.C., (1986) Statistics and Data Analysis in Geology, , 2nd edn.
