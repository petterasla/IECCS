It is found that the late spring and early summer (May-June) are the months with the strongest responses of vegetation to global warming. Based on the Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) method, the study shows that the first REOF spatial pattern of average NDVI for May-June reveals the northern and southern zones with great inter-annual variations of vegetation, the northern zone from the eastern Kunlun Mountains to the southwestern Qilian Mountain and southern zone from the northern edge of the Himalayas eastward to the Hengduan Mountains. The vegetation, especially grassland, in the two zones increases significantly with global warming, with a correlation coefficient of 0.71 between the first REOF of May-June vegetation and the April-May surface air temperature anomaly in the NH during 1982-2002. A long-term increasing trend in May-June vegetation for the plateau region as a whole is also attributed mainly to global warming although there are considerable regional differences. The areas with low NDVI (grassland and shrubland) usually respond more evidently to global warming, especially since the 1990s, than those with moderate or high NDVI values.","Global warming; NDVI; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; REOF; Vegetation","air temperature; anomaly; global warming; grassland; NDVI; Northern Hemisphere; shrubland; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Hengduan Mountains; Himalayas; Kunlun Mountains; Qilian Mountains; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,,,,,"Agbu, P.A., James, M.E., (1994) The NOAA/NASA Pathfinder A VHRR Land Data Set User's Manual, , Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center, Green-belt; Defries, R., Hansen, M., Townshend, J.R.G., Global land cover classifications at 8km spatial resolution: The use of training data derived from Landsat imagery in decision tree classifiers (1998) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 19, pp. 3141-3168; Qishun, F., Zhanjiang, S., Guangchao, C., Assessment of ecology and environments on climate changing of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (2005) Journal of Salt Lake Research, 13 (1), pp. 12-18. , in Chinese; Daoyi, G., Peijun, S., Xuezhao, H., Spatial features of the coupling between spring NDVI and temperature over Northern Hemisphere (2002) Acta Geographica Sinica, 57 (5), pp. 505-514. , in Chinese; Hansen J E, Ruedy R, Sato M et al., 2006.
