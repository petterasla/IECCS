It estimates carbon sequestration in the crop and in mill products and by-products, and balances this against the major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), all converted to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e) over the 25-year lifespan of the crop. The model shows that most carbon sequestration occurs in the standing crop, with smaller amounts in mill products and by-products. Land-use conversion plays a dominant role in the GHG budget, with planting of oil palm after logged forest or rubber leading to a net loss of carbon, and to a net gain following grassland. In the default oil-palm-to-oil-palm case the carbon lost from cleared palms is balanced by sequestration in the current crop. Methane from mill effluent and nitrous oxide from N fertilizers are the next most important emission sources. The default replant case gives net emissions of 0.86t CO2-e per t crude palm oil, but these can be reduced to very low values, mainly through conversion of methane and surplus fuel in the mill to energy. © 2010 Earthscan.","Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-use conversion; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Palm oil","agricultural emission; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; crop production; effluent; fertilizer; global warming; grassland; greenhouse gas; land use change; methane; mill; nitrous oxide; oil production; vegetable oil; Elaeis",,,,,,"Ahmad, H., Ahmad Zamri, M.Y., Mechanisation in oil palm plantations (2000) Advances in Oil Palm Research, 1, pp. 653-696. , Y.
