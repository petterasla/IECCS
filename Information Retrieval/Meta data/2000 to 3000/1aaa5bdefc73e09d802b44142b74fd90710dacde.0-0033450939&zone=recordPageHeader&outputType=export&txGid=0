At the regional scale, we suggest that attention can be focused more dearly on understanding the relative strengths of predicted net primary productivity (NPP) limitation by energy, water, and nutrients. We evaluate the sources of variability among model predictions of NPP with a regional-scale comparison between estimates made by PnET-II (a forest ecosystem process model previously applied to the northeastern region) and TEM 4.0 (a terrestrial biosphere model typically applied to the globe) for the northeastern US. When the same climate, vegetation, and soil data sets were used to drive both models, regional average NPP predictions made by PnET-II and TEM were remarkably similar, and at the biome level, model predictions agreed fairly well with NPP estimates developed from field measurements. However, TEM 4.0 predictions were more sensitive to regional variations in temperature as a result of feedbacks between temperature and belowground N availability. In PnET-II, the direct link between transpiration and photosynthesis caused substantial water stress in hardwood and pine forest types with increases in solar radiation; predicted water stress was relieved substantially when soil water holding capacity (WHC) was increased. Increasing soil WHC had little effect on TEM 4.0 predictions because soil water storage was already sufficient to meet plant demand with baseline WHC values, and because predicted N availability under baseline conditions in this region was not limited by water. Because NPP predictions were closely keyed to forest cover type, the relative coverage of low- versus high-productivity forests at both fine and coarse resolutions was an important determinant of regional NPP predictions. Therefore, changes in grid cell size and differences in the methods used to aggregate from fine to coarse resolution were important to NPP predictions insofar as they changed the relative proportions of forest cover. We suggest that because the small patches of high-elevation spruce-fir forest in this region are substantially less productive than forests in the remainder of the region, more accurate NPP predictions will result if models applied to this region use land cover input data sets that retain as much fine-resolution forest type variability as possible. The differences among model responses to variations in climate and soil WHC data sets suggest that the models will respond quite differently to scenarios of future climate. A better understanding of the dynamic interactions between water stress, N availability, and forest productivity in this region will enable models to make more accurate predictions of future carbon stocks and fluxes.","Climate; Ecosystem process modeling; Modeling uncertainty; Net primary production; Northeastern US; PnET; Soil water holding capacity; Spatial resolution; TEM; Vegetation representation",,,,,,,"Aber, J.D., Driscoll, C.T., Effects of land use, climate variation and N deposition on N cycling and C storage in northern hardwood forests (1997) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 11, pp. 639-648; Aber, J.D., Federer, C.A., A generalized, lumped-parameter model of photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and net primary production in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems (1992) Oecologia, 92, pp. 463-474; Aber, J.D., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Steudler, P., Melillo, J.M., Nitrogen saturation in northern forest ecosystems (1989) BioScience, 39, pp. 378-386; Aber, J.D., Magill, A., Boone, R., Melillo, J.M., Steudler, P., Bowden, R., Plant and soil responses to chronic nitrogen additions at the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts (1993) Ecol Appl, 3, pp. 156-166; Aber, J.D., Ollinger, S.V., Federer, C.A., Reich, P.B., Goulden, M.L., Kicklighter, D.W., Melillo, J.M., Lathrop R.G., Jr., Predicting the effects of climate change on water yield and forest production in the northeastern US (1995) Climate Res, 5, pp. 207-222; Aber, J.D., Reich, P.B., Goulden, M.L., Extrapolating CO2 exchange to the canopy: A generalized model of photosynthesis validated by eddy correlation (1996) Oecologia, 106, pp. 257-265; Aber, J.D., Ollinger, S.V., Driscoll, C.T., Modeling nitrogen saturation in forest ecosystems in response to land use and atmospheric deposition (1997) Ecol Modelling, 101, pp. 61-78; Aber, J.D., McDowell, W., Nadelhoffer, K., Magill, A., Berntson, G., Kamakea, M., McNulty, S., Fernandez, I., Nitrogen saturation in temperate forest ecosystems: Hypotheses revisited (1998) BioScience, 48, pp. 921-934; Beltz, R.C., Cost, N.D., Kingsley, N.P., Peters, J.R., Timber volume distribution maps for the Eastern United States (1992) USDA Forest Service General Technical Report WO-60; Bondeau, A., Kicklighter, D., Kaduk, A., Comparing global models of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP): Importance of vegetation structure on seasonal NPP estimates (1999) Global Change Biol, 5 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 35-45; Bristow, K.L., Campbell, G.S., On the relationship between incoming solar radiation and daily maximum and minimum temperature (1984) Agricul For Meteorol, 31, pp. 159-166; Burke, I.C., Schirnel, D.S., Yonker, C.M., Parton, W.J., Joyce, L.A., Lauenroth, W.K., Regional modeling of grassland biogeochemistry using GIS (1990) Landscape Ecol, 4, pp. 45-54; Burke, I.C., Kittel, T.G.F., Lauenroth, W.K., Snook, P., Yonker, C.M., Parton, W.J., Regional analysis of the central Great Plains: Sensitivity to climate variability (1991) BioScience, 41, pp. 685-692; Burke, I.C., Lauenroth, W.K., Parton, W.J., Regional and temporal variation in net primary production and nitrogen mineralization in grasslands (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1330-1340; Cao, M., Woodward, F.I., Dynamic responses of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling to global climate change (1998) Nature, 393, pp. 249-252; Churkina, G., Running, S., Schloss, A., Comparing global models of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP): The importance of water availability (1999) Global Change Biol, 5 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 46-55; Cramer, W., Kicklighter, D., Bondeau, A., Moore, B.I., Churkina, G., Nemry, B., Ruimy, A., Schloss, A., Comparing global models of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP): Overview and key results (1999) Global Change Biol, 5 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 1-15; Cronon, W., (1983) Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England, , New York: Hill and Wang; Daly, C., Neilson, R.P., Phillips, D.L., A statistical-topographical model for mapping climatological precipitation over mountainous terrain (1994) J Appl Meteorol, 33, pp. 140-158; Field, C., Mooney, H.A., The photosynthesis-nitrogen relationships in wild plants (1986) On the Economy of Plant Form and Function, pp. 25-55. , Givnish T, editor.
