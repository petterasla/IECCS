Changes in mass, volume, area and length of glaciers are reported, but an up-to-date regional assessment of glacier changes is lacking. In the present study, satellite data, maps and ground-based measurements have been used to obtain the snout retreat and surface changes of the Tipra Glacier in the Alaknanda river basin of the Garhwal Himalaya for the period 1962-2008. The study reveals that a large part of the glacier has been detached from the main trunk and separated into the Tipra (7.5 km2) and Rataban (7.4 km2) Glaciers as it had one outlet (snout) in 1987. Between 1962 and 2002 estimated surface area reduced by ~18% and snout retreat was ~535 m with an average rate of 13.4 m a-1. Measurement of snout positions of the Tipra and Rataban Glaciers from 2002 to 2008 indicates an enhanced annual retreat of 21.3 and 21.2 m a-1, respectively. Total frontal area vacated during this period was calculated to be 0.084 km2 for Tipra Glacier and 0.028 km2 for Rataban Glacier. The estimated Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) rise was 76 m for the Tipra Glacier and 57 m for the Rataban Glacier. Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) was calculated as 0.47 for the Tipra Glacier and 0.49 for the Rataban Glacier, during the study period. The observations compared with the other studies carried out in the region show a significant reduction in glacier areas. The increased retreat rate of glacier snouts is probably a direct consequence of global warming. The present snouts of the Tipra and Rataban Glaciers are located at altitudes of 3865 and 4120 m, respectively. © The Author(s) 2011.","climate change; ELA; glacial change; Himalayan glaciers; snout retreat","climate change; geological mapping; glacier retreat; satellite data; volume change; Alaknanda River; Garhwal Himalayas; Himalayas; India; Uttarakhand",,,,,,"Ageta, Y., Higuchi, K., Estimation of mass balance components of a summer-accumulation type glacier in the Nepal Himalaya (1984) Geografiska Annaler, 66 A (3), pp. 249-255; Andrews, J.T., (1975) Glacial Systems, , North Scituate, MA: Duxbury Press; Armstrong, R., Alford, D., Racoviteanu, A., (2009) Water Storage: A Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation in the Himalayas, pp. 14-16. , Kathmandu: ICIMOD; Bajracharya, S.R., Mool, P.K., Shrestha, B.R., (2007) Impact of Climate Change on Himalayan Glaciers and Glacial Lakes: Case Studies on GLOF and Associated Hazards in Nepal and Bhutan, p. 119. , Kathmandu: International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) Publication; Benn, D.I., Lehmkuhl, F., Mass balance and equilibrium line altitude of glaciers in high mountain environments (2000) Quaternary International, 66 (65), pp. 15-29; Benn, D.I., Owen, L.A., Osmaston, H.A., Seltzer, G.O., Porter, C.S., Mark, B., Reconstruction of equilibrium-line altitudes for tropical and sub-tropical glaciers (2005) Quaternary International, 138-139, pp. 8-21; Berthier, E., Arnaund, Y., Kumar, R., Sarfaraz, A., Wagnon, P., Chevallier, P., Remote sensing estimates of glacier mass balances in the Himachal Pradesh (Western Himalaya, India) (2007) Journal of Remote Sensing of the Environment, 108, pp. 327-338; Bhambri, R., Bolch, T., Glacier mapping: A review with special reference to the Indian Himalayas (2009) Progress in Physical Geography, 33 (5), pp. 672-704; Bhutiyani, M.R., Vishwas, S.K., Pawar, N.J., Long-term trends in maximum, minimum and mean annual air temperatures across the Northwestern Himalaya during the twentieth century (2007) Climate Change, 85, pp. 159-177; Borgaonkar, H.P., Pant, G.B., Rupa Kumar, K., Ringwidth variation in Cedrus deodara and its climatic response over the Western Himalaya (1996) International Journal of Climatology, 16, pp. 1409-1422; Bryan, G.M., Geoffrey, O.S., Evolution of recent glacier recession in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru (AD1962-1999): Spatial distribution of mass loss and climatic forcing (2005) Quaternary Science Reviews, 24, pp. 2265-2280; Charlesworth, J.K., (1957) In the Quaternary Era, , London: Edward Arnold; Clark, D.H., Clark, M.M., Gillespie, A.R., Debris-covered glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, California, and their implications for snowline reconstructions (1994) Quaternary Research, 41, pp. 139-153; Cogley, J.G., Kargel, J.S., Kaser, G., van der Veen, C.J., Tracking the source of glacier misinformation (2010) Science, 327, p. 522; Dimri, A.P., Mohanty, U.C., Location specific prediction of maximum and minimum temperature over the Western Himalayas (2007) Meteorological Applications, 14, pp. 79-93; Dobhal, D.P., Mehta, M., Surface morphology elevation changes and terminus retreat of Dokriani glacier, Garhwal Himalaya: Implication of climate change (2010) Himalayan Geology, 31 (1), pp. 71-78; Dobhal, D.P., Gergan, J.T., Thayyen, R.J., Recession and morphometrical change of Dokriani Glacier (1962-1995), Garhwal Himalaya, India (2004) Current Science, 86 (5), pp. 692-696; Dobhal, D.P., Gergan, J.T., Thayyen, R.J., Mass balance studies of Dokriani glacier from 1992 to 2000, Garhwal Himalaya, India (2008) Bulletin of Glaciological Research, Japanese Society of Snow and Ice, 25, pp. 9-17; Dobhal, D.P., Kumar, S., Mundepi, A.K., Morphology and glacier dynamics studies in Monsoon arid transition zone: An example from Chhota Shigri glacier, Himachal Himalaya (1995) India Current Science, 68 (9), pp. 936-944; Gautam, C.K., Mukherjee, B.P., Mass balance vis-à-vis snout position of Tipra Bank Glacier, district Chamoli, U.P (1989) Proceedings of the National Meet on Himalayan Glaciology, New Delhi, pp. 141-148; (1999) A Contribution to the International Hydrological Program, p. 165. , Kaul MK, ed, Geological Survey of India, Special Publication; Haeberli, W., Zemp, M., Hoelzle, M., Frauenfelder, R., Hoelzle, M., Kaab, A., (2005) Fluctuations of Glaciers 1995-2000, 8; Hewitt, K., The Karakoram anomaly?
