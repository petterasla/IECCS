The advantage of the adaptive filter over traditional parametric methods is that it is less affected by seasonal patterns and trends. The filter has been applied to upper-air relative humidity and temperature data. The accuracy of locating the time at which a bias is introduced ranges from about 600 days for changes of 0.1 standard deviations to about 20 days for changes of 0.5 standard deviations.",,"atmospheric instrument; bias; filter; humidity; temperature data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08948755,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030377399
