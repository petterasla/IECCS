This determines the top urgency of studies and quantitative assessments of the internally forced variability of the climate system, without which the ""filtering-out' of anthropogenic impacts on climate cannot be reliable. Such insufficiently studied factors of climate formation as ocean-atmosphere and cloud-radiation interactions are the most substantial aspects of the internal variability. -from Author",,"anthropogenic impact; climate change; global warming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01876236,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026302244
