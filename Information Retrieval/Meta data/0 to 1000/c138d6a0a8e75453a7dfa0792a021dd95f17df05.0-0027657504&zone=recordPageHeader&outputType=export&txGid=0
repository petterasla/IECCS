The Programme is currently examining, on a common basis, the options available for capturing and disposing of the CO2 produced from a range of fossil fuel fired power generation plant types, each with an output of 500MW(e). The options available for disposing of large quantities of CO2 are reviewed and compared on the basis of current knowledge, and the global potential of the options estimated. Photosynthetic processes, such as forestry and biomass production, which remove CO2 from the atmosphere are also included. The long term fate of the CO2, in terms of its eventual re-entry into the atmosphere, is discussed and the disposal options chosen for further study, under the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme, are identified. © 1993.","CO2 Disposal; CO2 Storage; Greenhouse Gases; IEA; Photosynthetic CO2 Fixation","Biomass; Boiler firing; Climatology; Disposability; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Ocean dumping; Photosynthesis; Storage (materials); Carbon dioxide disposal; Carbon dioxide storage; Cost effectiveness; IEA Greenhouse Gas R and D Programme; International Energy Agency (IEA); Large scale disposal; Ocean disposal; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Alpert, Spencer, Hidy, Biospheric Options For Mitigating Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Levels (1992) Energy Convers.
