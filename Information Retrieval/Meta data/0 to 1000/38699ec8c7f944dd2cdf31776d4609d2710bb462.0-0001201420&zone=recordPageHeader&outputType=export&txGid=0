The HA-1 strain, identified as genus Chlorella, was newly isolated from a paddy field by an enrichment culture using reproduced stack gases from a thermal power plant with a concentration of CO2 and O2 of 15% and 2% respectively. It showed maximum growth at 10% CO2 enriched air flowing condition, and showed a good growth rate in a broad range of physically controllable conditions, including CO2 enriched air flow rate, temperature and pH value. The results indicated the feasibility of the HA-1 strain for mass cultivation using stack gases. © 1992.","Chlorella; CO2; CO2 fixation; Global warming; microalgae; single cell protein",,,,,,,"Akiyama, Hirose, Yamagishi, Hirano, Class Chlorophycease (1977) Illustrations of the Japanese fresh-water algae, pp. 275-760. , H.
