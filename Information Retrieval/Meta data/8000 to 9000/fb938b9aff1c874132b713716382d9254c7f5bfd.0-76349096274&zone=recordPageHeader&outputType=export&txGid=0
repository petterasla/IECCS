A section at Bryce Burn in Southland, South Island, provides a record of middle Miocene global cooling associated with buildup of an extensive semi-permanent ice sheet on Antarctica. The section yielded δ180, δ13C, lithological, clay mineral, foraminiferal, and pol-len data that have been linked to a high-resolution age model based on magnetostratigraphy and foraminiferal dating. The sequence exhibits evidence for a δ18O c. 0.6%o positive base-line shift consistent with the age and magnitude of the E3/ Mi3 isotope excursion around 13.9 Ma, carbon maxima 4-6 δ13C excursions, probable orbitally controlled changes in clay mineralogy, and short-term changes in terrestrial vegetation. This is the first time these stable isotopic events have been recognised in outcrop sequences in New Zealand. There ap-pears to be no clear, long-term shift in the data associated with middle Miocene oceanic cooling, apart from the stable isotope evidence, though Milankovitch-scale, short-term fluctuations are present.","Antarctic cooling; Bryce burn; Carbon; Clays; Clifden; Cyclostratigraphy; Foraminifera; Gamma ray; Grain size; Isotopes; Magnetostratigraphy; Oxygen; Paleoceanography; Pollen; Spores","carbon isotope; cyclostratigraphy; foraminifera; ice sheet; magnetostratigraphy; Milankovitch cycle; Miocene; oxygen isotope; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; stable isotope; Antarctica; New Zealand; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Southwest); Foraminifera; Pyrus",,,,,,"Allan, H.H., Flora of New Zealand (1961) Indigenous Tracheophyta, 1, 1085p. , Wellington, Government Printer; Beveridge, A.E., Kauri forests in the New Hebrides (1975) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society London, B272, pp. 369-383; Billups, K., Schrag, D.P., Paleotemperatures and ice volume of the past 27 Myr revisited with paired Mg/Ca and180/160 measurements on benthic foraminifera (2002) Paleoceanography, 17, pp. 1-10; Biscaye, P.E., Mineralogy and sedimentation of recent deep-sea clay in the Atlantic ocean and adjacent sea and oceans (1965) Geological Society of America Bulletin, 76, pp. 803-831; Brown, G., Brindley, G.W., X-ray diffraction procedures for clay mineral identification.
