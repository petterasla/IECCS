Black carbon (BC) materials are among the slowest decomposing components of the SOC pool. Although BC is a large component of SOC in many systems, the influence of temperature on decomposition of BC bearing different chemical and physical structures remains poorly understood. Four BC materials, produced by carbonizing corn residue and oak wood at 350 and 600 °C (corn-350-BC, corn-600-BC, oak-350-BC, and oak-600-BC), were mixed with pure sand and incubated at 4, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 °C for 1 year. Corn-BC was more porous than oak-BC as determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Increasing the charring temperature from 350 to 600 °C led to greater aromaticity with 5-15% more C in aromatic rings and a 39-57% increase in both nonprotonated aromatic C and aromatic bridgehead C quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and a greater degree of order and development of C layers as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). With a temperature increase from 4 to 60 °C, C loss of corn-350-BC increased from 10 to 20%, corn-600-BC, from 4 to 20%, oak-350-BC, from 2.3 to 15%, and oak-600-BC from 1.5 to 14% of initial C content, respectively. Temperature sensitivity (Q10) decreased with increasing incubation temperature and was highest in oak-600-BC, followed by oak-350-BC, corn-600-BC, and corn-350-BC, indicating that decomposition of more stable BC was more sensitive to increased temperature than less stable materials. Carbon loss and potential cation exchange capacity (CECp) significantly (p &lt; 0.05) correlated with O/C ratios and change in O/C ratios, suggesting that oxidative processes were the most important mechanism controlling BC decomposition in this study. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Aromatic rings; Aromaticities; Black carbon; Carbon loss; Cation exchange capacities; Corn residues; Degree of order; Increased temperature; Incubation temperatures; Large components; Oak wood; Oxidative process; Physical structures; SEM; Soil organic carbon; TEM; Temperature increase; Temperature sensitivity; Aromatic compounds; Global warming; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Organic carbon; Resonance; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; Decomposition; black carbon; nanomaterial; organic carbon; oxygen; soil organic matter; carbon; cation exchange capacity; decomposition; global warming; organic carbon; scanning electron microscopy; sensitivity analysis; soil carbon; temperature effect; transmission electron microscopy; woody debris; aerobic metabolism; article; chemical structure; controlled study; correlation analysis; decomposition; incubation temperature; nuclear magnetic resonance; oxidation kinetics; scanning electron microscopy; sensitivity analysis; temperature measurement; temperature sensitivity; transmission electron microscopy; Biomass; Carbon; Cations; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Nanotechnology; Oxygen; Soil; Soot; Temperature; Time Factors; Wood; Zea mays; Zea mays",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Cations; Oxygen, 7782-44-7; Soil; Soot",,,,"Agren, G.I., Temperature dependence of old soil organic matter (2000) Ambio, 29, pp. 55-55; Knorr, W., Prentice, I.C., House, J.I., Holland, E.A., Long-term sensitivity of soil carbon turnover to warming (2005) Nature, 433, pp. 298-301; Davidson, E.A., Janssens, I.A., Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change (2006) Nature, 440, pp. 165-173; Reichstein, M., Kätterer, T., Andren, O., Ciais, P., Schulze, E.D., Cramer, W., Papale, D., Valentini, R., Does the temperature sensitivity of decomposition of soil organic matter depend upon water content, soil horizon, or incubation time (2005) Biogeosciences, 2, pp. 317-321; Liski, J., Ilvesniemi, H., Makela, A., Westman, C.J., CO2 emissions from soil in response to climatic warming are overestimated - The decomposition of old soil organic matter is tolerant of temperature (1999) Ambio, 28, pp. 171-174; Giardina, C.P., Ryan, M.G., Evidence that decomposition rates of organic carbon in mineral soil do not vary with temperature (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 858-861; Schmidt, M.W.I., Skjemstad, J.O., Gehrt, E., Kögel-Knabner, I., Charred organic carbon in German chernozemic soils (1999) Eur.
