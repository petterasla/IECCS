Box 71, H-8361 Keszthely, Hungary","The influences of global climate change on sensible and latent heat fluxes of maize were studied by using the simulation model of Goudriaan (1977). Eight scenarios were made, an increase of CO2 content until doubling the recent content was included in the scenarios. Some of the scenarios were developed by downscaling the IPCC (2007) report (A2 and B2) to Hungary, and the others by taking into account more serious weather changes. Surprisingly, the distribution of intercepted radiation among sensible and latent heat fluxes in the individual scenarios was not significantly modified. A given increase in ambient air temperature caused a lesser rise in crop temperature at cob level, demonstrating the compensation role of the canopy. The moderate rise in crop temperature indicated that the plants did not suffer significantly from lack of water in any of the scenarios. However, there was a variation during the diurnal cycle. The doubled CO2 concentration alone increased the net carbon assimilation rate of maize by 40%. Photosynthesis decreased only in cases with warmings higher than 6 °C. Decreased precipitation counteracted the positive influence of elevated CO2 on carbon assimilation. In other scenarios the latent heat flux increased in comparison to control run. This justifies the existence of reserve soil water at Keszthely, even in on extra hot day during July.","Global warming; Maize canopy; Micro-meteorological model; Simulation","air temperature; ambient air; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; crop production; downscaling; global climate; latent heat flux; maize; photosynthesis; sensible heat flux; soil water; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Hungary; Zea mays",,,,,,"Anda, A., Modeling maize response to climate modification in Hungary (2006) Commun.
