The focus of this paper is to summarize the key processes and features that characterize the major coastal LMEs of the Pacific, as part of a greater effort to understand the role of past and future global climate change in driving (possibly synchronous) fluctuations in marine populations. The physical setting of five LMEs - the Humboldt Current System (HCS), California Current System (CCS), Gulf of Alaska (GOA), Kuroshio Current System (KCS), and Oyashio Current System (OCS) - and the mechanisms and impacts of climate variability on these systems are described. Because of their pivotal role in linking and perhaps synchronizing climate variability in disparate LMEs, we also review teleconnections and analyze past global atmospheric teleconnections and regional ocean response patterns. The major Pacific eastern boundary current systems, the CCS and HCS, feature similar dominant processes (e.g., coastal upwelling), and share atmospheric forcing from common teleconnection patterns that vary together. Sea level pressure variations forcing the KCS and OCS systems on climate scales, however, are not strongly teleconnected to the CCS and HCS. A common factor analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) within these ecosystems provides an example of how LMEs have responded to past climate variability. All LMEs display a persistent warming tendency since 1900, with multi-decadal fluctuations superimposed. However, SST fluctuations in the western Pacific lag those in the east by about a decade. Global synchrony in climate forcing is modulated by distinct processes within each LME, which reduce the correlation between long-term fluctuations.","Climate change; Marine ecosystems; Pacific Ocean; Teleconnections","Atmospheric forcing; Atmospheric teleconnections; California current systems; Climate change impact; Climate forcings; Climate variability; Coastal upwelling; Common factors; Current system; Dominant process; Global climate changes; Global climates; Gulf of Alaska; Humboldt current system; Key process; Kuroshio current system; Large marine ecosystem; Marine ecosystem; Ocean process; Ocean response; Pacific Eastern Boundary Current; Pacific ocean; Sea level pressure; Sea surface temperatures; Teleconnection patterns; Teleconnections; Western Pacific; Atmospheric temperature; Ecosystems; Ocean currents; Sea level; Submarine geophysics; Climate change; atmospheric forcing; climate change; climate forcing; climate variation; marine ecosystem; sea surface temperature; teleconnection; Pacific Ocean",,,,,,"Alexander, M.A., Bladé, I., Newman, M., Lanzante, J.R., Lau, N.-C., Scott, J.D., The atmospheric bridge: the influence of ENSO teleconnections on air-sea interaction over the global oceans (2002) J.
