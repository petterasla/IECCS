These responses include the decrease in convective mass fluxes, the increase in horizontal moisture transport, the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and its temporal variance, and the decrease in the horizontal sensible heat transport in the extratropics. A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Evaporation; Hydrology; Moisture; Precipitation (meteorology); Transport properties; Convective mass fluxes; Extratropics; Hydrological cycle; Global warming; climate change; convective system; evaporation; global warming; heat transfer; hydrological cycle; moisture transfer; water vapor",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Ingram, W.J., Constraints on future changes in the hydrological cycle (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 224-228; Betts, A.K., Climate-convection feedbacks: Some further issues (1998) Climatic Change, 39, pp. 35-38; Boer, G.J., Climate change and the regulation of the surface moisture and energy budgets (1993) Climate Dyn., 8, pp. 225-239; Bosilovich, M.G., Schubert, S.D., Walker, G.K., Global changes in water cycle intensity (2005) J.
