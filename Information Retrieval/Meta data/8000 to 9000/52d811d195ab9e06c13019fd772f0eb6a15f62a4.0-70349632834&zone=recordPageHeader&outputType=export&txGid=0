This study provides a life-cycle energy analysis for CMOS chips over 7 technology generations with the purpose of comparing energy demand and global warming potential (GWP) impacts of the life-cycle stages, examining trends in these impacts over time and evaluating their sensitivity to data uncertainty and changes in production metrics such as yield. A hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) model is used. While life-cycle energy and GWP of emissions have increased on the basis of a wafer or die, these impacts have been reducing per unit of computational power. Sensitivity analysis of the model shows that impacts have the highest relative sensitivity to wafer yield, line yield, and die size and largest absolute sensitivity to the use-phase power demand of the chip. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"CMOS chips; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Computational logic; Computational power; Data uncertainty; Die size; Energy analysis; Energy demands; Global warming potential; IT networks; Life cycle stages; Life-cycle assessments; Per unit; Power demands; Production metrics; Relative sensitivity; Semiconductor chips; Transistor structure; Wafer yields; Wireless devices; Computer networks; Dies; Energy management; Global warming; Life cycle; Metallic compounds; MOS devices; Personal computers; Semiconductor devices; Silicon wafers; Uncertainty analysis; Sensitivity analysis; metal oxide; electronic equipment; energy use; global warming; life cycle analysis; sensitivity analysis; article; computer analysis; energy expenditure; greenhouse effect; life cycle; logic; semiconductor; sensitivity analysis; Computers; Conservation of Energy Resources; Electric Power Supplies; Greenhouse Effect; Industry; Semiconductors",,,,,,"Toffel, M.W., Horvath, A., Environmental implications of wireless technologies: News delivery and business meetings (2004) Environmental Science and Technology, 38 (11), pp. 2961-2970. , DOI 10.1021/es035035o; Kim, J., Xu, M., Kahhat, R., Allenby, B., Williams, E., Designing and Assessing a Sustainable Networked Delivery (SND) System: Hybrid Business-to-Consumer Book Delivery Case Study (2009) Environ.
