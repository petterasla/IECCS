The new fluorocarbon radical source was designed to generate fluorocarbon reactive species from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) by CO2 laser ablation. An electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) O2 plasma equipped with the fluorocarbon radical source has been applied to amorphous silicon (a-Si) and tungsten (W) etchings for chamber cleaning process after chemical vapor deposition (CVD). As a result, the etchings of a-Si and W were successfully demonstrated. These results indicate this process is potentially applied to the chamber cleaning process keeping harmony with the environment, particularly for preventing global warming. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
