This analysis is done in climate models driven by observed sea surface temperatures [Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) runs], preindustrial runs of fully coupled climate models, and in two reanalysis products, the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and the NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). The water vapor feedback during ENSO-driven climate variations in the AMIP models ranges from 1.9 to 3.7 W m-2 K-1, in the control runs it ranges from 1.4 to 3.9 W m-2 K-1, and in the ERA-40 and MERRA it is 3.7 and 4.7 W m-2 K-1, respectively. Taken as a group, these values are higher than previous estimates of the water vapor feedback in response to century-long global warming. Also examined is the reason for the large spread in the ENSO-driven water vapor feedback among the models and between the models and the reanalyses. The models and the reanalyses show a consistent relationship between the variations in the tropical surface temperature over an ENSO cycle and the radiative response to the associated changes in specific humidity. However, the feedback is defined as the ratio of the radiative response to the change in the global average temperature. Differences in extratropical temperatures will, therefore, lead to different inferred feedbacks, and this is the root cause of spread in feedbacks observed here. This is also the likely reason that the feedback inferred from ENSO is larger than for long-term global warming. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric model intercomparison projects; Average temperature; Climate model; Climate variation; ENSO cycle; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts; Extratropical; Fully-coupled; Pre-industrial; Reanalysis; Research and application; Root cause; Sea surface temperatures; Southern Oscillation; Specific humidity; Surface temperatures; Water vapor feedbacks; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Feedback; Global warming; Moisture; NASA; Nickel compounds; Surface properties; Water vapor; Weather forecasting; Climate models; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate feedback; climate modeling; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; estimation method; global warming; humidity; sea surface temperature; troposphere; water vapor",,,,,,"Colman, R., A comparison of climate feedbacks in general circulation models (2003) Climate Dyn., 20, pp. 865-873; Dessler, A.E., Sherwood, S.C., A matter of humidity (2009) Science, 323, pp. 1020-1021; Dessler, A.E., Yang, P., Zhang, Z., Water-vapor climate feedback inferred from climate fluctuations, 2003-2008 (2008) Geophys.
