This article examines the potential sensitivity of water resources in the UK to climatic change as exemplified by the 1988-92 drought. the representation of hydrological processes at three distinct model scales is then discussed with reference to global hydrology, regional downscaling and catchment-scale responses. A final section speculates on future directions of research for an emerging greenhouse hydrology. -Author",,"climate change; drought (1988-92); hydrological process; scale response; water resource; Global Warming; Hydrology; UK; Water Resources",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029413805
