The use of a germplasm with an early-morning flowering (EMF) trait has been hypothesized as a way of avoiding this problem. In this study, the effect of the EMF trait on avoiding high temperature-induced sterility at anthesis by flowering at a cooler temperature in the early morning was evaluated.MethodsThe EMF trait was introgressed from wild rice (Oryza officinalis) into the rice cultivar 'Koshihikari' (O. sativa). First, spikelets of the EMF line and Koshihikari were subjected to rising temperatures during the daytime in the greenhouse to test for differences in spikelet sterility. Secondly, spikelets of both plants were exposed to 26, 34 and 38 °C at anthesis and to 38 °C beginning at least 1 h after flowering, in the growth chambers at 70 relative humidity, to test for differences in tolerance to high temperatures.Key ResultsSpikelets of the EMF line started and completed flowering a few hours earlier than Koshihikari. In a greenhouse experiment, spikelets of Koshihikari opened after the air temperature reached 35 °C, but those of the EMF line could open at cooler temperatures. Under these conditions, spikelet sterility significantly increased in Koshihikari, but did not in the EMF line. The number of sterile spikelets increased as their flowering time was delayed in Koshihikari. Furthermore, the chamber experiments revealed that 60 of the spikelets from both lines were sterile when exposed to 38 °C at anthesis, indicating that tolerance of high temperature was similar in both genotypes.ConclusionsReduced sterility in the EMF line subjected to rising temperatures at anthesis in the greenhouse was attributed to an earlier flowering time compared with Koshihikari. The EMF trait of wild rice is effective in mitigating anticipated yield loss due to global warming by escaping high-temperature stress at anthesis during the daytime. © The Author 2010.","Early-morning flowering; high-temperature stress; Oryza officinalis; Oryza sativa; rice; spikelet sterility; wild rice","air temperature; cultivar; evolutionarily stable strategy; flowering; genetic resource; genotype; germplasm; global warming; greenhouse ecosystem; high temperature; life history trait; relative humidity; rice; sterility; temperature tolerance; yield response; adaptation; article; genetics; heat; physiology; rice; Adaptation, Physiological; Hot Temperature; Oryza sativa; Oryza officinalis; Oryza sativa; Zizania",,,,,,"Baker, J.T., Allen, L.H., Boote, K.J., Temperature effects on rice at elevated CO2 concentration (1992) Journal of Experimental Botany, 43, pp. 959-964; Hasegawa, T., Yoshimoto, M., Kuwagata, T., Ishigooka, Y., Kondo Ishimaru M, T., The impact of global warming on rice production: Lessons from spikelet sterility observed under the record hot summer of 2007 (2009) NIAES Annual Report 2008, pp. 23-25; Horie, T., Predicting the effects of climatic variation and elevated CO2 on rice yield in Japan (1993) Journal of Agricultural Metrology, 48, pp. 567-574; (2007) 4th Assessment Report, 'Impacts, Adaptation and Valnerability', , http://www.ipcc-wg2.org/, Working Group II. 7 October 2007; Jagadish, S.V.K., Craufurd, P.Q., Wheeler, T.R., High temperature stress and spikelet fertility in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
