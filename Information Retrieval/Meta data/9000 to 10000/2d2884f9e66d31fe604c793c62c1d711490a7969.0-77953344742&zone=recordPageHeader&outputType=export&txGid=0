Nevertheless, Alpine glaciers are more sensitive to climate warming, and climate warming has seriously affected Alpine glaciers and surrounding environment. The quality and attractiveness of Alpine glaciers to tourism has been and will continue to be diminished with tourists' visitation and local economic development. At present, it has become a primary problem that Alpine glacier tourism adapts to climate warming. Based on this reason, the purpose of this article is to take Baishui (chinese source) Glacier No. 1 as an example to outline the possible impacts of climate warming on Alpine glacier tourism and put forward some adaptive measures and strategies aligned with climate warming. Specific measures are as follows: (1) optimize the space layout of glacier tourism area; (2) improve glacier tourism and environmental protection planning; (3) adopt multidimensional protective measures; (4) strengthen scientific research of glacier and environment protection; (5) develop glacier tourism products by multi-directions; (6) integrate regional tourism resources; (7) reinforce public environmental education. © 2010 China University of Geosciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alpine glacier; Baishui Glacier No. 1; Global warming; Impact and adaptation","adaptive management; climate change; economic development; environmental education; environmental planning; environmental protection; glacial landform; global warming; tourism market; China; Yulong Snow Mountains; Yunnan",,,,,,"Amelung, B., Nicholls, S., Viner, D., Implications of Global Climate for Tourism Flows and Seasonality (2007) Journal of Travel Research, 45, p. 285; Bardsley, D.K., Edwards-Jones, G., Invasive Species Policy and Climate Change: Social Perceptions of Environmental Change in the Mediterranean (2007) Environmental Science & Policy, 10 (3), pp. 230-242; Becken, S., Harmonising Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation: The Case of Tourist Resorts in Fiji (2005) Global Environmental Change, 15 (4), pp. 381-393; Bera, S.K., Basumatary, S.K., Conversion of Forest Land in Garo Hills, Meghalaya for Construction of Roads: A Threat to the Environment and Biodiversity (2006) Current Science, 91 (3), p. 281; Berthier, E., Arnaud, Y., Kumar, R., Remote Sensing Estimates of Glacier Mass Balances in the Himachal Pradesh (Western Himalaya, India) (2007) Remote Sensing of Environment, 108, pp. 327-338; Carey, M., Living and Dying with Glaciers: People's Historical Vulnerability to Avalanches and Outburst Floods in Peru (2005) Global and Planetary Change, 47 (2-4), pp. 122-134; Cecil, L.D.W., Green, J.R., Thompson, L.G., (2004) In Earth Paleoenvironments: Records Preserved in Mid and Low-Latitude Glaciers, pp. 3-15. , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Dyurgerov, M.B., Meier, M.F., (2005) Glaciers and the Changing Earth System: A 2004 Snapshot, p. 58. , Colorado: Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research; Elsasser, H., Burki, R., Climate Change as a Threat to Tourism in the Alps (2002) Climate Research, 20, pp. 253-257; Gössling, S., Global Environmental Consequences of Tourism (2002) Global Environmental Change, 12 (4), pp. 283-302; Gössling, S., Hall, C.M., (2006) An Introduction to Tourism and Global Environmental Change, p. 134. , London: Routledge; Haeberli, W., (2005) Mountain Glaciers in Global Climate-Related Observing Systems, Global Change and Mountain Regions, pp. 169-175. , Netherlands: Springer; He, Y.Q., Li, Z.X., Yang, X.M., Changes of the Hailuogou Glacier, Mt.
