In the present study, long-term trends in the phytoplankton community structure under the influence of nuclear power plant thermal effluent in the subtropical Daya Bay (DYB) in China were investigated in the summer season from 1982 to 2005. Water temperature at the outfall station was significantly higher than in the surrounding water, by as much as 5.6°C, and increased by 6.8°C during the 23 yr study period. The contribution of diatoms and dinoflagellates to the total phytoplankton showed significant correlation with temperature (R2&gt; 0.65), negative for diatoms, while positive for dinoflagellates. Although dinoflagellate abundance increased over time at both the outfall and adjacent (control) stations, the increase at the outfall station was much more dramatic and accelerated over time. No clear relationship between the phytoplankton shift and stratification was evident. When water temperature reached 35°C or&gt;3.7°C above that at the control station, dinoflagellates, such as Ceratium furca, C. fusus, C. trichoceros, Dinophysis caudate and Protoperidinium depressum, grew to prominence, accounting for about 50% of the total phytoplankton abundance. On the contrary, the diatom contribution decreased during the study period, from 82.0% in 1982 to 53.1% in 2005. These results suggest that the rise in temperature caused by power plant thermal discharge has imposed strong influences on the phytoplankton community, favoring dinoflagellates over diatoms, with a remarkable diatom to dinoflagellate shift when temperature increases to a threshold level of 35°C or reaches a threshold differential of 3.7°C relative to the normal ambient temperature in DYB. © Inter-Research 2011.","Daya Bay; Ecological effects; Nuclear power plant; Phytoplankton; Thermal effluent","abundance; diatom; dinoflagellate; ecological approach; global warming; nuclear power plant; phytoplankton; temperature effect; waste disposal; water temperature; China; Daya Bay; Guangdong; Bacillariophyta; Ceratium furca; Dinophyceae; Dinophysis; Protoperidinium depressum",,,,,,"Alkawri, A.A.S., Ramaiah, N., Spatio-temporal variability of dinoflagellate assemblages in different salinity regimes in the west coast of India (2010) Harmful Algae, 9, pp. 153-162; Beaugrand, G., Brander, K.M., Lindley, J.A., Souissi, S., Reid, P.C., Plankton effect on cod recruitment in the North Sea (2003) Nature, 426 (6967), pp. 661-664. , DOI 10.1038/nature02164; Cai, R.S., Zhang, Q.L., Qi, Q.H., Spatial and temporal oscillation and long-term variation in sea surface temperature field of South China Sea (2009) J Oceanogr Taiwan, 28, pp. 559-568. , in Chinese, with English abstract; Chen, C., Shi, P., Mao, Q.W., Satellite remote sensing survey of chlorophyll concentration of surface waters in Daya Bay (1996) Sustainable Utilization of Oceanic Bioresources at Daya Bay, pp. 56-59. , In Zuo RL (ed), Science Press, Beijing, in Chinese; Curtiss, C.C., Langlois, G.W., Busse, L.B., Mazzillo, F., Silver, M.W., The emergence of Cochlodinium along the California coast (USA) (2008) Harmful Algae, 7, pp. 337-346; Descy, J.P., Mouvet, C., Impact of the Tihange nuclear power plant on the periphyton and the phytoplankton of the Meuse River ( Belgium).
