These findings raise significant questions about the oft-reported claim that CO2-induced global warming will lead to an increase in world storminess. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,"Agee, E.M., Trends in cyclone and anticyclone frequency and comparison with periods of warming and cooling over the Northern Hemisphere (1991) Journal of Climate, 4, pp. 263-267; The changing atmosphere — challenges and opportunities (1988) Bull.
