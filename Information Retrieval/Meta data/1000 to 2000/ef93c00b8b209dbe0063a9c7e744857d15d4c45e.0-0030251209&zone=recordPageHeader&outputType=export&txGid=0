Cellular uptake of a vital stain, which occurs in living cells only, was halved at -6 ± 1°C for the cultivated CAM species Agave salmiana, Opuntia ficus-indica and Stenocereus queretaroensis growing at day/night air temperatures of 30°C/20°C compared with -12°C for the wild species Opuntia humifusa. When plants were grown at reduced temperatures of 10°C/0°C, stain uptake was halved at about -8°C for the cultivated species but at -24°C for O. humifusa. The greater low-temperature sensitivity and the lesser low-temperature acclimation of the cultivated species severely limit the regions where they can presently be grown, but such regions will expand as air temperatures rise accompanying global climate change. When the atmospheric CO2 concentration was doubled from the current ambient value of 360 μmol mol-1 to 720 μmol mol-1, net CO2 uptake over 24-h periods increased 36% for A. salmiana and S. queretaroensis; about one-third of the increase resulted from higher net CO2 uptake rates in the last 4 h of daytime and two-thirds from higher rates during the first 8 h of the night. The doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration predicted to occur before the end of the twenty-first century will increase CO2 uptake and hence biomass productivity of such CAM species, further expanding the regions where they may be profitably cultivated.","Agave salmiana; CO2 uptake; Crassulacean acid metabolism; global climate change; low temperature; Opuntia ficus-indica; Opuntia humifusa; Stenocereus queretaroensis","carbon dioxide enrichment; climatic charge; crassulacean acid metabolism; freezing tolerance; Agaraceae; Agave salmiana; Cactaceae; Opuntia ficus-indica; Opuntia humifusa; Stenocereus queretaroensis",,,,,,"Adams, R.M., Rosenzweig, C., Peart, R.M., Richie, J.T., McCarl, B.A., Glyer, J.D., Curry, R.B., Allen L.H., Jr., Global climate change and US agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-224; Benson, L., (1982) The Cacti of the United States and Canada, , Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. 1044 pp; Cui, M., Miller, P.M., Nobel, P.S., CO2 exchange and growth of the Crassulacean acid metabolism plant Opuntia ficus-indica under elevated CO2 in open-top chambers (1993) Plant Physiology, 103, pp. 519-524; Didden-Zopfy, B., Nobel, P.S., High temperature tolerance and heat acclimation of Opuntia bigelovii (1982) Oecologia, 52, pp. 176-180; Gentry, H.S., (1982) Agaves of Continental North America, , Tucson, Arizona: University of Arizona Press. 670 pp; Hoagland, D.R., Arnon, D.J., The water-culture method for growing plants without soil (1950) California Agricultural Experiment Station Circular, 347, pp. 1-32; Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, J., (1990) Climate Change.
