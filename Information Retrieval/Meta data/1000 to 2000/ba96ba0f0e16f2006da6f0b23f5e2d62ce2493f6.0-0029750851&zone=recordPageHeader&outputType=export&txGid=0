Surprisingly little research has been devoted to establishing the underlying statistical relationship between human activities and CO2 emissions. This paper explores the nature of the relationship between global population growth and CO2 emissions by employing the test of causality developed by Granger on annual data for 1880-1989, as well as more comprehensive error correction and cointegration models. The results suggest a lack of a long-term equilibrium relationship, but imply a short-term dynamic relationship from CO2 to population growth. -from Authors",,"carbon emission; cointegration analysis; error correction; global warming; Granger causality test; historical perspective; man- environment relations; population growth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029750851
