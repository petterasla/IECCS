Two kinds of environmental loads respecting fossil fuel depletion as input resources to the system and global warming due to CO2 emission as output are taken into account in the present eco-criterion, in which the total eco-load (EcL) value is calculated from the summation of respective environmental load factors on the whole process in a life cycle of the system. This NETS method is applied to eco-management co-generation systems, in which a computer-aided output navigator proceeds the LCA estimation with ICON and Q&amp;A communication. An operation scheme most friendly to the environment with a minimum EcL value, i.e., an eco-operation scheme, is derived from the optimization theory.","Co-generation system; Environmental load; Fossil fuel depletion; Global warning; Life cycle assessment","Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Life cycle; Optimization; Standards; Carbon dioxide emission; Co-generation system; Eco-management; Environmental load; Fossil fuel depletion; Life cycle assessment estimation; Fossil fuels",,,,,,"Steen, B., Ryding, S.O., (1992) The EPS Enviro-Accounting Method: An Application of Environmental Accounting Principles for Evaluation and Valuation of Environmental Impact in Product Design, , Swedish Environmental Research Institute (IVL) Report, Sweden; Houghton, J.T., Calleander, B.A., Varney, S.K., (1992) Climate Change 1992, , The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, Cambridge University Press, UK","Maruyama, N.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; email: naoki@mach.mie-u.ac.jp",,,,,,,,01950738,,JERTD,,"English","J Energy Resour Technol Trans ASME",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035779152
