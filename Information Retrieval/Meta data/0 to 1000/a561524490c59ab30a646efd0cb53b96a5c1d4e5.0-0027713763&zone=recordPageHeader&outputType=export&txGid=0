The prospect of declining take levels due to global climate change in coming decades presents challenges to environmental policy makers concerned with choosing appropriate toxics clean-up methods and timing. It is important to integrate the possibility of declining Iake levels into Great Lakes toxic sediments remediation in order to ensure that long-term environmental policy is not in conflict with the potential regional hydrological impacts of climate change. © 1993.",,"climate change; climatic change; environmental policy; environmental remediation; lake management; policy-making process; remediation action; toxic sediment; North America, Great Lakes",,,,,,"Changnon, Climate change and hydrologic and atmospheric issues (1989) Report of the First US-Canada Symposium on Impacts of Climate Change on the Great Lakes Basin, p. 80. , US National Climate Program Office and Canadian Climate Centre, Joint Report No 1, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Rockville, MD; (1988) Revised Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978, As Amended by Protocol Signed November 18, 1987, , International Joint Commission, (IJC), Article II; Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment (Report of Working Group 1), , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Houghton, Callander, Varney, (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge; Kellogg, Zhao, Sensitivity of soil moisture to doubling of carbon dioxide in climate model experiments Part I North America (1988) Journal of Climate, 1 (4), pp. 348-366; Canadian Climate Program Board, (1991) Climate Change Digest: Climate Change and Canadian Impacts — The Scientific Perspective, , Canadian Climate Centre, Montsview, Ontario, CDD 91-01; Cohen, Impacts of CO2 induced climatic change on water resources in the Great Lakes Basin (1986) Climatic Change, 8 (2), pp. 135-153; Cohen, Climatic change, population growth, and their effects on Great Lakes water supplies (1986) The Professional Geographer, 38 (4), pp. 317-323; Croley, II, Laurentian Great Lakes double-CO2 climate change hydrological impacts (1990) Climatic Change, 17 (1), pp. 27-47; Smith, Tirpak, (1989) The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change on the United States: Report to Congress, , US Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC, EPA-230-05-89-050; (1989) Report of the Great Lakes Science Advisory Board, , For example, International Joint Commission, Hamilton, Ontario; (1989) Fourth Biennial Report Under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978 to the Governments of the United States and Canada and the State and Provincial Governments of the Great Lakes Basin, , Windsor, Ontario; (1989) Living With The Lakes: Challenges and Opportunities: Annex A, Past and Future Water Level Fluctuations, , Windsor, Ontario; Hartmann, Climate change impacts on Laurentian Great Lakes levels (1990) Climatic Change, 17 (1), pp. 49-67; Great Lakes Commission, (1990) A Guidebook to Drought Planning, Management and Water Level Changes in the Great Lakes, p. 48. , Ann Arbor, MI; Report to the Great Lakes Science Advisory Board (1989) Report No 5779s, , International Joint Commission, Hamilton, Ontario, The binational International Joint Commission was created in 1909 to resolve disputes over the water resources shared by Canada and the USA (Treaty Between the United States and Great Britain Relating to Boundary Waters Between the United States and Canada, 11 January 1909, 36 Stat. 2448.
