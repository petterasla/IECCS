Similar to several other arctic regions, the lakes and ponds were slightly alkaline (mean pH = 7.65), dilute (mean specific conductance = 96.4 μS), and low in nutrients. What distinguished this limnological data set was the ultra-oligotrophic nature of the lakes and ponds, as mean phosphorus (1.3 μg 1-1) and chlorophyll a (0.4 μg 1-1) concentrations were amongst the lowest recorded in arctic environments. Also, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (often &lt;1 mg 1-1) were 2-3 times lower than those recorded for ponds at similar latitudes. Principal components analysis (PCA) separated sites primarily along a gradient of DOC and specific conductance, and along a secondary gradient of particulate nitrogen, likely reflecting differences in phyto- and zooplankton biomass. These ultra-oligotrophic lakes and ponds should show a marked response to global warming. As DOC acts as a natural UV radiation screen, the combination of ultra-oligotrophic conditions and low DOC levels suggests that the biota within these sites are representative of those adapted to living in highly stressful environments. Lakes and ponds in this region make ideal monitoring sites, as they should be especially responsive to future environmental changes.","Canada; High Arctic; Limnology; Oligotrophic; Principal components analyses; Water chemistry","Biomass; Carbon; Data acquisition; Ecosystems; Global warming; Nitrogen; Limnology; Lakes; environmental monitoring; lake; limnology; oligotrophic environment; pond; principal component analysis; Canada; cellular organisms; Mus; Victoria",,,,,,"Andreev, A.A., Klimanov, V.A., Quantitative Holocene climatic reconstruction from Arctic Russia (2000) J.
