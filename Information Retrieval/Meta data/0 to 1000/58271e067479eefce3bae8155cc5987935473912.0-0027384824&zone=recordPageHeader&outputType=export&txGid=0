These additions to the model show that the major controls on CO2 concentrations during the Paleozoic era were solar and biological, and not tectonic, in origin. The model predictions agree with independent estimates of a large mid-Paleozoic (400 to 320 million years ago) drop in CO2 concentrations, which led to large-scale glaciation. This agreement indicates that variations in the atmospheric greenhouse effect were important in global climate change during the distant geologic past.",,"atmosphere; carbon dioxide; climate change; Palaeozoic; plant evolution; solar radiation",,,,,,,"Berner, R.A.; Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511, United States",,,,,,,,00368075,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027384824
