The system integration technology for connection of the hydrogen production system to the HTGR is one of the key technologies to put hydrogen production with nuclear energy to commercial use. Research and development on the system integration technology has been carried out for four items: control technology to maintain reactor operation against thermal disturbance caused by the hydrogen production system, estimation of the tritium permeation into the hydrogen from the reactor, a countermeasure against explosion, and development of a high-temperature valve to isolate the reactor and hydrogen production systems in accidents. This report describes the research activities on the system integration technology at JAEA.","High-temperature gas-cooled reactor; Hydrogen production; System integration technology","High temperature reactors; Hydrogen; Nuclear energy; Production; Research and development management; Technology; Tritium; High-temperature gas-cooled reactor; Hydrogen production technology; System integration technology; Gas cooled reactors",,,,,,"Saito, S., ""Design of High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor"" (1994), JAERI-1332, Japan Atomic Energy Research InstituteKubo, S., ""Construction of Apparatus with Thermochemical Hydrogen Production Process"" (2001) Proc. 11th Canadian Hydrogen Conf., , Victoria, Canada, June 17-21, 2001; Onuki, K., ""Thermochemical Hydrogen Production by Iodine-Sulfur Cycle"" (2002) Proc. 14th World Hydrogen Energy Conf., , Montreal, Canada, June 9-13, 2002; Terada, A., ""Development of Hydrogen Production Technology by Thermo-Chemical Water Splitting IS Process - Pilot Test Plan"" (2005) Proc.
