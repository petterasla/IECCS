Increased appreciation of uses and threats is essential to protect wetlands where justified. Three quarters of India's population is rural, it places great demands on India's wetlands and losses continue to occur. This paper is based on extensive discussions with natural resource managers, government employees, farmers, academicians, and resource users at dozens of sites in India, as well as an extensive literature search. Twelve important kinds of wetland loss are identified and mechanisms believed to be causing them discussed: (1) agricultural conversion, (2) direct deforestation, (3) hydrologic alteration, (4) inundation, (5) defoliation, (6) altered upper watersheds, (7) accumulative water demands, (8) water quality degradation, (9) wetland consolidation, (10) global climate change, (11) ground-water depletion, (12) exotic species and biodiversity. Wetland understanding, management, and public awareness in India must continue growing if wetland resources are to remain functional.","Causes; Habitat Degradation; India; Sustainability; Wetland","ground water; agriculture; biodiversity; climate; forest; india; resource management; review; water quality",,,,,,"Abrol, A.P., Yadav, J.S.D., Massoud, F.I., Salt-affected soils and their management (1988) FAO Soils Bulletin, 39, p. 131; Adams, W.A., Akhtar, N., The possible consequences for herbage growth of waterlogging compacted pasture soils (1994) Plant and Soil, 162, pp. 1-17; Agarwal, B., Press, O.U., Rural women, poverty and natural resources: Sustenance sustainability and struggle for change (1992) In: Poverty in India - Research and Policy, Ed.
