We compared the effects of four thermal regimes with a standard day-time temperature of 26°C and the night-time temperature varying from 14 to 26°C by increments of 4°C. Increasing concentrations of chlorogenic acid and tomatine reduced developmental rate linearly. At 26:22°C, there was also a quadratic effect, such that intermediate concentrations had a disproportionately large negative effect. Furthermore, the negative effects of the allelochemicals were less at the 26:14°C regime. These results differ from another study examining a different insect species, which suggests that the response to incremental changes in night-time temperature will vary with the allelochemicals and insect species tested. However, some consistent patterns for M. sexta have emerged. The negative effects on caterpillar development of increasing allelochemical concentration changed across the gradient in night-time temperatures. At one thermal regime (26:22°C), M. sexta growth was disproportionately reduced by intermediate concentrations of each of three allelochemicals tested.","Chlorogenic acid; Global warming; Manduca sexta; Nutritional ecology; Plant-herbivore interactions; Tomatine","allelochemicals; herbivory; insect performance; specialist herbivore; temperature; Manduca sexta; Solanaceae",,,,,,"Ali, A., Luttrell, R.G., Schneider, J.C., Effects of temperature and larval diet on development of the fall armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (1990) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 83, pp. 725-733; Beck, S.D., Insect thermoperiodism (1983) Annual Review of Entomology, 28, pp. 91-108; Bloem, K.A., Kelley, K.C., Duffey, S.S., Differential effect of tomatine and its alleviation by cholesterol on larval growth and efficiency of food utilization in Heliothis zea and Spodoptera exigua (1989) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 15, pp. 387-398; Duffey, S.S., Bloem, K.A., Campbell, B.C., Consequences of sequestration of plant natural products in plant-insect-parasitoid interactions (1986) Interactions of Plant Resistance and Parasitoids and Predators of Insects, pp. 31-60. , D.
