In this paper, the introduction of SMES into a power system and its effects on energy and on environmental issues are addressed. The analysis results show that the introduction of SMES can considerably cut down CO 2 emissions without increasing the production cost if it substitutes for the operation of thermal plants during peak load period. However, to achieve this, nuclear plants are also needed for charging purposes. Thus, an algorithm to find the best generation mix, subject to CO 2 emissions constraints and nuclear plant introduction constraints, is proposed. The inclusion of nuclear plant constraints increases the coal consumption, hence CO 2 emissions. Nevertheless, in most of the analyzed cases, the introduction of SMES could attain important cost savings and environmental conservation.",,"Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Nuclear power plants; Energy analysis; Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems (SMES); Electric power systems",,,,,,"Uchiyama, Y., Yamamoto, H., Energy analysis on power generation plants (1991) Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry Report, Y90015; Uchiyama, Y., Yamamoto, H., Greenhouse effect analysis of power generation plants (1992) Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry Report, Y91005; (1984) Research on Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage Systems [II], , NEDO-P-8305; (1985) Research on Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage Systems [III], , NEDO-P-8408; Yasuda, K., Nishiya, K., Hasegawa, J., Determination of the best mix and the optimum introduction procedure of the various power sources including electric energy storage systems (1988) Technical Meeting of Power Engineering, , IEE Japan, PE-88-50; Tanaka, T., Nanahara, T., Kurihara, I., Prospect of energy storage in future electric power network of Japan -Consideration from night time surplus of electric power (1994) Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry Report, , T93064; Kamiya, S., Tanaka, E., Hasegawa, J., Shirasaki, T., Energy and greenhouse effect analysis of a superconducting magnetic energy storage system (1995) Technical Meeting of Power Engineering, , IEE Japan, PE-95-109; Kamiya, S., Tanaka, E., Kita, H., Hasegawa, J., Shirasaki, T., Energy and greenhouse effect analysis of a power system considering superconducting magnetic energy storage system (SMES) (1997) Technical Joint Meeting of Power Engineering and Power System Engineering, , IEE Japan, PE-PSE-97-94; (1996) Energy and Resources Handbook, p. 60. , Ohm Press","Kamiya, Shunichi; Hokkaido UnivJapan",,,"Scripta Technica Inc, New York, NY, United States",,,,,04247760,,EENJA,,"English","Electr Eng Jpn",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034165893
