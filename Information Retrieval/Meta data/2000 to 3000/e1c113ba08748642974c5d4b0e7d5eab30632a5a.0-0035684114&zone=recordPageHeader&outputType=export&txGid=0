This, in turn, will decrease the net emission of carbon dioxide. A number of studies exist that calibrate the contribution of various individual, site-specific conservation practices on changes in soil organic carbon. There is a general absence, however, of a comprehensive effort to measure objectively the contribution of these practices including conservation tillage, the Conservation Reserve Program, and conservation buffer strips to change in soil organic carbon. This paper fills that void. After recounting the evolution of the use of the various conservation practices, it is estimated that organic carbon in the soil in 1998 in the United States attributable to these practices was about 12.2 million metric tons. By 2008, there will be an increase of about 25 percent. Given that there is a significant potential for conservation practices to lead to an increase in carbon sequestration, there are a number of policy options that can be pursued.","Carbon sequestration; Conservation buffer strips; Conservation Reserve Program; Conservation tillage; Policy; Soil carbon; United States","agricultural practice; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; soil carbon; soil conservation; United States",,,,,,"Aase, J., Pikul, J., Terrace formation in cropping strips protected by tall wheatgrass barriers (1995) Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, 50, pp. 110-112; Barker, J., Baumgardner, G., Turner, D., Lee, J., Carbon dynamics of the conservation and wetland reserve programs (1996) Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, 51, pp. 340-346; Beare, M., Hendrix, P., Coleman, D., Water-stable aggregates and organic matter fractions in conventional and no-tillage soils (1994) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 58, pp. 777-786; Black, A., Tanaka, D., A conservation tillage cropping systems study in the Northern Great Plains of the United States (1997) Soil Organic Matter in Temperate Agroecosystems, , E.
