While its exact impacts on our water resources are hard to predict, there is a general consensus among scientists that it will result in more frequent and more severe hydrologic extremes (e. g. floods, droughts). Since rainfall is the primary input for hydrologic and water resource studies, assessment of the effects of climate change on rainfall is essential for devising proper short-term emergency measures as well as long-term management strategies. This is particularly the case for a region like the Korean Peninsula, which is susceptible to both floods (because of its mountainous terrain and frequent intense rainfalls during the short rainy season) and droughts (because of its smaller area, long non-rainy season, and lack of storage facilities). In view of this, an attempt is made in the present study to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on rainfall in the Korean Peninsula. More specifically, the dynamics of 'present rainfall' and 'future rainfall' at the Seoul meteorological station in the Han River basin are examined and compared; monthly scale is considered in both cases. As for 'present rainfall,' two different data sets are used: (1) observed rainfall for the period 1971-1999; and (2) rainfall for the period 1951-1999 obtained through downscaling of coarse-scale climate outputs produced by the Bjerknes Center for Climate Research-Bergen Climate Model Version 2 (BCCR-BCM2. 0) climate model with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emission Scenarios (IPCC SRES) 20th Century Climate in Coupled Models (20C3M) scenario. The 'future rainfall' (2000-2099) is obtained through downscaling of climate outputs projected by the BCCR-BCM2. 0 with the A2 emission scenario. For downscaling of coarse-scale climate outputs to basin-scale rainfall, a K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) technique is used. Examination of the nature of rainfall dynamics is made through application of four methods: autocorrelation function, phase space reconstruction, correlation dimension, and close returns plot. The results are somewhat mixed, depending upon the method, as to whether the rainfall dynamics are chaotic or stochastic; however, the dynamics of the future rainfall seem more on the chaotic side than on the stochastic side, and more so when compared to that of the present rainfall. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Chaos; Climate change; Close returns plot; Correlation dimension; Downscaling; Global climate model; Korea; Nonlinearity; Phase space; Rainfall","Chaos; Close returns plot; Correlation dimension; Down-scaling; Global climate model; Korea; Non-Linearity; Phase space; Rainfall; Climate models; Drought; Dynamics; Floods; Phase space methods; Rain; Regression analysis; Stochastic systems; Water resources; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; correlation; downscaling; extreme event; global change; nonlinearity; rainfall; resource assessment; water management; water resource; Han Basin [Far East]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",,,,,,"Abarbanel, H.D.I., Lall, U., Nonlinear dynamics of the Great Salt Lake: system identification and prediction (1996) Clim Dyn, 12, pp. 287-297; Arnell, N.W., Hudson, D.A., Jones, R.G., Climate change scenarios from a regional climate model: estimating change in runoff in southern Africa (2003) J Geophys Res, 108 (D 16), pp. 4519-4528; Casdagli, M., Chaos and deterministic versus stochastic nonlinear modeling (1992) J R Stat Soc B, 54 (2), pp. 303-328; Chiew, F.H.S., McMahon, T.A., Modeling the impacts of climate change on Australian streamflow (2002) Hydrol Process, 16, pp. 1235-1245; Christensen, N., Lettenmaier, D.P., A multimodel ensemble approach to assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrology and water resources of the Colorado River basin (2007) Hydrol Earth Syst Sci, 11, pp. 1417-1434; Durman, C.F., Gregory, J.M., Hassell, D.C., Jones, R.G., Murphy, J.M., A comparison of extreme European daily precipitation simulated by a global and a regional climate model for present and future climates (2001) Q J R Meteorol Soc, 127 (573), pp. 1005-1015; Elsner, J.B., Tsonis, A.A., Nonlinear dynamics established in the ENSO (1993) Geophys Res Lett, 20, pp. 213-216; Farmer, D.J., Sidorowich, J.J., Predicting chaotic time series (1987) Phys Rev Lett, 59, pp. 845-848; Fowler, H.J., Blenkinsop, S., Tebaldi, C., Linking climate change modeling to impacts studies: recent advances in downscaling techniques for hydrological modeling (2007) Int J Climatol, 27 (12), pp. 1547-1578; Frei, C., Schöll, R., Fukutome, S., Schmidli, J., Vidale, P.L., Future change of precipitation extremes in Europe: an intercomparison of scenarios from regional climate models (2006) J Geophys Res Atmos, 111, pp. D06105. , doi:10.1029/2005JD005965; Gilmore, C.G., A new test for chaos (1993) J Econ Behav Organ, 22, pp. 209-237; Grassberger, P., Procaccia, I., Measuring the strangeness of strange attractors (1983) Physica D, 9, pp. 189-208; Hewitson, B.C., Crane, R.G., Climate downscaling: techniques and application (1996) Clim Res, 7, pp. 85-95; Holzfuss, J., Mayer-Kress, G., An approach to error-estimation in the application of dimension algorithms (1986) Dimensions and Entropies in Chaotic Systems, , G.
