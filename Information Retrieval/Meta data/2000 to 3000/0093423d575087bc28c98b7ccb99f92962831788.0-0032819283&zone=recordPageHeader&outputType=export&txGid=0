Greenhouse gases, primarily from the production and combustion of fossil fuels for human energy needs, are heating up our atmosphere, changing our climate, and threatening the health and well-being of people the world over. Predicted consequences of climate change include more frequent extreme weather events such as intensive precipitation, drought and floods, rising sea levels, increased smog in cities, and the possible spread of tropical diseases to more temperate climes. These grim effects can be limited if societies throughout the world act quickly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Substantially reducing emissions, however, means a fundamental shift in the way we produce and consume energy. To help bring about change, scientists, health professionals and nongovernment organizations such as the David Suzuki Foundation must work together to educate and motivate the public, industries, business organizations, and governments to take actions that will reduce the threat of global warming.",,"climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; Lateolabrax japonicus",,,,,,"(1999) Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases, , Position Statement adopted 28 January, 1999; (1998) $33 Billion Damage Blamed on El Niño, , 18 November, 1998; (1999) Europe to Create Millions of Environmental Jobs, , 26 January, 1999; Kyoto's unfinished business (1998) Globe and Mail, pp. A30. , Editorial, 4 November, 1998; Fat and famous: Churchill bears are going hungry (1999) Globe and Mail, pp. A3. , 4 January, 1999; (1998) Climate Change and Its Impacts, , www.meto.gov.uk/sec5/CR-div/Brochure98/, November, 1998; Hamm, J., Darling-Kovanic, G., (1999) Turning Down the Heat: The New Energy Revolution, , Jim Hamm Productions Ltd. and the National Film Board of Canada; Hansen, J., Sato, M., Lacis, A., Ruedy, R., Tegen, I., Matthews, E., Climate forcings in the industrial era (1998) Proceedings from the National Academy of Sciences, 95, pp. 12753-12758; Hansen, J., Sato, M., Glascoe, J., Ruedy, R., Common sense climate index: Is climate changing noticeably?
