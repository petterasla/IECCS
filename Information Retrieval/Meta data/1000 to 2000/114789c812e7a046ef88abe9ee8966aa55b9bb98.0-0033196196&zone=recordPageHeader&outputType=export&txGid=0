The chainsaw bar oil case study is used to demonstrate the methodologies used and results obtained. Chainsaw bar oil is a total-loss oil, and has considerable potential for substitution of the conventional base oil (mineral oil) with rapeseed oil. Results are presented from LCA impact assessments of the mineral oil and rapeseed oil chainsaw lubricants. Several scenarios were compared using different co-product allocation and alternative land-use assumptions. Global warming potential (GWP) impacts were lower for rapeseed chainsaw oil, in all scenarios, than for the mineral oil product. Other environmental impacts illustrated that both assumptions (i.e. whether to examine the total or marginal impacts) and allocation can strongly influence conclusions. The most realistic scenario for rapeseed oil was considered to be 70% allocation of burdens to the oil, with winter wheat impacts subtracted from those of oilseed rape. With this scenario, all environmental impacts considered for chainsaw lubricants were lower for rapeseed oil. Monetary valuation of impacts through CBA varied, depending on the valuation system used, but in general rapeseed oil chainsaw lubricant had lower costs than the mineral oil product. Allocating some of the environmental burdens of crop production and crushing to rapeseed meal, and consideration of marginal impacts relative to alternative land uses increased the apparent environmental benefits of rapeseed oil chainsaw lubricant. Combination of LCA and CBA will require further development but affords new opportunities for socio-economic interpretation of environmental aspects.","CBA; Chainsaw lubricants; LCA; Rapeseed oil",,,,,,,"(1991) A Technical Frame Work for Life-cycle Assessments, , Washington, D.C.: SETAC and SETAC Foundation; Carruthers, S.P., Walker, K.C., Wightman, P.S., Cost-benefit analysis, including life-cycle assessment, of oils produced from UK-grown crops compared with mineral oils (1999) Final Report of a Project for MAFF, , UK, August 1999; Lecrand, J., High performing lubricants based on renewable resources (1997) Proceedings of the Wageningen Symposium, pp. 100-104. , DERKSEN JT, MANCAN C, MOGENDORFF J, DASKALEROS T, eds.
