The retention time for CO2 increases rapidly with depth of disposal, from a few years in the mixed layer up to several centuries as the depth increases beyond 1000 m, suggesting that deep oceans should be considered as potential storage sites for CO2. However, CO2 collection and disposal consumes energy and produces extra CO2. We show that some of this extra this CO2 reaches the atmosphere, so that atmospheric concentrations from systems with marine disposal ultimately exceed those from systems without controls. In some circumstances they do so rapidly, making marine disposal less favorable than direct atmospheric release. Global Warming Potential can be used to compare systems. This highlights the difficult issues involved in determining what time scales are important in considering options to reduce concerns about global warming. © 1993.","Carbon cycle; CO2 disposal; CO2 separation; global climate change; global warming potential","Air pollution control; Atmospheric composition; Climatology; Flue gases; Greenhouse effect; Ocean dumping; Separation; Storage (materials); Carbon cycle; Carbon dioxide disposal; Deep ocean storage; Global climate change; Global warming; Marine disposal; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Hoffert, Callegari, Hseih, A box-diffusion carbon cycle model with upwelling, polar bottom water formation and a marine biosphere (1981) Carbon Cycle Modeling, Scope 16, pp. 287-305. , B.
