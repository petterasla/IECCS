Neither the group humans composition nor the humus substance properties fell beyond the limits typical of the humus status of recent soils. The fractional composition of the humus acids might undergo secondary alternations after the burial. The dependence between the humus type and the length of the biological activity period permitted us to make a paleoclimatic reconstruction of the bioclimatic conditions that might have existed during the formation of the loess deposits in the Minusinsk intermontane trough. It was shown that the soil-climatic zones were repeatedly alternating during the Quaternary period due to the global climate change. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2008.",,"Bioactivity; Characterization; Chemical analysis; Climate change; Soils; bioclimatology; climate change; humus; loess; paleoclimate; paleosol; Quaternary; Eurasia; Krasnoyarsk [Russian Federation]; Minusinsk Basin; Russian Federation",,,,,,"(1987) Anthropogenic Changes in Climate, , (Gidrometeoizdat, Leningrad) [in Russian]; Arkhipov, S.A., (1960) Stratigraphy of Quaternary Deposits and Problems in the Neotectonics and Paleography of the Central Yenisei River Basin, , (Akad.
