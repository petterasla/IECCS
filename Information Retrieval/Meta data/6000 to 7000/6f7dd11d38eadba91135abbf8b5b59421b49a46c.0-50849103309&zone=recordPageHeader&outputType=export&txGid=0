This creates potentially detrimental conditions for evergreen plants which must endure the full gamut of conditions. I hypothesize that (1) increased southerly aspect will correlate negatively with evergreen understory plant distributions; (2) derived environmental variables (summer and winter light and heat load) will predict variance in evergreen distributions as well as topographic position (aspect, slope, and elevation) and (3) winter light will best predict evergreen understory plant distributions. In order to test these hypotheses, survey data were collected characterizing 10 evergreen understory herb distributions (presence, abundance, and reproduction) as well as the corresponding topographical information across north- and south-facing slopes in the North Carolina mountains and Georgia piedmont. The best predictive models were selected using AIC, and Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear models were used to estimate the strength of the retained coefficients. As predicted, evergreen understory herbs occurred and reproduced less on south-facing than north-facing slopes, though slope and elevation also had robust predictive power, and both discriminated well between evergreen species. While the landscape variables explained where the plants occurred, winter light and heat load provided the best explanation why they were there. Evergreen plants likely are limited on south-facing slopes by low soil moisture combined with high temperatures in summer and high irradiance combined with lower temperatures in winter. The robust negative response of the understory evergreen herbs to increased winter light also suggested that the winter rather than the summer (or growing season) environment provided the best predictive power for understory evergreen distributions, which has substantive implications for predicting responses to global climate change. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","AIC; Bayesian; Climate; Community ecology; Piedmont; Southern Appalachian mountains","Bayesian analysis; climate change; community ecology; evergreen tree; global climate; herb; hypothesis testing; irradiance; Northern Hemisphere; piedmont; population distribution; slope; soil moisture; understory; Georgia; North America; North Carolina; United States",,,,,,"Ackerly, D.D., Knight, C.A., Weiss, S.B., Barton, K., Starmer, K.P., Leaf size, specific leaf area and microhabitat distribution of chaparral woody plants: Contrasting patterns in species level and community level analyses (2002) Oecologia, 130, pp. 449-457; Adams, W.W., Demmig-Adams, B., Rosenstiel, T.N., Ebbert, V., Dependence of photosynthesis and energy dissipation activity upon growth form and light environment during the winter (2001) Photosynth Res, 67, pp. 51-62; Adams, W.W., Zarter, C.R., Ebbert, V., Demmig-Adams, B., Photoprotective strategies of overwintering evergreens (2004) Bioscience, 54, pp. 41-49; Bale, C.L., Charley, J.L., The impact of aspect on forest floor characteristics in some eastern Australian sites (1994) For Ecol Manag, 67, pp. 305-317; Bolstad, P.V., Swift, L., Collins, F., Regniere, J., Measured and predicted air temperatures at basin to regional scales in the southern Appalachian mountains (1998) Agric for Meteorol, 91, pp. 161-176; Bolstad, P.V., Vose, J.M., McNulty, S.G., Forest productivity, leaf area, and terrain in southern Appalachian deciduous forests (2001) For Sci, 47, pp. 419-427; Cantlon, J.E., Vegetation and microclimates on north and south slopes of Cushetunk Mountain, New Jersey (1953) Ecol Monogr, 23, pp. 241-270; Desta, F., Colbert, J.J., Rentch, J.S., Gottschalk, K.W., Aspect induced differences in vegetation, soil, and microclimatic characteristics of an Appalachian watershed (2004) Castanea, 69, pp. 92-108; Fekedulegn, D., Hicks, R.R., Colbert, J.J., Influence of topographic aspect, precipitation and drought on radial growth of four major tree species in an Appalachian watershed (2003) For Ecol Manag, 177, pp. 409-425; Frank, E.C., Lee, R., (1966) Potential Solar Beam Irradiation on Slopes: Tables for 30 to 50 Degree Latitude, , U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest Range Experimental Station Research Paper, RM-18, 116; Galicia, L., Lopez-Blanco, J., Zarco-Arista, A.E., Filips, V., Garcia-Oliva, F., The relationship between solar radiation interception and soil water content in a tropical deciduous forest in Mexico (1999) CATENA, 36, pp. 153-164; Geiger, R., (1965) The Climate Near the Ground, , Harvard University Press Cambridge; Givnish, T.J., Montgomery, R.A., Goldstein, G., Adaptive radiation of photosynthetic physiology in the Hawaiian lobeliads: Light regimes, static light responses, and whole-plant compensation points (2004) Am J Bot, 91, pp. 228-246; Hicks, R.R., Frank, P.S., Relationship of aspect to soil nutrients, species importance and biomass in a forested watershed in West-Virginia (1984) For Ecol Manag, 8, pp. 281-291; Holst, T., Rost, J., Mayer, H., Net radiation balance for two forested slopes on opposite sides of a valley (2005) Int J Biometeorol, 49, pp. 275-284; Huebner, C.D., Randolph, J.C., Parker, G.R., Environmental-factors affecting understory diversity in 2nd-growth deciduous forests (1995) Am Midl Nat, 134, pp. 155-165; Hutchinson, G.E., (1957) Cold Spring Harbor Symp Quant Biol, 22, pp. 415-427; Hutchinson, G.E., Homage to Santa-Rosalia; Or, why are there so many kinds of animals?
