However, attempts to establish EC policy on global warming have coincided with intensifying conflict over moves to greater monetary and political union. The roles of The Netherlands, Germany, and the UK are contrasted in some detail, especially in relation to degrees of interventionism. The study concludes that a proposed carbon tax is likely to be favoured as leaving the least footprint of central political authority. However, the Community has also developed considerable informal sophistication to compensate for the formal limitations of its authority over member states. This is influenced by a network of NGOs able to pursue policy aims at the local level. © 1993.",,"comparative studies; emission control; environmental policy; European Community; global warming; greenhouse gas; Germany; Netherlands; UK",,,,,,"CEC, (1991) Proposal for a Council Decision on the Sharing Out of Emissions of CO2 Stabilisation Community Target by the Year 2000, , Directorate-General for Environment, DGXI, Brussels; Hawkins, (1984) Environment and Enforcement: Regulation and the Social Definition of Pollution, , Clarendon Press, Oxford; Sabatier, Knowledge, policy-oriented learning and policy change (1987) Knowledge: Creation, Diffusion, Utilisation, 8 (4), pp. 649-692; Wynne, (1987) Risk Management and Hazardous Wastes, , Springer, London and New York; Gerlach, Global thinking local acting (1991) Evaluation Review, 15 (1), pp. 120-148; Rayner, A cultural perspective on the structure and implementation of global environmental agreements (1991) Evaluation Review, 15 (1), pp. 75-102; EPS, (1991) Anticipating the Future EC Environmental Policy Agenda, , Environmental Policy Consultants, London; Haigh, The next round of environmental standards setting in the EC — beyond LCP: Carbon taxes and tradeable permits (1990) paper presented at conference on ‘Energy and the New Europe — The Global Dimension’, Chatham House, London; CEC, (1988) The Main Findings of the Commission's Review of Member States Energy Policies: The 1995 Community Energy Objectives, , CEC Directorate-General for Energy, Brussels, Communication from the CEC to the Council, COM(88) 174; Haigh, The European Community and international environmental policy (1991) The International Politics of the Environment: Actors, Interests, and Institutions, , A.
