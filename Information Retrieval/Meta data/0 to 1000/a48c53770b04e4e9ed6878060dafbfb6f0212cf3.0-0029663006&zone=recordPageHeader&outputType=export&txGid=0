Because CO 2 is believed to be the principal contributor to global climate change worldwide, and energy use is the largest source of CO 2 emissions, much effort was made to analyze the Bangladesh energy system. Carbon emissions and carbon uptake in forests were also accounted for. Emissions of methane from agriculture, livestock, and urban landfill waste were also included in the inventory. In 1990, energy production using fossil fuels accounted for 15.5 Tg of CO 2 emissions. Carbon emissions resulting from forestry were also calculated. It was found that about 5.46 Tg of carbon was removed/consumed from the forest sources in 1990. On the other hand, about 12.32 Tg of carbon was taken up in forests. Based on these numbers, which exclude bamboo, the forests of Bangladesh acted as a net sink for approximately 6.86 Tg of carbon in 1990. Methane emissions in 1990 from flooded rice cultivation ranged between 257 and 622 Gg, with a median of 439 Gg CH 4. Methane emissions from the livestock sector were about 453 Gg CH 4. About 5.92 Gg CH 4 are emitted due to venting, flaring, and transmission and distribution of natural gas. Methane emissions from landfilled wastes in the major urban areas of Bangladesh contributed approximately 74 Gg CH 4.",,"agriculture; carbon emission; forestry; greenhouse gas; inventory; landfill; livestock; methane emission; Bangladesh",,,,,,"(1994) Vulnerability of Bangladesh to Climate Change and Sea Level Rise: Concepts and Tools for Calculating Risk in Integrated Coastal Zone Management, , (Technical Reports Volumes I and II.
