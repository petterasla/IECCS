This model, which is a scientifically-based parameterized simulation model, is used here primarily to help assess the effectiveness of various plausible policy options in mitigating the additional man-made greenhouse warming and the resulting sea level rise. For setting priorities it is important to assess the effectiveness of the various measures by which the greenhouse effect can be reduced. To this end we take a scenario business-as-usual as a reference case and study the mitigating effects of the following four packages of measures: The Copenhagen Agreements on CFC, HCFC, and halon reduction, the Tropical Forest Preservation Plan of the Climate Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament on CO2 reduction, a detailed reduction scheme for energy-related CO2, and a preliminary scheme for CH4, CO, and N2O reduction. The model results emphasize the importance of trace gases other than CO2 in mitigating additional man-made greenhouse warming. According to our preliminary estimates, CH4 could in the short term make a sizable contribution to the reduction of the greenhouse effect as could N2O in the medium and long term (with a relatively long lifetime of 150 yr). -from Authors",,"climate policy model; climatic policy; emission reduction; environmental management; greenhouse effect; modelling approach; planning technique; warming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028570566
