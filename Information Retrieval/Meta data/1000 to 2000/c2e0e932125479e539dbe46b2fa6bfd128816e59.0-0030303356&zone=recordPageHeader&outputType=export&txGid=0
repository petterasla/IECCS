A few cities have adopted programs to deal with impacts they perceive may occur, and a worldwide network of 100 cities involved with CO2 reduction has recently emerged. Global warming is a new issue for cities and most are only dimly aware of how it may affect them. Toronto, through the efforts of a few leaders, has become a pioneer in the development of an urban response program to global warming. It has charged a city agency to deal with global warming issues, in particular emissions reduction. Chicago is aware of the issue and is concerned about the negative impacts global warming could produce. While behind Toronto, Chicago is moving forward in a number of areas. These two cities illuminate the policy-making process for global warming at the urban level and the role 'policy entrepreneurs' can play at this level. In comparing the two cities, a common model of policy development is utilized.",,"anthropogenic impact; global warming; policy; urban area; urban response; Canada, Ontario, Toronto; USA, Illinois, Chicago",,,,,,"Boffey, P., Japan Confronts Global Warming (1992) New York Times, pp. 16E. , July 19, 1992; Bolt, Debra, City of Chicago, interview Sep. 1, 1995a, Nov. 9, 1995bChangnon, S.A., The Drought, Barges, and Diversion (1989) Bull.
