Thereafter inherent problems in regard to IWRM in LDCs are identified. This is followed by examples from four case studies in southern African catchments which focus on some of the uniquenesses of IWRM issues in LDCs which, in the author's experiences, are often forgotten by theorists and practitioners from the ""North"", viz. that while catchment studies tend to emphasise mainstem river discharge characteristics, these are not the sources of rural water supply problems in LDCs (a case study from the Thukela HELP catchment in South Africa); water poverty is acute in many meso-scale catchments and is likely to be exacerbated by global warming (again, a case study from the Thukela catchment); water quality problems for the rural poor, who are still without potable water supplies, frequently revolve around the biological health of rivers, rather than those related to chemical or physical water quality (a case study from the Mgeni catchment in South Africa); and climate change may have severe impacts on both within-country reservoir management and out-of-country outflow obligations to downstream countries on already stressed catchments dominated by high water demanding irrigated crops (a case study from the Mbuluzi catchment in Swaziland). In each case study simulation modelling has been used as a tool in IWRM. A concluding section therefore focuses on some selected problems which have been identified by the author in regard to hydrological modelling in LDCs. These revolve around issues of governance, human resources and practicalities. © 2007 Springer.","Biological river health; Climate change; Downstream water obligations; Hydrological modelling; Integrated water resources management; Lesser developed countries; Water poverty","Downstream water obligations; Hydrological modelling; Integrated Water Resources Management; Lesser developed countries; River health; Climate change; Computer simulation; Developing countries; Global warming; Research; Runoff; Water quality; Water resources; Water supply; Catchments",,,,,,"Ashton, P., (2000) Integrated Catchment Management: Balancing Resource Utilisation and Conservation, pp. 1-11. , CSIR, Pretoria, RSA, Aquatic Biomonitoring Course Notes; Calder, I.R., Water resource and land use issues (1998) SWIMPaper 3, , InternationalWater Management Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka; Calder, I.R., (1999) The Blue Revolution: Land Use and Integratedwater Resources Management, p. 192. , Earthscan, London, UK; Dlamini, D., Schulze, R.E., Meso-scale indicators of water poverty in the Thukela catchment, South Africa, under baseline land cover conditions (2004) Development and Evaluation of An Installed Hydrological Modelling System, pp. 150-179. , In: Schulze RE, Pike A (eds) .Water Research Commission, Pretoria, RSA, WRC Report No 1155/1/04; Dlamini, D., Schulze, R.E., How do simulated sediment yields vary spatially and temporally under different land uses and states of degradation or rehabilitation : A Case Study from the Mbuluzi Catchment in Swaziland (2004) Modelling As A Tool in Integrated Water Resources Management: Conceptual Issues and Case Study Applications, pp. 222-232. , In: Schulze RE (ed) Water Research Commission, Pretoria, RSA, WRC Report 749/1/04, Chapter 12; Dlamini, D., Schulze, R.E., Water poverty within a context of climate change: A case study at meso-scale in the Thukela catchment (2005) Climate Change and Water Resources in Southern Africa: Studies on Scenarios, Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation, pp. 387-394. , In: Schulze RE (ed) .Water Research Commission, Pretoria, RSA, WRC Report 1430/1/05, Chapter 24; (1996) The Philosophy and Practice of Integrated Catchment Management: Implications for Water Resource Management in South Africa, p. 140. , DWAF.
