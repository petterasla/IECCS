While we show that the lifefimes of c-C4F8 and SF6 may be significantly shorter than previously estimated, these compounds remain extremely long-lived with significant global warming potentials. -from Authors",,"atmospheric lifetime; fluorinated compound; global warming potential; ion reaction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028848985
