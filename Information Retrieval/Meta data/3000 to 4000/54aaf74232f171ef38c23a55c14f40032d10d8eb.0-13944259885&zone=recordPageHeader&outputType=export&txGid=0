The modifications included parameterization of management practices (e.g., forest harvest, chopping, burning, water management, fertilization, and tree planting), inclusion of detailed anaerobic biogeochemical processes for wetland soils, and utilization of hydrological models for quantifying water table variations. A 150-year management scenario consisting of three stages of wetland forest, deforestation/drainage, and wetland restoration was simulated with the Wetland-DNDC for two wetlands in Minnesota and Florida, USA. The impacts of the management scenario on carbon ecosystem exchange, methane emission, and nitrous oxide emission were quantified and assessed. The results suggested that: (1) the same management scenario produced very different consequences on global warming due to the contrast climate conditions; and (2) methane and nitrous oxide fluxes played nonnegligible roles in mitigation in comparison with carbon sequestration. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","C sequestration; Forest management; Process-based model; Trace gas emissions; Wetland","Biochemical engineering; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Geochemistry; Harvesters; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Trace analysis; Wetlands; C sequestraion; Carbon sequestration; Process-based model; Trace gas emissions; Forestry; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon sequestration; forest ecosystem; modeling; trace gas; wetland; article; carbon sequestration; deforestation; ecosystem restoration; environmental management; fertilization; forest; forest management; greenhouse effect; harvesting; land drainage; planting time; synecology; water management; wetland; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forest Management; Trace Elements; Wetlands",,"methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Anderson, I.C., Levine, J.S., Relative rates of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide production by nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and nitrate respirers (1986) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 51, pp. 938-945; Bader, F.G., Analysis of double-substrate limited growth (1978) Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 20, pp. 183-202; Birdsey, R., Heath, L.S., Forest inventory data, models, and assumptions for monitoring carbon flux (2001) Soil Carbon Sequestration and the Greenhouse Effect, pp. 137-154. , R.
