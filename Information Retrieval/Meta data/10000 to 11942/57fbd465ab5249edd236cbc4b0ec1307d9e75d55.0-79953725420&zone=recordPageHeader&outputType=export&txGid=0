Failure to address these challenges will inhibit the growth of the developing world and will negatively impact the standard of living and security of future generations in all nations. The solutions to these challenges will require multidisciplinary research across the social and physical sciences and engineering. Although perhaps not always recognized, geotechnical engineering expertise is critical to the solution of many energy and sustainability-related problems. Hence, geotechnical engineers and academicians have opportunity and responsibility to contribute to the solution of these worldwide problems. Research will need to be extended to non-standard issues such as thermal properties of soils; sediment and rock response to extreme conditions and at very long time scales; coupled hydro-chemo-thermo-bio-mechanical processes; positive feedback systems; the development of discontinuities; biological modification of soil properties; spatial variability; and emergent phenomena. Clearly, the challenges facing geotechnical engineering in the future will require a much broader knowledge base than our traditional educational programs provide. The geotechnical engineering curricula, from undergraduate education through continuing professional education, must address the changing needs of a profession that will increasingly be engaged in alternative/renewable energy production; energy efficiency; sustainable design, enhanced and more efficient use of natural resources, waste management, and underground utilization. © 2011 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","climate change; CO2 sequestration; education; energy; geothermal; hydrate; research; sustainability; underground storage","CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration; energy; geothermal; sustainability; underground storage; Anoxic sediments; Biomechanics; Curricula; Developing countries; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Feedback; Geotechnical engineering; Geothermal energy; Hydrates; Hydration; Knowledge based systems; Mechanical properties; Professional aspects; Research; Standardization; Sustainable development; Thermodynamic properties; Waste management; Climate change",,,,,,"Allen, R.D., Doherty, T.J., Fossum, A.F., (1982) Geotechnical Issues and Guidelines for Storage of Compressed Air in Excavated Hard Rock Caverns, PNL-4180, , Richland, Washington: Pacific Northwest Laboratory; Allen, R.D., Doherty, T.J., Thoms, R.L., (1982) Geotechnical Factors and Guidelines for Storage of Compressed Air in Solutionmined Salt Cavities, PNL-4242, , Richland, Washington: Pacific Northwest Laboratory; Allen, R.D., Doherty, T.J., Erikson, R.L., Wiles, L.E., (1983) Factors Affecting Storage of Compressed Air in Porous-Rock Reservoirs, PNL-4707, , Richland, Washington: Pacific Northwest Laboratory; (2008) Coal Combustion Product (CCP) production & use survey report, , www.acaausa.org, American Coal Ash Association, Available at; (2010) Homepage, , http://www.acaausa.org/index.cfm, American Coal Ash Association; Anderson, B., Batchelor, A.S., Blackwell, D.D., Dipippo, R., Drake, E.M., Garnish, J., Livesay, B., Veatch, J., (2006) The Future of Geothermal Energy, , Boston: Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Andre, L., Audigane, P., Azaroual, M., Menjoz, A., Numerical modeling of fluid-rock chemical interactions at the supercritical CO2-liquid interface during CO2 injection into a carbonate reservoir, the Dogger aquifer (Paris Basin, France) (2007) Energy Conversion and Management, 48 (6), pp. 1782-1797; Aydin, A., Borja, R.I., Eichhubl, P., Geological and mathematical framework for failure modes in granular rock (2006) Journal of Structural Geology, 28 (1), pp. 83-98; Beke, B., (1964) Principles of Comminution, , Budapest: Akademiai Kiado; Brandl, H., Energy foundations and other thermo-active ground structures (2006) Geotechnique, 56 (2), pp. 81-122; Brown, K.M., Bekins, B., Clennell, B., Dewhurst, D., Westbrook, G., Heterogeneous hydrofracture development and accretionary fault dynamics (1994) Geology, 22 (3), pp. 259-262; Ceglarska-Stefanska, G., Zarebska, K., Expansion and contraction of variable rank coals during the exchange sorption of CO2 and CH4 (2002) Adsorption Science and Technology, 20 (1), pp. 49-62; Chu, S., Carbon capture and sequestration (2009) Science, 325 (5948), p. 1599; Dejong, J.T., Mortensen, B.M., Martinez, B.C., Nelson, D.C., Bio-mediated soil improvement (2008) Ecological Engineering, 36 (2), pp. 197-210; (2009) Electric power annual 2007, , http://www.eia.doe.gov/bookshelf/brochures/epa/epa.html, Department of Energy, U.
