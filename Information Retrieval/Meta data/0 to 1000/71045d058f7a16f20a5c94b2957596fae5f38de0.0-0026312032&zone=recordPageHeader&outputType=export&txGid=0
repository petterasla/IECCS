Two stable equilibrium points are found which, in agreement with earlier work, refer to the current (warm) climate and a cold climate. However, perturbations in global temperature must be extremely large (< -20°C) to drive the warm climate into the cold climate. The domains of attraction in phase space are dependent on temperature, but also on humidity. Starting from an ice covered state, the climatic trajectory approaches the present state, if humidity is above some threshold value initially, but evolves into the cold state, if it lies below. The great stabilizers of the model are IR damping and the atmospheric heat transport which is assumed to depend quadratically on the meridional temperature gradient. -from Author",,"climate model; energy balance; external forcing; hydrological cycle; sensitivity; stability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026312032
