Four records (Lüideritz, Port Nolloth, Simonstown and Mossel Bay) approach 30 years in duration. An exploratory statistical analysis revealed the presence of high frequency fluctuations, a distinct seasonal signal and a slowly varying interannual structure. The serial correlation suggested the use of Box-Jenkins models to separate out the various contributions and enabled statistical estimates of underlying trends in sea level with realistic error estimates to be made. A linear trend at Port Nolloth was significantly different from zero, and its consistency with the trend from the two other West Coast sites led to the conclusion that, over the past 30 years, sea level has been rising on the west coast of Namibia and South Africa at a rate estimated at 0, 12 ± 0, 04 cm·year−1. By contrast there was no consistent upward trend at Mossel Bay on the South Coast. These estimates agree with recent published estimates of a global rate of rise in sea level, tempered by the movement of the land surface relative to the ocean to compensate for ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment. Consequently, estimates of future rise in sea level attributable to global warming can be extrapolated to the coasts of Namibia and South Africa. © 1995 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"sea; sea level measurement; implications; longterm trends; sea level changes; Namibia; South Africa",,,,,,"Abraham, B., Box, G.E.P., Deterministic and forecast-adaptive time-dependent models (1978) Appl.
