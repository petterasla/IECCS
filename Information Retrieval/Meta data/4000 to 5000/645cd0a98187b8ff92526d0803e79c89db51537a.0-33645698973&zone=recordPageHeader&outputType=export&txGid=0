This paper applies an optimization procedure to identify optimal strategies for packages of transport policy instruments without, and then with, constraints on finance and targets for global warming and safety. Some exploratory tests have also been carried out on land use strategies, and they are reported here in brief. Results demonstrate that the methodology is robust and can be applied with different transport models and with constraints applied both to policy instruments and to objectives. All optimal strategies found involved substantial reductions in fare levels throughout the study area. Where it was not possible to change fares, the strategies were substantially less effective when measured against the objectives. Most optimal strategies involved increases in public transport frequencies, although their scale varied between cities. All optimal strategies included peak-period cordon charges to enter the city center, though the optimal level varied between cities. Financially constrained strategies were found to involve smaller fare reductions and higher cordon charges; in some cases frequency increases were smaller. These constrained optima still performed well; the greatest reduction in benefit was only 15%. The net present value of the benefit generated was about €2,000M (€1 = $1.20 US, 2005) in Edinburgh and more than €4,000M in Leeds, United Kingdom. The impact of transport strategies on land use was small, and development constraints had to be used to reverse urban sprawl.",,"Global warming; Land use; Optimization; Public policy; Transportation charges; Urban planning; Cordon charges; Policy instruments; Public transport frequencies; Transport policy; Transportation",,,,,,"(1998) A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone, , TSO, London; May, A.D., Integrated transport strategies: A new approach to urban transport policy formulation in the UK (1991) Transport Reviews, 11 (2), pp. 223-247; (1995) Urban Transport and Sustainable Development, , ECMT/Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris; Fowkes, A.S., Bristow, A.L., Bonsall, P.W., May, A.D., A shortcut method for strategy optimization using strategic transport models (1998) Transportation Research A, 32 (2), pp. 149-157; May, A.D., Shepherd, S.P., Timms, P.M., Optimum transport strategies for European cities (2000) Transportation, 27, pp. 285-315; May, A.D., Emberger, G., Shepherd, S.P., Methods to identify optimal land use and transport policy packages: A comparison of area wide and spatially constrained policies (2004) Proc., 10th World Conference on Transport Research, , Istanbul, Turkey, July 4-8; Paulley, N., Zhang, X., Ash, A., Emberger, G., Shepherd, S.P., The design of optimal transport strategies: The Impacts of land use and transport interactions (2004) Proc., Association for European Transport Conference, , Strasbourg, France; Simmonds, D.C., Still, B.G., DELTA/START: Adding land use analysis to integrated transport models (1999) Proc., 8th World Conference on Transport Research, 4. , Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands; (2002) Transport Policy Model User Manual, , http://www.trlsoftware.co.uk, Crowthorne, TRL, Accessed August 2005; Pfaffenbichler, P., Shepherd, S.P., A dynamic model to appraise strategic land use and transport policies (2003) European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research.
