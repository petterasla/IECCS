Long-term exploitation of paddy fields led to variations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and green house gases (GHGs) emissions which might contribute to global warming. In order to calculate the amount of global warming potentials (GWPs) of emissions from ricepaddies and find the correlations among rice yield, SOC storage and GWP, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was used to simulate SOC densities and fluxes of main GHGs emitted from paddy fields. After verification, simulation results were used to calculate SOC storages and 100-year GWPs from 1949 to 2009. Results indicated that SOC densities in depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm all kept increasing. Average methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were 278.55 kg carbon (kgC) ha-1 a-1 and 2.22 kg nitrogen (kgN) ha-1 a-1. The SOC storage (0-30 cm) had increased from 3.96 × 109kgC in 1949 to 47.85 × 109kgC in 2009. In addition, GWP emission was increasing exponentially in the past 61 years, from 0.16 × 106 Mg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-equivalents) to 66.36 × 106 Mg CO2-equivalents. Both SOC storage and GWP presented obviously linear relation to rice yields. Overall, the research suggested that long-term rice yields could be used to estimate the SOC storage and GWP variations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","DNDC model; Global warming potential; Paddy fields; Rice yield; Soil organic carbon","arable land; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; crop yield; decomposition; denitrification; emission inventory; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; paddy field; rice; soil carbon; soil organic matter; China; Jilin; Oryza sativa",,,,,,"(2010) Agricultural Economic Data, , http://www.jlagri.gov.cn, Cited 12 Oct 2010; Bazzaz, F.A., Williams, W.E., Atmospheric CO2 concentrations within a mixed forest: implications for seedling growth (1991) Ecology, 72 (1), pp. 12-16; Beheydt, D., Boeckx, P., Sleutel, S., Validation of DNDC for 22 long-term N2O field emission measurements (2007) Atmos Environ, 41, pp. 6196-6211; Cai, Z.C., Mosier, A.R., Effect of soil moisture to CH4 oxidation, N2O and CO2 emissions (1999) Soil, 6, pp. 289-298; Cai, Z.C., Tsuruta, H., Minami, K., Methane emission from rice fields in China: measurements and influencing factors (2000) J Geophys Res, 105 (D13), pp. 17231-17242; Chen, W.W., (2007) Studies on N2O emissions from paddy field ecosystem in Sanjiang Plain, , Master thesis, Jilin Agricultural University; Daum, D., Schenk, M.K., Influence of nutrient solution pH on N2O and N: emissions from a soil less culture system (1998) Plant Soil, 203, pp. 279-287; Fang, J.Y., Guo, Z.D., Piao, S.L., Chinese terrestrial vegetation carbon sink estimates in 1981 ~ 2000 (2007) Sci China, Ser D Earth Sci, 37 (6), pp. 804-812; Farahbakhshazad, N., Dinnes, D.L., Li, C., Modeling biogeochemical impacts of alternative management practices for a row-crop field in Iowa (2008) Agric Ecosyst Environ, 123, pp. 30-48; Fumoto, T., Kobayashi, K., Li, C., Revising a process-based biogeochemistry model (DNDC) to simulate methane emission from rice paddy fields under various residue management and fertilizer regimes (2008) Glob Chang Biol, 14, pp. 382-402; Han, G.X., Zhu, B., Gao, M.R., Research progress on methane emission from rice field in China (2003) Southwest China J Agric Sci, 16 (SUPPL), pp. 49-54; Hao, Q.J., Wang, Y.S., Song, C.C., CO2 budget in agroecosystems in the Sanjiang Plain (2007) J Agro Environ Sci, 26 (4), pp. 1556-1560; Huang, Y., Zhang, W., Zheng, X.H., Estimates of methane emissions from Chinese rice paddies by linking a model to GIS database (2006) Acta Ecol Sin, 26 (4), pp. 980-988; (2007) Climate change 2007 Synthesis report, , http://www.ipcc.ch, Cited 10 Oct 2010.
