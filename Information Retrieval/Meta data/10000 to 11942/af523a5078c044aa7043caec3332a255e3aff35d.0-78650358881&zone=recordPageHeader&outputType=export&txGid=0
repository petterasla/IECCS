Here we examine skeletal muscle characteristics supporting swimming and diving in one polar species, the narwhal, and use these attributes to further document this cetacean's vulnerability to unpredictable sea ice conditions and changing ecosystems. We found that extreme morphological and physiological adaptations enabling year-round Arctic residency by narwhals limit behavioral flexibility for responding to alternations in sea ice. In contrast to the greyhound-like muscle profile of acrobatic odontocetes, the longissimus dorsi of narwhals is comprised of 86.8%± 7.7% slow twitch oxidative fibers, resembling the endurance morph of human marathoners. Myoglobin content, 7.87 ± 1.72 g/100 g wet muscle, is one of the highest levels measured for marine mammals. Calculated maximum aerobic swimming distance between breathing holes in ice is <1,450 m, which permits routine use of only 2.6%-10.4% of ice-packed foraging grounds in Baffin Bay. These first measurements of narwhal exercise physiology reveal extreme specialization of skeletal muscles for moving in a challenging ecological niche. This study also demonstrates the power of using basic physiological attributes to predict species vulnerabilities to environmental perturbation before critical population disturbance occurs. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Aerobic dive limit; Climate change; Monodon monoceros; Myoglobin; Narwhal; Physiology; Sea ice; Skeletal muscle; Slow twitch fiber","adaptive radiation; behavioral response; developmental biology; disturbance; ecological approach; ecosystem approach; foraging behavior; functional morphology; global warming; ice cover; measurement method; muscle; oxidation; population structure; sea ice; sensitivity analysis; specialization; swimming; vulnerability; whale; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Cetacea; Mammalia; Monodon; Monodon monoceros",,,,,,"Bello, M.A., Roy, R.R., Martin, T.P., Goforth Jr, H.W., Edgerton, V.R., Axial musculature in the dolphin (Tursiops truncatus): Some architectural and histochemical characteristics (1985) Marine Mammal Science, 1, pp. 324-336; Blessing, M.H., Studies on the concentration of myoglobin in the sea-cow and porpoise (1972) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, 41 A, pp. 475-480; Comiso, J.C., Parkinson, C.L., Satellite-observed climate changes in the Arctic (2004) Physics Today, 57, pp. 38-44; Costill, D.L., Fink, W.J., Pollock, M.L., Muscle fiber composition and enzyme activities of elite distance runners (1976) Medicine and Science in Sports, 8, pp. 96-100; Derocher, A.E., Lunn, N.J., Stirling, I., Polar bears in a warming climate (2004) Integrative and Comparative Biology, 44, pp. 163-176; Dietz, R., Heide-Jørgensen, M.P., Movements and swimming speed of narwhals, Monodon monoceros, equipped with satellite transmitters in Melville Bay, northwest Greenland (1995) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 73, pp. 2106-2119; Dubowitz, V., (1985) Muscle biopsy: A practical approach, , Bailliere Tindall, London, UK; Ferguson, S.H., Stirling, I., McLoughlin, P., Climate change and ringed seal (Phoca hispida) recruitment in western Hudson Bay (2005) Marine Mammal Science, 21, pp. 121-135; George, J.C., Ronald, K., The harp seal, Pagophilus groenlandicus (Erxleben, 1777).
