However, heterogeneity of data in terms of ringing activity, recapture and re-sighting efforts and recovery probabilities as well as reporting probabilities of recoveries on a temporal and spatial scale are major obstacles to such analyses. Among 30 species of short-distance or partial migrants from Germany we found evidence for significantly increased proportions of winter recoveries within a distance less than 100 km in recent years in nine species. We found evidence for reduced mean recovery distances in eight species and evidence for increased mean recovery distances in five species. Increases in recovery distances might result from changes in reporting probabilities of hunted birds, density-dependent changes and probably other reasons. A tendency towards wintering at higher latitudes in recent years was found in 10 species while mean latitudes of winter recoveries moved southwards in three species. These results are mainly consistent with studies from other European regions. Changes in geographical distribution of recoveries may be interpreted from a global warming perspective, although only one study (Soutullo, 2003) has so far demonstrated direct relationships (although inconsistent) between migration distance (wintering latitude) and climate variables. Since other factors such as changes in land use, winter feeding, availability of garbage dumps and other environmental changes may affect the position of wintering areas, these changes have to be taken into account when changes in migratory behaviour are analysed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
