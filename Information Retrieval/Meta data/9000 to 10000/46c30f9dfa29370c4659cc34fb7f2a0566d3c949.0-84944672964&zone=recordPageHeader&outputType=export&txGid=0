This research integrated water values into forest management planning and explained their effects on forest dynamics. Model outputs as Net Present Value (NPV) and amounts of timber and water were used as performance indicators. The results showed that water production aimed strategies (*W) provided minimum timber production while timber production aimed strategies (*T) obtained minimum water production. Results also showed that reforestation of Forest Openings (FO) provide high timber and low water production. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","forest management; linear programming; LP; net present value; NPV; water production",,,,,,,"Alemdag, S., (1967) Turkiye’de Saricam Ormanlarinin Kurulusu, , Verim Gucu ve Bu Ormanlarin Isletilmesinde Takip Edilecek Esaslar, Teknik Bulten No 20, OAE Yayinlari, Ankara; Anderson, H.W., Hoover, M.G., Reinhart, K.G., (1976) Forests and Water: Effects of Forest Management on Floods, Sedimentation, and Water Supply, , General Technical Report, PSW-018, US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Berkeley, CA; Apps, M.J., Kur, W.A., Beukema, S.J., Bhatti, S.J., Carbon budget of the Canadian forest product sector (1999) Environmental Science & Policy, 2, pp. 25-41; Asan, U., Orman kaynaklarinin cok amacli kullanimi ve planlama sistemleri (1999) Ormanlarin Cok Amacli Planlanmasi Toplantisi, , 5–6 May, 1999, Bolu, Turkey; Baskent, E.Z., Jordan, G.A., Nurullah, A.M.M., Designing forest landscape (ecosystems) management (2000) The Forestry Chronicle, 76 (5), pp. 739-742; Baskent, E.Z., Jordan, G.A., Forest landscape (ecosystems) management with simulated annealing (2002) Forest Ecology and Management, 165 (1-3), pp. 29-45; Baskent, E.Z., Baskaya, S., Terzioglu, S., Developing and implementing participatory and ecosystem based multiple use forest management planning approach (ETCAP): Yalnizcam case study (2008) Forest Ecology and Management, 256, pp. 798-807; Bates, C.B., Henry, A.J., (1928) Forest and Streamflow at Wagon Wheel Gap, , Month Weather Review, Colorado, USDA Weather Bureau, Supplement No. 30; Benyon, R., England, J., Eastham, J., Polglase, P., White, D., (2007) Tree Water Use in Forestry Compared to Other Dry-Land Agricultural Crops In The Victorian Context: Report Prepared For The Department of Primary Industries Victoria to Promote Scientific Knowledge in This Area, , Ensis Technical Report 159, State of Victoria; Bonell, M., Brunijzeel, L.A., (2005) Forests, Water and People in the Humid Tropics: Past, Present and Future Hydrological Research for Integrated Land and Water Management, , Cambridge University Press, London; Bosch, J.M., Hewlett, J.D., A review of catchment experiments to determine the effects of vegetation change on water yield and evapotranspiration (1982) Journal of Hydrology, 55, pp. 3-22; Brooks, K.N., Folliott, P.F., Gregerson, H.M., Debano, L.F., (1997) Hydrology and the Management of Watersheds, , 2nd ed., Iowa State University Press, Iowa; Brown, A.E., Zhang, L., McMahon, T.A., Western, A.W., Vertessy, R.A., A review of paired catchment studies for determining changes in water yield resulting from alterations in vegetation (2005) Journal of Hydrology, 310, pp. 28-61; Brunijzeel, L.A., Hydrology of moist tropical forests and effects of conversion: a state of knowledge review (1990) A Publication of the Humid Tropics Programme, United Nations International Programme, , International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences, UNESCO/Amsterdam: Vrije Universiteit, Paris; Brunijzeel, L.A., Predicting the hydrological impacts of land cover transformation in the humid tropics: the need for integrated research (1996) Amazonian Deforestation and Climate, pp. 15-56. , Gash, J.H.C., Nobre, C.A., Roberts, J.M. and Victoria, R.L.
