Since energy industry is the major producer of CO2 it shares the responsibility of reducing the impact of CO2 emissions from various energy related activities. CO2 is generated by the energy industry in a number of different ways. Some of it is simply recovered in its natural state, for example production of CO2 with CO2 containing natural gases while some other are generated in the chemical conversion processes of upgrading, processing and manufacturing of chemicals, for example generation of CO2 as a by product in the manufacturing of hydrogen and syn-gas. While some activities in the energy sector results in the production of CO2, other activities also require consumption of CO2. Most important CO2 consuming operation is the injection of CO2 for the enhanced recovery of oils, which would otherwise be left unrecovered. This paper examines reduction in CO2 emissions in the energy production and processing activities in Alberta, by recovering all the CO2 produced and recycling the produced CO2 into the reservoir for enhanced oil recovery projects. The status of CO2 recovery processes is critically reviewed and feasibility of CO2 supply network connecting the production and utilisation sites in the context of the Province of Alberta is discussed. The CO2 supply network envisaged, may consist of pipelines, skid mount CO2 liquefaction plants and CO2 transport vehicles as well as CO2 injection compressors and wells. It is argued that zero net production of CO2 is possible under the proposed recycling options. © 1992.","CO2 separation and recycling; enhanced oil recovery",,,,,,,"Bailey, Webster, Progress in a Study of CO2 Capture and Use For EOR (1991) paper presented at the 41st Canadian Chemical Engineering Conference, , Vancouver, BC., October 7; (1991) CPA Statistical Data Book, , Canadian Petroleum Association, Calgary, Alberta; Chakma, Jha, CO2 Injection With Horizontal Wells for the Enhanced Recovery of Heavy Oils: A Comparison of 2D and 3D Model Experiments (1991) SPE 22593, , presented at the SPE Annual Technical Conference, Dallas, October 6–9; Marshall, (1992) New Guidelines Will Defuse Time Bomb, , Calgary Herald, February 22; Stalkup, Carbon Dioxide Miscible Flooding Past Present and Outlook For The Future (1978) Journal of Petroleum Technology, p. 1102. , Aug","Chakma, A.; Dept. of Chemical, Petroleum Engineering University of Calgary, Calgary, Alta.
