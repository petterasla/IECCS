Protective gases, such as SF6 and Novec™612, should be used in order to prevent the ignition of magnesium alloys during strip casting. However, protective gases have disadvantages such as global warming, high production cost and corrosion of steel based equipments. According to the recent study, the addition of CaO is the effective way to improve the ignition and oxidation resistance of magnesium alloy. CaO added AZ31 magnesium alloy strip casting could be manufactured with reduced protective gas during melting and without protective gas during strip casting. The minimum SF6 gas amount could be reduced under 50 ppm for 0.3mass%CaO added AZ31 magnesium alloy both under sealed and unsealed conditions. The strips of CaO added AZ31 magnesium alloys were almost uniform in terms of microstructure and hardness. © 2008 The Japan Institute of Metals.","AZ31 magnesium alloy; Calcium oxide; Strip casting process","Energy conservation; Forming; Hot rolling; Hot rolling mills; Hot working; Metal working; Casting and hot rolling; energy savings; Equipment costs; Protective gases; running costs; Single step; Space savings; Strip Casting; Casting",,,,,,"Holzkamp, U., Haferkamp, H., Niemeyer, M., (2000) Proc. 5th Int.
