(2000) Science, 288, pp. 1177-1178. , 19 May Approximately 10,000 reactor-years of nuclear power-plant operation have been realised. Apart from the accident at Chernobyl, only one accident occurred with fuel melting: in 1979 at Three Mile Island. Thus, the risk of an accident with fuel damage has averaged about one in 10,000 per reactor-year, corresponding under common assumptions to a large external release of radioactivity (such as in the Chernobyl accident) at a rate of some one to 100,000 per reactor-year. With about 400 reactors in operation, this corresponds to a Chernobyl-like accident once about every 250 years; notenotenotenoteJames, B., The atom's place in Europe's future (2000) International Herald Tribune, p. 8. , 15 June","Van Der Zwaan, B.; Institute for Environmental Studies, Free University, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,,,,,,,00396338,,,,"English","Survival",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0012901240
