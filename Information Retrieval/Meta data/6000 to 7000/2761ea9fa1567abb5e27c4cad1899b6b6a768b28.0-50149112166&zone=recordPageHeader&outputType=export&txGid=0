Knowledge of these environmental controls of flowering is important for production in commercial horticulture. Such information is also relevant for assessing whether or not a species is threatened by global warming. Here, for five Australian plant species, we document ways in which the environment regulates their flowering. Spring flowering of Crowea exalata 'Bindelong Compact' reflects a response to increased daily light integral, these plants showing no hint of a true long day photoperiodic response. Higher temperatures not only cause earlier flowering of this Crowea cultivar but also depress flower production (5% loss per 1 °C increase). By contrast, another Crowea, 'White Star', flowers only if exposed to cool temperatures (15 °C) at the time of the increase in daily light integral. Thus, in commercial horticulture, synchronous and rapid flowering of Crowea will be possible by shifting plants from shade to high light conditions. In nature, light intensity will also have a major impact on flowering. By contrast, best flowering of Lechenaultia formosa in spring is a response to short photoperiods at high temperature while L. biloba prefers long days and has potentially spring to summer flowering. Whereas rising summer temperatures could have a deleterious effect on flowering of C. exalata, global warming may have little impact on L. formosa and L. biloba which flower more profusely in warmer conditions. Another spring flowering species, Verticordia chrysantha, responds both to short days and to exposure to cool temperatures so its survival could be threatened by global warming. For Calytrix fraseri its late summer flowering in nature is explained by its requirement for an exposure to long days. When combined with information previously published for Australian plants, it is clear that there are no simple generalizations to explain why a plant species flowers when it does. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
