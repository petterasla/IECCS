In this study, technical, economic and environmental aspects of STW are investigated and compared with other alternatives for sludge management in small communities (&lt;2000 population equivalent). The performance of full-scale STW was characterised during 2 years. Sludge dewatering increased total solids (TS) concentration by 25%, while sludge biodegradation lead to volatile solids around 45% TS and DRI24h between 1.1 and 1.4 gO2/kgTS h, suggesting a partial stabilisation of biosolids. In the economic and environmental assessment, four scenarios were considered for comparison: 1) STW with direct land application of biosolids, 2) STW with compost post-treatment, 3) centrifuge with compost post-treatment and 4) sludge transport to an intensive wastewater treatment plant. According to the results, STW with direct land application is the most cost-effective scenario, which is also characterised by the lowest environmental impact. The life cycle assessment highlights that global warming is a significant impact category in all scenarios, which is attributed to fossil fuel and electricity consumption; while greenhouse gas emissions from STW are insignificant. As a conclusion, STW are the most appropriate alternative for decentralised sludge management in small communities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biosolids; Composting; Constructed wetlands; Drying reed beds; Sanitation, wastewater","Constructed wetlands; Decentralised; Electricity-consumption; Environmental aspects; Environmental assessment; Land applications; Life-cycle assessments; Low energies; Operational costs; Post treatment; Significant impacts; Sludge dewatering; Sludge management; Sludge treatment; Small community; Stabilisation; Sustainable technology; Total solids concentrations; Volatile solid; Wastewater treatment plants; Biodegradation; Biological materials; Biological water treatment; Biosolids; Centrifugation; Composting; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Rating; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Wetlands; Environmental impact; fossil fuel; biodegradation; biosolid; composting; constructed wetland; economic analysis; environmental impact; environmental technology; fossil fuel; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; sanitation; sludge; waste treatment; wastewater; acidification; article; biodegradation; biosolid; carbon footprint; centrifuge; compost; composting; constructed wetland; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; energy consumption; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; priority journal; sludge dewatering; sludge treatment; waste water treatment plant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Environment; Sewage; Soil; Spain; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Purification; Wetlands",,"Sewage; Soil",,,,"Adani, F., Lozzi, P., Genevini, P.L., Determination of biological stability by oxygen uptake on municipal solid waste and derived products (2000) Compost.
