Different surveys indicate that the present scenario does not economically justify islanding operation of active distribution networks with RDGs. With rising DG penetration, much benefit would be lost if the DGs are not allowed to island only due to conventional operational requirement of utilities. Technical studies clearly indicate the need to review parts of the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations (ESQCR) for successful islanded operations. Commercial viability of islanding operation must be assessed in relation to enhancement of power quality, system reliability and supply of potential ancillary services through network support. Demonstration projects under Registered Power Zone and Technical Architecture Projects should be initiated to investigate the utility of DG islanding. However these efforts should be compounded with a realistic judgement of the associated technical and economic issues for the development of future power networks beyond 2010. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
