Traditional least-cost generation-expansion planning has become inadequate due to the prevailing multiple, conflicting objectives such as cost, environmental degradation, and nuclear hazards. This particularly true with emerging concerns over carbon dioxide emissions that are believed to contribute to global warming. In this paper we present the preference-order dynamic programming approach, so that this new logic can be implemented with the already available dynamic-programming-based capacity-expansion planning tool, called Wien Automatic System Planning Package (WASP). Through our case study, we note the importance of considering global warming as well as nuclear hazards. We also note that substituting plants that use cleaner fuels such as natural gas for those that use carbon-intensive fuels such as coal is more effective in controlling carbon dioxide emissions. This substitution method is also more effective than replacing these plants with carbon dioxide-free nuclear units. © 1993 IEEE","carbon dioxide emissions; generation-expansion; multiple-criteria decision making; nuclear hazards; planning; preference-order dynamic programming","Carbon dioxide; Computer aided analysis; Decision support systems; Dynamic programming; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Nuclear power plants; Operations research; Optimization; Planning; Global warming Nuclear hazards; Multicriteria capacity-mix problem; Multicriteria generation-expansion planning; Multiple-criteria decision making; Preference-order dynamic programming; Wien Automatic System Planning Package; Electric utilities",,,,,,"Evans, G.W., Morin, T.L., Hybrid dynamic programming/ s branch-and-bound strategies for electric power generation planning (1986) IIE Trans, 18, pp. 138-147. , June; Moskowitz, H., Evans, G.W., Jimenez-Lerma, I., Development of a multiattribute value function for long range electrical generation expansion (1978) IEEE Trans.
