Interviews revealed that some residents believed temperatures were becoming warmer, but few perceived linkages between the threat of global climate change and energy use. The desire to reduce household expenditure motivated conservation measures more than concerns about environmental issues. The greenhouse effect was confused with the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion and reductions in the use of aerosol cans were judged to be appropriate policy responses to the threat of greenhouse warming. © 1991.",,"climatic change; energy-use decision; global warming; greenhouse effect; lay perception; urban area; Sweden, Umea",,,,,,"World Commission on Environment and Development, (1987) Our Common Future, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Owens, Wilhite, Household energy behavior in Nordic countries — an unrealized energy saving potential (1988) Energy, 13 (12), pp. 853-859; Johnson, Williams, Energy conservation in the global context (1987) Energy, 12 (10-11), pp. 907-919; Boyle, Global warming — a paradigm shift for energy policy (1989) Energy Policy, 17 (1), pp. 2-5; Everest, The greenhouse effect: issues for policy makers (1989) Energy Policy, 17 (2), pp. 171-181; Schneider, Preventing climate change (1989) Issues of Science and Technology, 15 (4), pp. 55-62; Hogan, Energy conservation: family values, household practices, and contextual variables (1976) PhD dissertation, , Michigan State University; Leonard-Barton, Rogers, (1979) Adoption of energy conservation among California houseowners, , Michigan State University, Palo Alto, CA, unpublished manuscript; Becker, Seligman, Fazio, Darley, Relating attitudes to residental energy use (1981) Environment and Behavior, 13 (5), pp. 59-69; Sverige bland de me miljömedvetna i Europa (1990) Västerbottens Kuriren, p. 10; Bolin, Döös, Jäger, Warwick, The Greenhouse Effect, Climate Change and Ecosystems (1986) SCOPE 29, , John Wiley and Sons, Chichester; DeQ.Robbin, Changing the sea level (1986) The Greenhouse Effect, Climate Change, and Ecosystems, pp. 323-359. , B.
