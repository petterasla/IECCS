In birds, predicted changes in global climate raise concerns over the ability of migratory species, especially long-distance migrants, to adapt to changes in spring weather conditions. At a riparian breeding site in southern Manitoba, we found that over 3 decades (1974 to 2003), migratory yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia) exhibited considerable plasticity in their timing of clutch initiation in response to mean May temperatures at the breeding site. Spring arrival dates estimated during the last 9 y of our study were also highly variable and correlated with mean May temperatures. By contrast, we found no support for an effect of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, a climatic phenomenon known to affect weather conditions on wintering grounds of yellow warblers, on spring arrival dates or timing of breeding. This suggests that El Niño/ Southern Oscillation did not have carry-over effects on spring arrival dates or timing of clutch initiation. The results from our study are consistent with the timing of breeding in Neotropical migrant songbirds being flexible and closely coupled with spring temperatures (mean daily May temperatures) at breeding sites. These findings are important for predicting how sensitive long-distance migrant birds may be to changes in spring conditions caused by climatic warming.","climate change; Delta Marsh; Dendroica petechia; El Niño/Southern Oscillation; Manitoba; temperature; timing of breeding; yellow warbler","annual variation; breeding season; breeding site; climate change; clutch size; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; marsh; migratory species; phenology; population dynamics; reproductive behavior; riparian zone; seasonality; songbird; temperature effect; Canada; Manitoba; Aves; Dendroica petechia; Passeri",,,,,,"Ahola, M., Laaksonen, T., Sippola, K., Eeva, T., Rainio, K., Lehikoinen, E., Variation in climate warming along the migration route uncouples arrival and breeding dates (2004) Global Change Biology, 10 (9), pp. 1610-1617. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00823.x; Berenson, M.L., Levine, D.M., Goldstein, M., (1983) Intermediate Statistical Methods and Applications: A Computer Package Approach, , Prentice-Hall Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Berthold, P., (1996) Control of Bird Migration, , Chapman and Hall London; Bety, J., Giroux, J.-F., Gauthier, G., Individual variation in timing of migration: Causes and reproductive consequences in greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus) (2004) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 57 (1), pp. 1-8. , DOI 10.1007/s00265-004-0840-3; Biermann, G.C., Sealy, S.G., Parental feeding of nestling yellow warblers in relation to brood size and prey availability (1982) Auk, 99 (2), pp. 332-341; Both, C., Visser, M.E., Adjustment to climate change is constrained by arrival date in a long-distance migrant bird (2001) Nature, 411 (6835), pp. 296-298. , DOI 10.1038/35077063; Both, C., Bijlsma, R.G., Visser, M.E., Climatic effects on timing of spring migration and breeding in a long-distance migrant, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca (2005) Journal of Avian Biology, 36 (5), pp. 368-373. , DOI 10.1111/j.0908-8857.2005.03484.x; Both, C., Artemyev, A.V., Blaauw, B., Cowie, R.J., Dekhuijzen, A.J., Eeva, T., Enemar, A., Visser, M.E., Large-scale geographical variation confirms that climate change causes birds to lay earlier (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271 (1549), pp. 1657-1662. , DOI 10.1098/rspb.2004.2770; Both, C.B., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.E., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Boulet, M., Gibbs, H.L., Hobson, K.A., Integrated analysis of genetic stable isotope, and banding data reveal migratory connectivity and flyways in the northern Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia; Aestiva group) (2006) Ornithological Monographs, 61, pp. 29-78; Briskie, J.V., Sealy, S.G., Hobson, K.A., Differential parasitism of least flycatchers and yellow warblers by the brown-headed cowbird (1990) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 27, pp. 403-410; Browning, M.R., A taxonomic review of Dendroica pete-chia (Yellow Warbler; Aves: Parulinae) (1994) Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, 107, pp. 27-51; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (1998) Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , Springer- Verlag New York, New York; Charmantier, A., McCleery, R.H., Cole, L.R., Perrins, C., Kruuk, L.E.B., Sheldon, B.C., Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to climate change in a wild bird population (2008) Science, 320 (5877), pp. 800-803. , DOI 10.1126/science.1157174; Cotton, P.A., Avian migration phenology and global climate change (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100 (21), pp. 12219-12222. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.1930548100; Crick, H.Q.P., The impact of climate change on birds (2004) Ibis, 146, pp. 48-56; Crick, H.Q.P., Sparks, T.H., Climate change related to egg-laying trends [8] (1999) Nature, 399 (6735), pp. 423-424. , DOI 10.1038/20839; Crick, H.Q.P., Dudley, C., Glue, D.E., Thomson, D.L., UK birds are laying eggs earlier (1997) Nature, 388, p. 526; Curson, J., Quinn, D., Beadle, D., (1994) Warblers of the Americas: An Identification Guide., , Houghton Mifflin Company New York, New York; Dunn, E.H., Hussell, D.J.T., Using migration counts to monitor landbird populations: Review and evaluation of current status (1995) Current Ornithology, 12. , Pages 43-88 in D.
