The impacts are expressed on the same scale, namely as fraction of the total per capita loads in a national scenario 1990, also called the person equivalent or PE1990. This provides a compact and informative overview of the environmental impacts and allows for a holistic prioritisation in the operation and management of the plant. The accounting shows that the resulting emissions per person in the catchment area of the plant correspond to 0.5-5.0% of the average Danish PE1990 for the impacts in question.","Energy; Environmental impact; LCA; Life cycle analysis; Resources; Wastewater treatment","Air; Deposition; Eutrophication; Global warming; Management; Toxicity; Wastewater treatment; Water; Holistic prioritisation; Environmental impact; biogas; environmental impact; expert system; wastewater treatment plant; acidification; air pollution; conference paper; ecology; effluent standard; energy consumption; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; incineration; power supply; sewage disposal; sludge disposal; soil pollution; toxicity; waste disposal; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; water pollution; Acid Rain; Animals; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Eutrophication; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Waste Disposal, Fluid",,"Acid Rain",,,,"Wenzel, H., Hauschild, M., Alting, L., (1997) Environmental Assessment of Products, , Chapman & Hall; Avedore WSC Green Account 1998 and 1999, , (in Danish); (1997) Wastewater Treatment - Vocabulary.
