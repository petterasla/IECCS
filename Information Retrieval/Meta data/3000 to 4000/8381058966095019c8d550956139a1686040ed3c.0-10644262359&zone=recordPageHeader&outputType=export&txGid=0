T2N 1N4, Canada","Two studies were conducted to gauge likely public perceptions of proposals to avoid releasing carbon dioxide from power plants to the atmosphere by injecting it into deep geological formations or the deep ocean. Following a modified version of the mental model interview method, Study 1 involved face-to-face interviews with 18 nontechnical respondents. Respondents shared their beliefs after receiving basic information about the technologies and again after getting specific details. Many interviewees wanted to frame the issue in the broader context of alternative strategies for carbon management, but public understanding of mitigation strategies is limited. The second study, administered to a sample of 126 individuals, involved a closed-form survey that measured the prevalence of general beliefs revealed in study 1 and also assessed the respondent's views of these technologies. Study results suggest that the public may develop misgivings about deep injection of carbon dioxide because it can be seen as temporizing and perhaps creating future problems. Ocean injection was seen as more problematic than geological injection. An approach to public communication and regulation that is open and respectful of public concerns is likely to be a prerequisite to the successful adoption of this technology.",,"Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Oceanography; Power plants; Geological formations; Mental model interview method; Public perceptions; Geology; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; emission control; perception; power plant; air pollution; air pollution control; article; ecological procedures; electric power plant; environmental release; geology; health survey; information; perception; public health; sea pollution; sewage disposal; Adult; Carbon Dioxide; Data Collection; Female; Fossil Fuels; Geology; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Incineration; Male; Middle Aged; Public Opinion; Risk Assessment; Seawater; Technology; Waste Management",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Fossil Fuels",,,,"Bruant, R.G., Guswa, A.J., Celia, M.A., Peters, C.A., Safe storage of CO2 in deep saline aquifers (2002) Environ.
