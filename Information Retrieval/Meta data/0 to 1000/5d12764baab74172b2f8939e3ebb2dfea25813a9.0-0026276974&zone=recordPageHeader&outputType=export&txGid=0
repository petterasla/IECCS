In contrast, the oceanic plankton were largely unaffected, implying a decoupling of the deep and shallow ecosystems. The data suggest that for a few thousand years, ocean circulation underwent fundamental changes producing a transient state that, although brief, had long-term effects on environmental and biotic evolution.",,"benthos; carbon; extinction event; global warming; isotope excursion; oxygen; palaeoceanography; Palaeocene; Antarctica",,,,,,,"Kennett, J.P.; Marine Science Institute, Department of Geological Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-6150, United States",,,,,,,,00280836,,NATUA,,"English","Nature",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026276974
