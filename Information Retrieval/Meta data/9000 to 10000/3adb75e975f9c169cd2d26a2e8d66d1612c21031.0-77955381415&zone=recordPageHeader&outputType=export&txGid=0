This paper summarizes the current situation of the issue, and introduces new waste concrete recycling processes via carbonic acid treatment. In the processes, alkaline calcium compounds in the hydrated cement part of waste concrete are extracted and precipitated as calcium carbonate (CaCO3). By utilizing this reaction, CaCO3 and clay alternative material can be produced from waste cement particles. Furthermore, combined use of the carbonic acid treatment and conventional mechanical grinding allows fine aggregates to be recycled from waste concrete. The process does not need any additional materials except water and carbon dioxide (CO2). The process is considered to be a promising option for waste concrete recycling. © 2010 The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Recycle; Recycled aggregate; Waste concrete","Alternative materials; Carbonic acids; Cement particles; Current situation; Fine aggregates; Hydrated cement; Material recycling; Mechanical grinding; Recycled aggregate; Recycled aggregates; Waste concrete; Calcium; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Cements; Concrete aggregates; Global warming; Hydrates; Organic acids; Recycling; Waste treatment",,,,,,"Iizuka, A., Fujii, M., Yamasaki, A., Yanagisawa, Y., A Novel Reduction Process of CO2 Fixation by Waste Concrete Treatment (2002) J.
