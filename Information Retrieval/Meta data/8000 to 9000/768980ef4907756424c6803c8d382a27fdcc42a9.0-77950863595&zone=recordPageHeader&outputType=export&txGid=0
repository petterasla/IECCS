In this study we created prototype solar-reflective nonwhite concrete tile and asphalt shingle roofing materials using a two-layer spray coating process intended to maximize both solar reflectance and factory-line throughput. Each layer is a thin, quick-drying, pigmented latex paint based on either acrylic or a poly(vinylidene fluoride)/acrylic blend. The first layer is a titanium dioxide rutile white basecoat that increases the solar reflectance of a gray-cement concrete tile from 0.18 to 0.79, and that of a shingle surfaced with bare granules from 0.06 to 0.62. The second layer is a ""cool"" color topcoat with weak near-infrared (NIR) absorption and/or strong NIR backscattering. Each layer dries within seconds, potentially allowing a factory line to pass first under the white spray, then under the color spray. We combined a white basecoat with monocolor topcoats in various shades of red, brown, green and blue to prepare 24 cool colored prototype tiles and 24 cool colored prototypes shingles. The solar reflectances of the tiles ranged from 0.26 (dark brown; CIELAB lightness value L*=29) to 0.57 (light green; L*=76); those of the shingles ranged from 0.18 (dark brown; L*=26) to 0.34 (light green; L*=68). Over half of the tiles had a solar reflectance of at least 0.40, and over half of the shingles had a solar reflectance of at least 0.25. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Asphalt shingle; Concrete tile; Cool colored roof; Polyvinylidene fluoride; Solar reflectance; Surface roughness","Asphalt shingles; Concrete tile; Concrete tiles; Polyvinylidene fluorides; Solar reflectance; Asphalt; Coatings; Concrete products; Global warming; Infrared devices; Oxide minerals; Photoresists; Reflection; Roofs; Solar energy; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Titanium; Titanium dioxide; Building materials",,,,,,"Levinson, R., Akbari, H., Potential benefits of cool roofs on commercial buildings: conserving energy, saving money, and reducing emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants (2010) Energy Efficiency, 3 (1), pp. 53-109; Rosenfeld, A.H., Romm, J.J., Akbari, H., Pomerantz, M., Cool communities: strategies for heat island mitigation and smog reduction (1998) Energy and Buildings, 28 (1), pp. 51-62; Akbari, H., Rose, L.S., Taha, H., Analyzing the land cover of an urban environment using high-resolution orthophotos (2003) Landscape and Urban Planning, 63, pp. 1-14; Akbari, H., Menon, S., Rosenfeld, A., Global cooling: increasing world-wide urban albedos to offset CO2 (2009) Climatic Change, 94, pp. 275-286; Levinson, R., Berdahl, P., Abkari, H., Miller, W., Joedicke, I., Reilly, J., Suzuki, Y., Vondran, M., Methods of creating solar-reflective nonwhite surfaces and their application to residential roofing materials (2007) Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 91, pp. 304-314; Berdahl, P., Akbari, H., Jacobs, J., Klink, F., Surface roughness effects on the solar reflectance of cool asphalt shingles (2008) Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 92 (4), pp. 482-489; Akbari, H., Levinson, R., Berdahl, P., Review of residential roofing materials, part I: a review of methods for the manufacture of residential roofing materials (2005) Western Roofing Insulation and Siding, pp. 54-57; Akbari, H., Levinson, R., Berdahl, P., Review of residential roofing materials, part II: a review of methods for the manufacture of residential roofing materials (2005) Western Roofing Insulation and Siding, pp. 52-58; Levinson, R., Berdahl, P., Akbari, H., Solar spectral optical properties of pigments, part I: model for deriving scattering and absorption coefficients from transmittance and reflectance measurements (2005) Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 89, pp. 319-349; Levinson, R., Berdahl, P., Akbari, H., Solar spectral optical properties of pigments, part II: survey of common colorants (2005) Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 89, pp. 351-389; Levinson, R., Berdahl, P., Akbari, H., (2009) Lawrence Berkeley National Lab Pigment Database: Characterizing the solar spectral radiative properties of conventional and cool pigmented coatings, , http://coolcolors.lbl.gov/LBNL-Pigment-Database/database.html, Online at; ASTM, (1996) ASTM E903-96: Standard Test Method for Solar Absorptance, Reflectance, and Transmittance of Materials using Integrating Spheres, , American Society for Testing and Materials, West Conshohocken, PA; R.
