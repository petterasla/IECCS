This article examines the potential of communication and marketing interventions to influence population behavior in ways consistent with climate change prevention and adaptation objectives. Specifically, using a framework based on an ecologic model of public health, the paper examines: (1) the potential of communication and marketing interventions to influence population behaviors of concern, including support for appropriate public policies; (2) potential target audiences for such programs; and (3) the attributes of effective climate change messages. Communication and marketing interventions appear to have considerable potential to promote important population behavior change objectives, but there is an urgent need for additional translational research to effectively harvest this potential to combat climate change. © 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",,"behavior change; climate change; environmental planning; evolutionary adaptation; marketing; persuasive communication; policy; public health; public health problem; review; social network; wellbeing; Communication; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Public Health; Social Behavior; Social Control, Informal; Social Marketing",,,,,,"Havel, V., Our moral footprint (2007) The New York Times, , Sep 27; Haines, A., Patz, J.A., Health effects of climate change (2004) JAMA, 291, pp. 99-103; Patz, J.A., Campbell-Lendrum, D., Holloway, T., Foley, J.A., Impact of regional climate change on human health (2005) Nature, 438, pp. 310-317; Patz, J.A., Olson, S.H., Climate change and health: global to local influences on disease risk (2006) Ann Trop Med Parasitol, 100, pp. 535-549; McMichael, A.J., Woodruff, R.E., Hales, S., Climate change and human health: present and future risks (2006) Lancet, 367, pp. 859-869; Haines, A., Kovats, R.S., Campbell-Lendrum, D., Corvalan, C., Climate change and human health: impacts, vulnerability and public health (2006) Public Health, 120, pp. 585-596; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
