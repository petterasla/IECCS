Evaluation of this hypothesis requires a mechanistic understanding of the in situ responses of individual components of tundra net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) to warming. In this study, we measured NEE, total ecosystem respiration and respiration from below ground in experimentally warmed plots within Alaskan acidic tussock tundra soil warming of 2-4°C during a single growing season caused strong increases in total ecosystem respiration and belowground respiration from moss-dominated inter-tussock areas, and similar trends from sedge-dominated tussocks. Consequently, the overall effect of the manipulation was to substantially enhance net ecosystem carbon loss during mid-summer. Components of vascular plant biomass were closely correlated with total ecosystem respiration and belowground respiration in control plots of both microsites, but not in warmed plots. By contrast, in the warmed inter-tussock areas, below-ground respiration was most closely correlated with organic-layer depth. Warming in tussock areas was associated with increased leaf nutrient pools, indicating enhanced rates of soil nutrient mineralisation. Together, these results suggest that warming enhanced net ecosystem CO2 efflux primarily by stimulating decomposition of soil organic matter, rather than by increasing plant-associated respiration. Our short-term experiment provides field evidence to support previous growth chamber and modelling studies indicating that arctic soil C reserves are relatively sensitive to warming and could supply an initial positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations/changing climate.","Carbon; Climate; Feedback; Nutrients; Respiration","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; ecosystem response; global warming; respiration; tundra; Arctic; Bryophyta; Tracheophyta",,,,,,"Aurela, M., Tuovinen, J.-P., Laurila, T., Carbon dioxide exchange in a subarctic peatland ecosystem in northern Europe measured by eddy covariance technique (1998) J Geophysical Res, 103, pp. 11289-11301; Billings, W.D., Peterson, K.M., Luken, J.O., Mortensen, D.A., Interaction of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and soil nitrogen on the carbon balance of tundra microcosms (1984) Oecologia, 65, pp. 26-29; Bret-Harte, M.S., Shaver, G.R., Zoerner, J.P., Johnstone, J.F., Wagner, J.F., Chavez, A.S., Gunkelman, I.V., Laundre, J.A., Developmental plasticity allows Betula nana to dominate tundra subjected to an altered environment Ecology, , in press; Chapin III, F.S., Van Cleve, K., Chapin, M.C., Soil temperature and nutrient cycling in the tussock growth form of Eriophorum vaginatum (1979) J Ecol, 67, pp. 169-189; Chapin III, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Laundre, J.A., Responses of Arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Chapman, W.L., Walsh, J.E., Recent variations of sea ice and air temperature in high latitudes (1993) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 74, pp. 33-47; Cheng, W., Virginia, R.A., Measurement of microbial biomass in Arctic tundra soils using fumigation-extraction and substrate-induced respiration procedures (1993) Soil Biol Biochem, 25, pp. 135-141; Christensen, T.R., Michelsen, A., Jonasson, S., Schmidt, I.K., Carbon dioxide and methane exchange of a subarctic heath in response to climate change related environmental manipulations (1997) Oikos, 79, pp. 34-44; Grulke, N.E., Reichers, G.H., Oechel, W.C., Hjelm, U., Jaeger, C., Carbon balance in tussock tundra under ambient and elevated CO2 (1990) Oecologia, 83, pp. 485-494; Hobbie, S.E., Chapin III, F.S., The response of tundra plant biomass, aboveground production, nitrogen, and CO2 flux to experimental warming (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1526-1544; Johnson, L.C., Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Rastetter, E.R., Laundre, J.A., Murray, G.L., Effects of drainage and temperature on carbon balance of tussock tundra microcosms (1996) Oecologia, 108, pp. 737-748; Jonasson, S., Michelsen, A., Schmidt, I.K., Nielsen, E.V., Responses in microbes and plants to changed temperature, nutrient and light regimes in the Arctic (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 1828-1843; Jones, M.H., Fahnestock, J.T., Walker, D.A., Walker, M.D., Welker, J.M., Carbon dioxide fluxes m moist and dry tundra during the snow-free season: Responses to increases in summer temperature and winter snow accumulation (1998) Arctic Alpine Res, 30, pp. 373-380; Kattenberg, A.F., Giorgi, H., Grassl, H., Meehl, J.F.B., Mitchell, R.J., Stouffer, T., Tokioka, A.J., Wigley, T.M.L., Climate models - Projections of future climate (1996), pp. 289-357. , Houghton JT, Meiro Filho LG, Callender BA, Henris N, Kattenberg A, Maskell K (eds) Climate change 1995.
