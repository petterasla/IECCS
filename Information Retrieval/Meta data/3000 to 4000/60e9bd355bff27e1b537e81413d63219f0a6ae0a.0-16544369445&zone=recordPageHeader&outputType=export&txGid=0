Habitat changes resulting from development for ecotourism, including a 19% increase in forest, might also be expected to impact bat populations. Analysis of data collected between 1973 and 1999 in Monteverde supports the hypothesis, although changes are less dramatic than those shown for birds, reptiles, and amphibians in earlier studies. Capture rates did not change significantly during the 27 year sample period, but relative species abundance increased, and at least 24 new species (of mostly lowland distribution) were recorded in the study area during the 1980s, 1990s, and through early 2002. These changes are likely a consequence of climatic change following global warming, forest clearing, and an increase in amount of secondary forest. This latter factor is a result of changes in land use due to development for tourism.","Bat populations and distribution; Chiroptera; Costa Rica; Global climate change","bat; climate change; cloud forest; ecotourism; global warming; Central America; Costa Rica; Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve; Puntarenas; Amphibia; Aves; Chiroptera; Mammalia; Reptilia; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Brown, J.H., Ernest, S.K.M., Parody, J.M., Haskell, J.P., Regulation of diversity: Maintenance of species richness in changing environments (2001) Oecologia, 126, pp. 321-332; Dinerstein, E., (1983) Reproductive Ecology of Fruit Bats and Seasonality of Fruit Production in a Costa Rican Cloud Forest, , Ph.D. dissertation, University of Washington, Seattle; Dinerstein, E., Reproductive ecology of fruit bats and the seasonality of fruit production in a Costa Rican cloud forest (1986) Biotropica, 18, pp. 307-318; Fogden, M.P.L., (1993) An Annotated Checklist of the Birds of Monteverde and Peñas Blancas, , Privately published by the author, Monteverde, Costa Rica; Holdridge, L.R., (1967) Life Zone Ecology, , Tropical Science Center, San José, Costa Rica; Kalko, E.K.V., Handley Jr., C.O., Handley, D., Organization, diversity, and long term dynamics of a Neotropical bat community (1996) Long Term Studies of Vertebrate Communities, pp. 503-553. , (M.
