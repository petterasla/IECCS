This process enables us to realize etching of materials without using any perfluorocompound (PFC) feed gases which have a high global warming potential (GWP). Etching characteristics together with diagnostics of the F atom density, CFx (x = 1-3) radical densities, electron density and temperature have been investigated as functions of pressure. As a result, it was found that etching rates of a-Si and W films were determined based on the F atom density, ion flux and ion bombardment energy. Furthermore, etching rates of a-Si and W films increased by heating the fluorocarbon species before introducing them into the plasma reactor. Thus, high rates of etching of a-Si and W films were successfully achieved by this novel etching process compared with conventional etching using ECR plasma with CF4/O2 feed gases.","Amorphous silicon tungsten; Chamber cleaning; CO2 laser; Etching; Fluorinated ethylene propylene; Global warming","Amorphous silicon; Atoms; Carbon dioxide lasers; Chemical vapor deposition; Density (specific gravity); Dry etching; Electron cyclotron resonance; Fluorocarbons; Global warming; Oxygen; Temperature; Tungsten; Carbon dioxide laser evaporation; Chemical vapor deposition chamber cleaning; Fluorinated ethylene propylene; Radical densities; Solid material evaporation system; Plasma applications",,,,,,"Fujita, K., Ito, M., Hori, M., Goto, T., (1999) J.
