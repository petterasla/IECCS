While economic criteria such as profit before taxes, payback period, and net present worth are well established, environmental objectives are recent and there is no general consensus on aggregation methods for calculating environmental impact. Many contributing factors have been identified for environmental impacts: impact on humans, ecosystem-terrestrial and aquatic, and local/global temperatures-global warming and ozone depletion, as well as photochemical oxidation, acid rain, and eutrophication. However, reported studies have used one aggregate environmental index as the objective in process design besides one economic objective. Hence, feasibility and usefulness of process optimization for more than two economic and environmental objectives is studied. Two case studies: a VOC (volatile organic component) recovery system and a solvent recovery system are chosen and optimized for both economic and environmental objectives using the elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. The contributing factors to the environmental impacts are optimized individually or grouped into a few indices where appropriate. The objectives chosen for each round of optimization is two, several, or more, with at least one economic and one environmental objective. As they are partially or totally conflicting, Pareto- optimal solutions are obtained. These elucidate the trade-offs present, and the decision maker would be better equipped in choosing the best solution. The net flow method is then used to identify the best Pareto-optimal solution, whereby the decision maker's preference has to be declared. Pareto-optimal solutions and the best Pareto-optimal solution for the two case studies are presented and discussed. Insights gained from considering a number of environmental objectives for process optimization are highlighted. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Aggregation methods; Contributing factor; Decision maker's preferences; Decision makers; Economic criteria; Economic development; Elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Environmental index; Environmental objectives; Environmental stewardship; In-process; Net present; Ozone depletion; Pareto optimal solutions; Payback periods; Photochemical oxidation; Process optimization; Process Variables; Recovery process; Recovery systems; Solvent recovery systems; Volatile organic components; Acid rain; Eutrophication; Global warming; Investments; Optimal systems; Ozone; Ozone layer; Pareto principle; Process control; Process engineering; Research; Volatile organic compounds; Environmental impact",,,,,,"World commission on environment and development (1987) Our Common Future, , Oxford University Press: Oxford; Azapagic, A., Perdan, S., Indicators of sustainable development for industry: A general framework (2000) Process Saf.
