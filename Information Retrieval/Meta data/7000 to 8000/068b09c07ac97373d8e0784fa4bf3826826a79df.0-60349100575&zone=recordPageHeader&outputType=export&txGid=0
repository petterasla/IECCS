Rapid improvements in information technology and strong interest in biodiversity and sustainable ecosystems are driving a vigorous phase of development in ecological databases. Emerging data standards and protocols enable these data to be shared in ways that have previously been difficult. We use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Coastal Assessment (NCA) as an example. The NCA has collected biological, chemical, and physical data from thousands of stations around the U.S. coasts since 1990. NCA data that were collected primarily to assess the ecological condition of the U.S. coasts can be used in innovative ways, such as biogeographical studies to analyze species invasions. NCA application of ecoinformatics tools leads to new possibilities for integrating the hundreds of thousands of NCA species records with other databases to address broad-scale and long-term questions such as environmental impacts, global climate change, and species invasions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Ecoinformatics; Ecological databases; Environmental monitoring; Taxonomic databases; U.S. National Coastal Assessment","Ecoinformatics; Ecological databases; Environmental monitoring; Taxonomic databases; U.S. National Coastal Assessment; Biodiversity; Climate change; Climatology; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental engineering; Environmental management; Environmental Protection Agency; Landforms; Environmental impact; biodiversity; conference proceeding; data management; database; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; sustainability; Animals; Computational Biology; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Models, Biological; Seawater; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; North America; United States",,,,,,"Berendsohn, W.G., Geoffroy, M., Networking taxonomic concepts - Uniting without 'unitary - Ism' (2007) Biodiversity Databases: Techniques, Politics, and Applications, pp. 13-22. , In G.
