This paper analyses the consumption of energy and chemicals by wastewater treatment plants in Oslo over eight years, and their potential environmental impacts. Global warming and acidification were the dominant impacts for chemicals and energy, respectively. Avoided impacts due to usable by-products - sludge, ammonium nitrate and biogas - play a key role in shrinking the environmental footprint of the wastewater plants. The scope for decreasing this footprint by streamlining energy and chemicals consumption is limited, however, considering that over 70% of the impact is accounted for by the eutrophication potential (thanks to the nitrogen and phosphorus which is discharged to the sink) of the treated effluent wastewater. © IWA Publishing 2011.","Acidification; Chemicals; Energy; Environmental impacts; Eutrophication; Global warming; Life cycle environmental analysis; Wastewater treatment plants","Ammonium nitrate; Consumption of energy; Energy; Energy consumption; Environmental footprints; Environmental impact analysis; Treated effluent; Wastewater plants; Wastewater treatment plants; Acidification; Ammonium compounds; Biogas; Chemicals; Effluents; Energy utilization; Eutrophication; Global warming; Life cycle; Phosphorus; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Environmental impact; ammonium nitrate; biogas; nitrogen; phosphorus; acidification; biogas; chemical pollutant; ecological footprint; effluent; energy use; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; global warming; life cycle analysis; nitrate; sludge; wastewater; water treatment; acidification; article; effluent; energy consumption; environmental impact; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; Norway; sludge; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Cities; Conservation of Energy Resources; Environment; Norway; Time Factors; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Norway; Oslo [Norway]",,"ammonium nitrate, 6484-52-2; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"Aasebø, K., (2009), Chief of Water Supply Division, Vann og Avløpsetaten (VAV), Oslo municipality, Oslo.
