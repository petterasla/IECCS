Various treatment methods involving incineration, adsorption, etc., were employed to reduce VOCs concentration. Various absorbents, such as activated carbon, zeolite, silica gel or alumina, and so on were broadly used to adsorb VOCs in various industrial applications. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was handled to analyze the thermal characteristics of absorbents. Typically, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been used to evaluate the structure variation of absorbents under high temperature situations. In view of pollution control and loss prevention, versatility and analysis of recycled adsorbents are necessary and useful for various industrial applications. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Adsorption; Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); Scanning electron microscope (SEM); Thermal characteristics; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs); Zeolite","High temperature; Industrialized nations; Scanning Electron Microscope; Scanning electron microscope (SEM); Scanning electron microscopes; Structure variation; Thermal characteristics; Treatment methods; Absorption; Activated alumina; Activated carbon; Adsorption; Air pollution; Calorimeters; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electron microscopes; Electrons; Gas chromatography; Gelation; Global warming; Incineration; Industrial applications; Loss prevention; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Silica gel; Volatile organic compounds; Zeolites; Scanning",,,,,,"Chen, C.L., Fang, H.Y., Shu, C.M., Source location and characterization of volatile organic compound emissions at a petrochemical plant in Kaohsiung, Taiwan (2005) J Air Waste Manage Assoc, 55, pp. 1487-97; Chen, C.L., Shu, C.M., Fang, H.Y., Location and characterization of VOC emission at a petrochemical plant in Taiwan (2006) Environ Forensics, 7, pp. 1-9; Chen, C.L., Fang, H.Y., Shu, C.M., Mapping and profile of emission sources for airborne volatile organic compounds from process regions at a petrochemical plant in Kaohsiung, Taiwan (2006) J Air Waste Manage Assoc, 56, pp. 824-33; Salden, A., Eigenberger, G., Multifunctional adsorber/reactor concept for waste-air purification (2001) Chem Eng Sci, 56, pp. 1605-11; Breck, D.W., (1974) Zeolite Molecular Sieves-structure, Chemistry and Use, , Wiley New York; Dyer, A., (1988) An Introduction to Zeolite Molecular Sieves, , Wiley New York, USA; Yuranov, I., Renken, A., Kiwi-Minsker, L., Zeolite/sintered metal fibers composites as effective structured catalysts (2005) Appl Catal A, 281, pp. 55-60; Meininghaus, C.K.W., Prins, R., Sorption of volatile organic compounds on hydrophobic zeolites (2000) Micropor Mesopor Mater, 3536, pp. 349-65; Ichiura, H., Nozaki, M., Kitaoka, T., Tanaka, H., Influence of uniformity of zeolite sheets prepared using a papermaking technique on VOC adsorptivity (2003) Adv Environ Res, 7, pp. 975-9; Liao, C.C., Wu, S.H., Su, T.S., Shyu, M.L., Shu, C.M., Thermokinetics evaluation and simulations for the polymerization of styrene in the presence of various inhibitor concentrations (2006) J Therm Anal Calorim, 85 (1), pp. 65-71; Masson, J.F., Bundalo-Perc, S., Calculation of smoothing factors for the comparison of DSC results (2007) J Therm Anal Calorim, 90 (3), pp. 639-43; Chau, J., Garlicka, I., Wolf, C., Teh, J., Modulated DSC as a tool for polyethylene structure characterization (2007) J Therm Anal Calorim, 90 (3), pp. 713-9; Chen, J.R., Wu, S.H., Lin, S.Y., Hou, H.Y., Shu, C.M., Utilization of microcalorimetry for an assessment of the potential for a runaway decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide at low temperatures (2008) J Therm Anal Calorim, 93 (1), pp. 127-33; Wu, S.H., Wang, Y.W., Wu, T.C., Hu, W.N., Shu, C.M., Evaluation of thermal hazards for dicumyl peroxide by DSC and VSP2 (2008) J Therm Anal Calorim, 93 (1), pp. 189-94","Shu, C.-M.; Doctoral Program, Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, 123, University Rd., Sec. 3, Douliou, Yunlin 64002, Taiwan; email: shucm@yuntech.edu.tw",,,,,,,,13886150,,JTACF,,"English","J Therm Anal Calor",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-68349104313
