In order to better link remote sensing information with land plants, and facilitate regional and global climate change studies, the model introduced a simple but important geometrical similarity parameter related to plant crown shapes. The model revealed the influences of different plant crown shapes (such as spherical, cylindrical/cuboidal and conic crowns) on leaf/branch angle distribution frequencies, shadow ground coverage, shadowed or sunlit background fractions, canopy reflectance, and scene reflectance. The modeled reflectance data agreed with the measured ones in the three Leymus chinensis steppes with different degradation degrees, which validated the reflectance model. The lower the degradation degree was, the better the modeled data agreed with the measured data. After this reflectance model was coupled with the optimization inversion method, LAI over the entire study region was estimated once every eight days using the eight-day products of surface reflectance obtained by multi-spectral Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during the growing seasons in 2002. The temporal and spatial patterns of inversed LAI for the steppes with different cover degrees, swamps, flood plains, and croplands agreed with the general laws and measurements very well. But for unused land cover types (sands, saline, and barren lands) and forestlands, totally accounting for about 10% of the study region, the reasonable LAI values were not derived by inversing, requiring further revising of the model or the development of a new model for them. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.","Geometric optics; Geometrical similarity parameter; Inversion; Leaf area index; Plantcrown shape; Radiative transfer; Reflectance model; Semiarid natural grassland","Climate change; Climatology; Degradation; Forestry; Geophysics; Landforms; Laws and legislation; Optical properties; Plants (botany); Radiation; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Geometric optics; Geometrical similarity parameter; Inversion; Leaf area index; Plantcrown shape; Reflectance model; Semiarid natural grassland; Reflection; canopy reflectance; estimation method; grassland; growing season; inverse problem; leaf area index; MODIS; optical property; optimization; radiative transfer; remote sensing; semiarid region; Embryophyta; Leymus chinensis",,,,,,"Sellers, P.J., Schimel, D.S., Remote sensing of the land biosphere and biogeochemistry in the EOS era: Science priorities, methods and implementation - EOS land biosphere and biogeochemical cycles panels (1993) Glob Planet Change, 7, pp. 279-297; Myneni, R.B., Los, S.O., Asrar, G., Potential gross primary productivity of terrestrial vegetation from 1982-1990 (1995) Geophys Res Lett, 22, pp. 2617-2620; Sellers, P.J., Mintz, Y., Sud, Y.C., A simple biosphere model (SiB) for use within general circulation models (1986) J Atmos Sci, 43, pp. 505-531; Ruimy, A., Saugier, B., Dedieu, G., Methodology for the estimation of net primary production from remotely sensed data (1994) J Geophys Res, 99, pp. 5263-5283; Waring, R.H., Running, S.W., (1998) Forest Ecosystems: Analysis at Multiple Scales, , San Diego: Academic Press; Liu, J., Chen, J.M., Cihlar, J., A process-based boreal ecosystem productivity simulator using remote sensing inputs (1997) Remote Sens Environ, 62, pp. 158-175; Zhang, N., Yu, G.R., Yu, Z.L., Simulating leaf area index and biomass at the landscape scale (2003) J Geogr Sci, 13, pp. 139-152; Asrar, G., Myneni, R.B., Li, Y., Measuring and modeling spectral characteristics of a tallgrass prairie (1989) Remote Sens Environ, 27, pp. 143-155; Ganapol, B.D., Myneni, R.B., The FN method for the one-angle radiative transfer equation applied to plant canopies (1992) Remote Sens Environ, 39, pp. 61-74; Privette, J.L., Myneni, R.B., Emery, W.L., Invertibility of a 1D discrete ordinates canopy reflectance model (1994) Remote Sens Environ, 48, pp. 89-105; Myneni, R.B., Impens, I., Asrar, G., Simulation of space measurements of vegetation canopy bidirectional reflectance factors (1993) Remote Sens Rev, 7, pp. 19-41; Myneni, R.B., Asrar, G., Gerstl, S.A.W., Radiative transfer in three dimensional leaf canopies (1990) Trans Theory Stat Phys, 19, pp. 205-250; Myneni, R.B., Modeling radiative transfer and photosynthesis in three dimensional vegetation canopies (1991) Agric For Meteorol, 55, pp. 323-344; Myneni, R.B., Asrar, G., Hall, F.G., A three dimensional radiative transfer method for optical remote sensing of vegetated land surfaces (1992) Remote Sens Environ, 41, pp. 105-121; Li, X., Strahler, A.H., Geometric-optical bidirectional reflectance modeling of the discrete crown vegetation canopy: Effect of crown shape and mutual shadowing (1992) IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens, 30, pp. 276-292; Oker-Blom, P., Lappi, J., Smolander, H., Radiation regime and photosynthesis of coniferous stands (1991) Photon-Vegetation Interactions, pp. 501-535. , In: Myneni R B, Ross J, eds.
