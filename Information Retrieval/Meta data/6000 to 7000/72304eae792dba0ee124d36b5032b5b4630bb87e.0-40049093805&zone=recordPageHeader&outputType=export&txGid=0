Research and development efforts have been focused on developing novel concepts, low-cost systems, and reliable hybrid electric powertrain. This paper reviews the state of the art of electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. The topologies for each category and the enabling technologies are discussed © 2006 IEEE.","Electric drives; Electric machines; Electric vehicle; Fuel cell vehicles; Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); Modeling; Power electronics","Electric machines; Enabling technologies; Fuel cell vehicles; Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); Hybrid-electric powertrains; Low-cost systems; Modeling; Novel concepts; Research and development; State-of-the arts; Stringent regulations; Automobile electronic equipment; Automobile parts and equipment; Electric automobiles; Electric machinery; Electrochemistry; Electronic equipment; Energy resources; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Global warming; Hybrid systems; Laws and legislation; Leakage (fluid); Power electronics; Railroad cars; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Electric drives",,,,,,"Chan, C.C., The state of the art of electric and hybrid vehicles (2002) Proc.
