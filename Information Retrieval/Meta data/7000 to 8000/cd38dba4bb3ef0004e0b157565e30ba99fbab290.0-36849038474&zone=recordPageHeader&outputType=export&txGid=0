We investigated SOC quality in paired hardwood and pine stands growing in coarse textured soils located along a 22 °C gradient in MAT. To do this, we conducted 80-day incubation experiments at 10 and 30 °C to quantify SOC decomposition rates, which we used to kinetically define SOC quality. We used these experiments to test the hypotheses that SOC quality decreases with MAT, and that SOC quality is higher under pine than hardwood tree species. We found that both SOC quantity and quality decreased with increasing MAT. During the 30 °C incubation, temperature sensitivity (Q10) values were strongly and positively related to SOC decomposition rates, indicating that substrate supply can influence temperature responsiveness of SOC decomposition rates. For a limited number of dates, Q10 was negatively related to MAT. Soil chemical properties could not explain observed patterns in soil quality. Soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC) both declined with increasing MAT, and soil C quality was positively related to pH but negatively related to CEC. Clay mineralogy of soils also could not explain patterns of SOC quality as complex (2:1), high CEC clay minerals occurred in cold climate soils while warm climate soils were dominated by simpler (1:1), low CEC clay minerals. While hardwood sites contained more SOC than pine sites, with differences declining with MAT, clay content was also higher in hardwood soils. In contrast, there was no difference in SOC quality between pine and hardwood soils. Overall, these findings indicate that SOC quantity and quality may both decrease in response to global warming, despite long-term changes in soil chemistry and mineralogy that favor decomposition. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Global warming; Labile SOC; Mean annual temperature; Q10; Stable SOC; Temperate forests; Tree species composition","decomposition; ecosystem response; global warming; ion exchange; long-term change; mineralogy; organic carbon; pH; soil organic matter; soil quality; temperature effect; temperature gradient; vegetation; North America",,,,,,"Ågren, G.I., Bosatta, E., Quality: A bridge between theory and experiment in soil organic matter studies (1996) Oikos, 76, pp. 522-528; Bachelet, D., Neilson, R.P., Lenihan, J.M., Drapek, R.J., Climate change effects on vegetation distribution and carbon budget in the United States (2001) Ecosystems, 4, pp. 164-185; Balesdent, J., Mariotti, A., Boisgontier, D., Effect of tillage on soil organic carbon mineralization estimated from 13C abundance in maize fields (1990) Journal of Soil Science, 41, pp. 587-596; Barnhisel, R.I., Bertsch, P.M., Chlorites and hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite and smectite (1989) Minerals in Soil Environments, pp. 729-788. , In: (eds Dixon JB, Weed SB), Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI; Berg, B., Nutrient release from litter and humus in coniferous for estimating soil carbon pools in tropical forest soils -a mini review (1986) Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research, 1, pp. 359-369; Berg, B., Litter decomposition and organic matter turnover in northern forest soils (2000) Forest Ecology and Management, 133, pp. 13-22; Berg, B., Matzner, E., Effect of N deposition on decomposition of plant litter and soil organic matter in forest ecosystems (1997) Environmental Review, 5, pp. 1-25; Berg, B., Meentemeyer, V., Litter quality in a north European transect versus carbon storage potential (2002) Plant and Soil, 242, pp. 83-92; Binkley, D., Giardina, C.P., Why do trees species affect soils?
