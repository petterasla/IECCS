Gradual increases in concentrations occur during long dry spells and sudden large increases are observed during the rising limb of the discharge following dry spells (first flush). By the time the discharge peak has occurred, concentrations are usually decreased, often to levels below those of pre-storm conditions and then they slowly rise again during the next dry spell. These dynamic changes in concentrations and loadings are related to the dissolution of soluble salts and the flushing out of waters that were concentrated by evaporation. The underlying processes, pyrite oxidation and host rock dissolution, do not end until the pyrite is fully weathered, which can take hundreds to thousands of years. These observations can be generalized to predict future conditions caused by droughts related to El Niño and climate change associated with global warming. Already, the time period for dry summers is lengthening in the western US and rainstorms are further apart and more intense when they happen. Consequently, flushing of inactive or active mine sites and mineralized but unmined sites will cause larger sudden increases in concentrations that will be an ever increasing danger to aquatic life with climate change. Higher average concentrations will be observed during longer low-flow periods. Remediation efforts will have to increase the capacity of engineered designs to deal with more extreme conditions, not average conditions of previous years.","Acid mine drainage; Acid rock drainage; Climate change; First flush; Flushing effect","Acid mine drainage; Acid rock drainage; Aquatic life; Dry spells; Dynamic changes; Extreme conditions; First flush; Flushing effect; Host rocks; Mine sites; Mine wastes; Pyrite oxidation; Rainfall events; Time periods; United States; Acids; Climatology; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Dissolution; Drainage; Drought; Global warming; Metal recovery; Mines; Mining; Nickel compounds; Pyrites; Rocks; Storms; Thunderstorms; Climate change; acid deposition; acid mine drainage; climate change; concentration (composition); dissolution; drought; El Nino; evaporation; flushing; future prospect; global warming; mine waste; observational method; rainfall; rainstorm; remediation; North America; United States",,,,,,"Agricola, G., (1556) De Re Metallica [On Metallic Substances].
