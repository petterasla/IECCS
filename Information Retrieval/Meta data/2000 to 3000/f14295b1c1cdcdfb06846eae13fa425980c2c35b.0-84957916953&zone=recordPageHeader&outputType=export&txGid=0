Recent studies, though, have suggested that BC and non-CO2 greenhouse- gas emission controls might slow global warming. Yet, no study has compared the effects, over time, of theoretically reducing BC versus CO2 or CH4 emissions. In this study, a global model was used to compare the effects of such reductions. The model treated eight important feedbacks of aerosols to climate. Results suggest that the most efficient method of controlling global warming over the next 20-50 years, in terms of the magnitude and speed of a cooling, is control of fossil- fuel BC and associated organic matter. It is further shown that late-model diesel vehicles enhance global warming more than do equivalent gasoline vehicles, yet fuel-tax and carbon-tax laws favor diesel in many countries. It is concluded that control strategies for global warming should include control of BC along with control of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.",,,,,,,,,"Jacobson, M.Z.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University Terman Engineering CenterUnited States; email: Jacobson@ce.Stanford.edu","Alexandrov V.N.Dongarra J.J.Juliano B.A.Renner R.S.Kenneth Tan C.J.","American Mathematical Society;et al.;Fujitsu European Center for Information Technology;International Business Machines;Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences;Springer-Verlag","Springer Verlag","International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS 2001","28 May 2001 through 30 May 2001",,129989,03029743,3540422331; 9783540422334,,,"English","Lect.
