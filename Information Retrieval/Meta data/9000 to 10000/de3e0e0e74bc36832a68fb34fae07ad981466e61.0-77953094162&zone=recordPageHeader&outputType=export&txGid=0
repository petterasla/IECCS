Here we compare the climate response to radiative and physiological effects of increased CO2 using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) coupled Community Land and Community Atmosphere Model. In response to a doubling of CO2, the radiative effect of CO2 causes mean surface air temperature over land to increase by 2.86 ± 0.02 K (±1 standard error), whereas the physiological effects of CO2 on land plants alone causes air temperature over land to increase by 0.42 ± 0.02 K. Combined, these two effects cause a land surface warming of 3.33 ± 0.03 K. The radiative effect of doubling CO2 increases global runoff by 5.2 ± 0.6%, primarilyby increasing precipitation over the continents. The physiological effect increases runoff by 8.4 ± 0.6%, primarily by diminishing evapotranspiration from the continents. Combined, these two effects cause a 14.9 ± 0.7% increase in runoff. Relative humidity remains roughly constant in response to CO2-radiative forcing, whereas relative humidity over land decreases in response to CO2-physiological forcing as a result of reduced plant transpiration. Our study points to an emerging consensus that the physiological effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 on land plants will increase global warming beyond that caused by the radiative effects of CO2.","Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Hydrological cycle; Plant stomata; Runoff","carbon dioxide; runoff; air temperature; article; climate change; controlled study; evapotranspiration; futurology; greenhouse effect; humidity; plant; priority journal; radiation; simulation; warming; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Humidity; Plants; Rain; Temperature; Embryophyta",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Field, C., Jackson, R., Mooney, H., Stomatal responses to increased CO2: Implications from the plant to the global scale (1995) Plant Cell Environ, 18, pp. 1214-1255. , doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3040.1995.tb00630.x; Collatz, G.J., Ribas-Carbo, M., Berry, J.A., A coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model for leaves of C4 plants (1992) J Plant Physiol, 19, pp. 519-538; Sellers, P.J., Comparison of radiative and physiological effects of doubled atmospheric CO2 on climate (1996) Science, 271, pp. 1402-1406. , doi: 10.1126/science.271.5254.1402; Hungate, B.A., Evapotranspiration and soil water content in a scrub-oak woodland under carbon dioxide enrichment (2002) Glob Change Biol, 8, pp. 289-298. , doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2486.-2002.00468.x; Long, S.P., Ainsworth, E.A., Leakey, A.D.B., Nosberger, J., Ort, D.R., Food for thought: Lower-than-expected crop yield stimulation with rising CO2 concentrations (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1918-1921. , doi: 10.1126/science.1114722; Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Lee, S.E., Woodward, F.I., Contrasting physiological and structural vegetation feedbacks in climate change simulations (1997) Nature, 387 (6635), pp. 796-799; Cox, P.M., The impact of new land surface physics on the GCM simulation of climate and climate sensitivity (1999) Clim Dynam, 15, pp. 183-203. , doi: 10.1007/s003820050276; Gedney, N., Detection of a direct carbon dioxide effect in continental river runoff records (2006) Nature, 439, pp. 835-838. , doi: 10.1038/nature04504; Betts, R.A., Future runoff changes due to climate and plant responses to increasing carbon dioxide (2007) Nature, 448, pp. 1037-1042. , doi: 10.1038/nature06045; Boucher, O., Jones, A., Betts, R.A., Climate response to the physiological impact of carbon dioxide on plants in the Met Office Unified Model HadCM (2009) Clim Dynam, 32, pp. 237-249. , doi: 10.1007/s00382-008-0459-6; Doutriaux-Boucher, M., Webb, M.J., Gregory, J.M., Boucher, O., Carbon dioxide induced stomatal closure increases radiative forcing via a rapid reduction in low cloud (2009) Geophys Res Lett, 36, pp. L02703. , doi: 10.1029/2008GL036273; Oleson, K.W., Improvements to the community land model and their impact on the hydrological cycle (2008) J Geophys Res, 113, pp. G01021. , doi: 10.1029/2007JG000563; Collins, W.D., Description of the NCAR community atmosphere model (CAM 3. 0), Tech.
