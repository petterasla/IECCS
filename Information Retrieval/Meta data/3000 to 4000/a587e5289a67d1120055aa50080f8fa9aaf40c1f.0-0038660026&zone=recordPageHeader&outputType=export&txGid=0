The detailed lake-level history of the closed Lake Lisan (paleo-Dead Sea) in the Middle East has been reconstructed from shoreline indications and high-resolution U-Th and 14C chronologies, thus providing data on the response of the lake's catchment area to the climate changes during the corresponding period. We present a correlation between the newly developed Lake Lisan level curve for the past 55 k.y. and the North Atlantic Heinrich events. The correlation indicates a closely connected climate response between these North Atlantic events and the hydrologic conditions that prevailed in the Eastern Mediterranean. Our findings show that although the generally cooler conditions that prevailed during the last glaciation favored high levels of the lake, catastrophic events in the North Atlantic, which are associated with maximum cooling, have been responsible for droughts in the Eastern Mediterranean. We infer that cold-water input to the Mediterranean originating in the collapse of the North Atlantic Deep Water circulation caused the reduction of evaporation and less precipitation in the Eastern Mediterranean.","Eastern Mediterranean; Heinrich events; Lake Levels; Lake Lisan; Paleoclimate","Glaciation; Catchments; Climate change; Coastal zones; Drought; Evaporation; Lakes; Precipitation (meteorology); Arid regions; climate oscillation; cooling; Heinrich event; lake level; Last Glacial; oceanic circulation; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; Dead Sea; Middle East",,,,,,"Allen, J.R.M., Brandt, U., Brauer, A., Hubberten, H.W., Huntley, B., Keller, J., Kraml, M., Zolitschka, B., Rapid environmental changes in southern Europe during the last glacial period (1999) Nature, 400, pp. 740-743; Bar-Matthews, M., Ayalon, A., Kaufman, A., Wasserburg, G.J., The Eastern Mediterranean paleoclimate as a reflection of regional events: Soreq cave, Israel (1999) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 166, pp. 85-95; Bartov, Y., Stein, M., Enzel, Y., Agnon, A., Reches, Z., Lake-levels and sequence stratigraphy of Lake Lisan, the late Pleistocene precursor of the Dead Sea (2002) Quaternary Research, 57, pp. 9-21; Bond, G., Lotti, R., Iceberg discharge into the North Atlantic on millennial time scales during the last deglaciation (1995) Science, 267, pp. 1005-1010; Bond, G., Heinrich, H., Broecker, W., Labeyrie, L., McManus, J., Andrews, J., Huon, S., Ivy, S., Evidence for massive discharges of icebergs into the North Atlantic Ocean during the last glacial period (1992) Nature, 360, pp. 245-249; Bond, G., Broecker, W., Johnsen, S., McManus, J., Labeyrie, L., Jouzel, J., Bonani, G., Correlations between climate records from North Atlantic sediments and Greenland ice (1993) Nature, 365, pp. 143-147; Broecker, W.S., Massive iceberg discharges as triggers for global climate change (1994) Nature, 372, pp. 421-424; Cacho, I., Grimalt, J.O., Pelejero, C., Canals, M., Sierro, F.J., Flores, J.A., Shackleton, N., Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich event imprints in Alboran Sea paleotemperatures (1999) Paleoceanography, 14, pp. 698-705; Chapman, M.R., Shackleton, N.J., Duplessy, J.C., Sea surface temperature variability during the last glacial-interglacial cycle: Assessing the magnitude and pattern of climate change in the North Atlantic (2000) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 157, pp. 1-25; Chappell, J.M.A., Shackleton, N.J., Oxygen isotopes and sea level (1986) Nature, 324, pp. 137-138; Clark, P.U., Alley, R.B., Pollard, D., Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet influences on global climate change (1999) Science, 286, pp. 1104-1111; Dansgaard, W., Johnsen, S., Clausen, H.B., Dahl-Jensen, D., Gundestrup, N.S., Hammer, C.U., Hvidberg, C.S., Bond, G., Evidence for general instability of the past climate from a 250-kyr ice core record (1993) Nature, 364, pp. 218-220; Elliot, M., Labeyrie, L., Dokken, T., Manthe, S., Coherent patterns of ice-rafted debris in the Nordic region during the last glacial (10-60 ka) (2001) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 194, pp. 151-163; Florineth, D., Schluchter, C., Alpine evidence for atmospheric circulation patterns in Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum (2000) Quaternary Research, 54, pp. 295-308; Ganopolski, A., Rahmstorf, S., Rapid changes of glacial climate simulated in a coupled climate model (2001) Nature, 409, pp. 153-158; Hazan, N., Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) - Lisan levels (2002) Ohalo: II.
