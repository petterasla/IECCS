For sandy duned coasts, the obvious sedimentation impacts include potential erosion of coastal dunes with implied deposition of the eroded material in the nearshore, possible deepening of embayments, and flooding of wetlands. For the sandy coasts a number of two-dimensional models are available for predicting shoreline change, but there are significant difficulties in applying Bruun-type models for dune erosion and assessment of sediment redistribution over the inner shelf, and for predicting the amount of shoreline retreat for a given rate of sea level rise. If the beach profile contains excessive sand relative to its equilibrium profile, sensu Dean (1991), then shoreline retreat may not occur upon sea level rise. From the evidence of Kiel Bay, at least in these semi-enclosed basin types, it is during major transgressions that maximum deposition in adjacent basins occurs, due to the sea eroding weakly consolidated and weathered surface regolith. But at the same time climatic patterns were re-adjusting and probably contributed to maximum deposition in adjacent shelf and basins below wave base. © Springer-Verlag 1996.","Beach erosion; Kiel Bay; Nearshore sedimentation; Sea level change",,,,,,,"Boesch, D.F., Josselyn, M.N., Mehta, A.J., Morris, J.T., Nuttle, W.K., Simenstad, C.A., Swift, D.J., Scientific assessment of coastal wetland loss, restoration and management in Louisiana (1994) J Coastal Res (Spec Issue), 20, pp. 1-103; Bruun, P., Sea level rise as a cause of shore erosion (1962) J.Waterways Harbors Division, 88, pp. 117-130; Bruun, P., Review of the conditions for use of the Bruun rule or erosion (1983) Coastal Eng, 7, pp. 77-89; Bruun, P., The Bruun Rule of erosion by sea-level rise: A discussion of large-scale two- And three-dimensional usages (1988) J Coastal Res, 4, pp. 627-648; (1989) Guide to the Assessment of the Safety of Dunes as a Sea Defence, 30p. , Report 140, Centre for Civil Engineering Research Codes and Specifications, Rijkswaterstaat and Delft Hydraulics; Dean, R.G., Beach response to sea level change (1990) Ocean Engineering Science, pp. 869-887. , Le Mehaute B, Hanes DM (eds) Wiley, New York; Dean, R.G., Equilibrium beach profiles: Characteristics and applications (1991) J Coastal Res, 7, pp. 53-84; Dean, R.G., Healy, T.R., Dommerholt, A., A ""blind-folded"" test of equilibrium beach profile concepts with New Zealand data (1993) Mar Geol, 109, pp. 253-266; Dott, R.H., An introduction to the ups and downs of eustacy (1992) Geol Soc Am Mem, 180, pp. 1-16. , Dott RH (ed) Eustacy: the historical ups and downs of a major geological concept; Dubois, R.N., Predicting beach erosion as a function of rising water level (1977) J Geol, 85, pp. 470-475; Duphorn, K., The Quaternary history of the Baltic (1979) Symp Univ Uppsala Annum Quingentesimum Celebrantus, 1, pp. 195-206. , The Federal Republic of Germany.
