In situ freezing was imposed using cold nitrogen gas (from a pressurized container of liquid nitrogen) passed through a heat exchanger placed on top of stems and leaves. • Plant water potential, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, and stomatal conductance to water vapor were higher for both species on IR-warmed compared with control plots. For A. tridentata, IR warming caused enhanced tolerance of in situ freezing temperatures. There was no difference in freezing tolerance for E. grandiflorum on control vs IR plots. • These results suggest that some species will not be negatively affected by freezing, whereas others may exhibit enhanced tolerance of subzero air temperatures, under a future warmer climate in which snowmelt occurs earlier in the year. © New Phytologist (2004).","Artemisia tridentata (sagebrush); Chlorophyll a fluorescence; CO2 assimilation; Erythronium grandiflorum; Freezing; Glacier lily; Stomatal conductance; Water potential","climate change; freezing; global warming; photosynthesis; tolerance; Colorado; North America; Rocky Mountains; United States; Artemisia; Artemisia tridentata; Erythronium; Erythronium grandiflorum; Lilium; Tridentata",,,,,,"Alward, R.D., Detling, J.K., Milchunas, D.G., Grassland vegetation changes and nocturnal global warming (1999) Science, 283, pp. 229-231; Bachelet, D., Neilson, R.P., Hickler, T., Drapek, R.J., Lenihan, J.M., Sykes, M.T., Smith, B., Thonicke, K., Simulating past and future dynamics of natural ecosystems in the United States (2003) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 17, p. 1045; Caldwell, M.M., Cold Desert (1985) Physiological Ecology of North American Plant Communities, pp. 198-212. , Chabot B, Mooney H, eds.
