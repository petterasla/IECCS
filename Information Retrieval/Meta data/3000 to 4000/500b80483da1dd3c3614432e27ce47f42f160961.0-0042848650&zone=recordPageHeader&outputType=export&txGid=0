The ice core was analyzed continuously for stable isotopes (δ18O), and major ions throughout the core. Cycles indicated by δ18O, cations were identified and counted as seasonal fluctuations as annual increment from maximum to maximum values. Reconstructed 300-year annual net accumulation (water equivalent) from the core, with a good correlation to Indian monsoon, reflects a major precipitation trend in the central Himalayas. The accumulation trend, separated from the time series, shows a strong negative correlation to Northern Hemisphere temperature. Generally, as northern hemisphere temperature increases 0.1°C, the accumulation decreases about 80 mm, reflecting monsoon rainfall in the central Himalayas has decreased over the past decades in the condition of global warming.",,"climate change; global warming; ice core; monsoon; rainfall; Asia",,,,,,"Barnett, T.P., Dümenil, L., Schlese, U., Roeckner, E., The effect of Eurasian snow cover on global climate (1988) Science, 239, pp. 504-507; Bolzan, J.F., Ice flow at the dome-c ice divide based on a deep temperature profile (1985) J.
