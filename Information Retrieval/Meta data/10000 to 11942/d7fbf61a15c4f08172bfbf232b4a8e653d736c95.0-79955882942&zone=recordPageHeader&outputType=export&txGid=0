Recent changes in the streamflow in the Songhua River are important with regard to local sustainable development and management under the background of global warming and aggravating soil erosion. In order to detect changes in the streamflow, two streamflow series from 1955 to 2004 (observed at the Harbin and Jiamusi stations) in the mainstream of Songhua River basin were obtained, and methods of statistical analysis, wavelet transform, and double mass analysis were employed to analyze the data. Reasons for the changes to the streamflow are discussed with respect to natural and man-made drivers. The results show the following: (1) From 1955 to 2004, the streamflow series present obvious declining trends. (2) The streamflow series followed the pattern of a wet-dry-wet-dry cycle pattern over the past 50 years. In the mainstream of Songhua River, wet years mainly occurred during the periods of 1955-1966 and 1984-1993, while dry years mainly occurred in the 1970s and after 2000. (3) Within the 50-year scale, the streamflow series appeared in the main periods of circa 33-, 13- and 4-year, in which the 33-year periodicity is the strongest. (4) Precipitation and temperature directly influenced the streamflow in the mainstream of the basin. The discharge was positively correlated with the precipitation and negatively correlated with the temperature. In addition, human activity was another important driving factor for streamflow change. (5) In the mainstream of Songhua River basin, the influences on streamflow can be divided into three periods: 1955-1976, 1977-1997, and 1998-2004. In the first period climate change played a dominant role, and during the latter two periods human influences were enhanced significantly. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Climate change; Human activity; Songhua River; Streamflow change","Double mass; Driving factors; Human activities; Human influences; Influencing factor; National development; Natural conditions; Northeast China; Soil erosion; Songhua River; Statistical analysis; Streamflow change; Streamflow changes; Global warming; Metadata; Rivers; Watersheds; Wavelet transforms; Stream flow; climate change; human activity; hydrological cycle; river basin; soil erosion; streamflow; sustainable development; wavelet analysis; China; Songhua Basin; Songhua River",,,,,,"An, G., Sun, L., Lian, Y., Shen, B.Z., The climatic changes analysis of Qian'an in the last 40 years (2002) Clim Environ Res, 7 (3), pp. 370-376; Burn, D.H., Elnur, M.A.H., Detection of hydrologic trends and variability (2002) J Hydrol, 255, pp. 107-122; Chatfield, C., (2004) The Analysis of Time Series, an Introduction, , 6th edn., New York: Chapman & Hall/CRC; Chen, J.S., Xia, X.H., Zhang, L.T., Li, H.B., Relationship between water quality changes in the Yangtze, Yellow and Songhua Rivers and the economic development in the river basins (1999) Acta Sci Circumstant, 19 (5), pp. 500-506; Chen, X.Q., Zong, Y.Q., Zhang, E.F., Xu, J.G., Li, S.J., Human impacts on the Changjiang (Yangtze) River basin, China, with special reference to the impacts on the dry season water discharge into the sea (2001) Geomorphology, 41, pp. 111-123; Dai, S.B., Yang, S.L., Gao, A., Liu, Z., Li, P., Li, M., Trend of sediment flux of main rivers in China in the past 50 years (2007) J Sediment Res, 2, pp. 49-59; Ding, Y.H., Ren, G.Y., Shi, G.Y., National assessment report of climate change (I): climate change in China and its future trend (2006) Adv Clim Change Res, 2 (1), pp. 3-8; Fu, B.J., Wang, Y.F., Lu, Y.H., He, C.S., Chen, L.D., Song, C.J., The effects of land-use combinations on soil erosion: a case study in the Loess Plateau of China (2009) Prog Phys Geogr, 33 (6), pp. 793-804; Guo, J.L., Jing, X.Y., Zhang, J., Wang, Y.B., Zhang, X.M., Ji, J.Z., Fang, L.J., Wang, Y.Q., Prediction, assessment and countermeasures against flood in master stream of Songhua River (2004) J Nat Disasters, 13 (4), pp. 37-44; Hu, D., Saito, Y., Kempe, S., Sediment and nutrient transport to the coastal zone (1998) Asian Change in the Context of Global Climate Change: Impact of Natural and Anthropogenic Changes in Asia on Global Biogeochemical Cycles.
