Greenhouse-gas emissions (CO2 and CFCs) from motor vehicles in developing countries contribute less than 3% to the global greenhouse effect, compared to a 9 to 12% contribution from motor vehicles in OECD countries and Eastern Europe. The share of OECD countries in conventional pollutant emissions from motor vehicles exceeds the combined contribution of all developing countries by a factor of three to five. Acid deposition from motor vehicle emissions does not currently appear to be a problem in developing countries. The incidence of regional scale ozone is not known but could be potentially significant downstream from large urban centers. There is a need for more systematic monitoring and evaluation of acid deposition and regional ozone concentrations in developing countries. Urban air quality is the prime casualty of motorization in developing countries. The air pollution problem will intensify in developing countries with increasing urbanization and the rapid pace of motorization. Urban concentrations of carbon monoxide, airborne lead, particulate matter and sulfur oxides in many developing countries already exceed the levels in industrialized countries. Motor vehicles emit 30% to 85% of all man-made air pollutants in the large urban areas in developing countries, depending on the level of motorization. Without effective measures to control pollutant emissions, some 300 to 500 million city dwellers in developing countries will become exposed to unhealthy and dangerous levels of air pollution from motor vehicles by the year 2000. © 1993.",,"acid deposition; air pollution; air quality; automobile pollution; automobiles; developing countries; developing country; global warming; greenhouse effect; motor vehicle emission; motor vehicle emissions; ozone; pollution problem; urban air quality; urban area",,,,,,"Allport, (1990) Transport and Air Pollution in Asia, , Halcrow Fox and Associates, Transportation Consultants, London, Report prepared for the Technical Department, Asia Region, World Bank; An Foras Forbarthon, (1985) The state of the environment, , Dublin; Bureau of Air Pollution Control, (1987) 1986 Air Quality Report, , Phoenix, Maricopa Country, Arizona; CADE-IDEPE, (1989) Universo de Fuentes Emisoras de Contaminantes Atmosphericos e Inventario Real de Emissiones para Santiago, , Intendencia Region Metropolitano, Santiago, Chile; Centraal Bureau Voor de Statistien, (1990) Kwartaalbricht Milieustatistieken Nederland, , Voorburg, Netherlands; CETESB, (1985) Air Pollution Control Program and Strategies in Brazil, , Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Daniels, (1990) The Motor Industry and the Environment, , The Economist Intelligence Unit, London, Special Report; 2066; Departamento del Distrito Federal, Air Pollution Control in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (1990) Phase 1 Results for the Short Term Program (Draft Report), , Mexico City (October); Economic Commission for Europe, The state of transboundary air pollution, 1989 update (1990) Air Pollution Studies, 6. , United Nations, New York; ECMT, Transport policy and the environment (1990) European Conference of Ministers of Transport Ministerial Session, , OECD, Paris; Environment Canada, (1990) Canadian Perspectives on Air Pollution, , Environment Canada, Ottawa, SOE Report; 90-1; Espert, Juame, Perez, Garcia-serra, A gaussian air pollution dispersion model for the city of Valencia.
