It contains provisions for including carbon stock changes from forests and land-use change to meet nations' greenhouse gas commitments, but the terms under which forest-related carbon stock changes are included are open to interpretation. Critical questions include how much of the carbon currently being sequestered by US forests might qualify, and what forest management activities will be included.The international agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol seeks to reduce the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases to mitigate the threat of global climate change. It contains provisions for including carbon stock changes from forests and land-use change to meet nations' greenhouse gas commitments, but the terms under which forest-related carbon stock changes are included are open to interpretation. Critical questions include how much of the carbon currently being sequestered by US forests might qualify, and what forest management activities will be included.In 1997, more than 150 countries negotiated and signed the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which seeks to reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Under the agreement, countries can meet their reduction targets for greenhouse gases either by reducing emission sources or by enhancing terrestrial carbon sinks through land use, land-use change, or forestry. The paper examines the difficulties of determining the specific terms under which forest-related carbon stock changes may qualify under the protocol. Critical questions include how much of the carbon currently sequestered by a country's forests will be counted and which forest management activities will be included. The answers will depend on which definitions will be adopted for forests, afforestation, deforestation, and reforestation, and on the rules that will be established for carbon accounting and for measuring carbon stock changes. Possible implications for US forests are discussed.",,"Atmospheric concentration; Forest management; Greenhouse gases; Atmospheric composition; Carbon; Ecosystems; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; Forestry; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; forest management; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; United States",,,,,,"Birdsey, R.A., Heath, L.S., Carbon changes in US forests (1995) Productivity of America's Forests and Climate Change, pp. 56-70. , ed.
