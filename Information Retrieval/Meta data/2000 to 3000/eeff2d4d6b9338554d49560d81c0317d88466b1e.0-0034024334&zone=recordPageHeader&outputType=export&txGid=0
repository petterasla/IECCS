"Ni J.","A simulation of Biomes on the Tibetan Plateau and their responses to global climate change",2000,"Mountain Research and Development","20","1",,"80","89",,,,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0034024334&partnerID=40&md5=ee9116f6f083bc083ebcb5292514f859",,"Ni, J.","The improved process-based equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model (BIOME3China) was run under the present climate to model the potential biomes on the Tibetan Plateau on a 10' grid. The simulated biome was basically in good agreement with a potential natural vegetation map based on a numerical comparison between two maps using the ΔV statistic (ΔV = 0.38). A coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model including sulfate aerosols was used to drive a double greenhouse gas scenario to the end of the next century. The simulated vegetation under changed climate with a CO 2 concentration of 500 ppmv and a baseline biome map were also compared using the ΔV statistic (ΔV = 0.4). The climate change would cause a large reduction in the temperate desert, alpine steppe, desert, and ice/polar desert, a large increase in the cold-temperate conifer forest, temperate shrubland/meadow, and temperate steppe, and a general northwestward shift of all vegetation zones. In addition to simulation of biome distribution, BIOME3China also predicted net primary production (NPP) of each grid cell. Comparisons between predicted annual NPP and 160 forest NPP measurements show an agreement between them with a linear regression, despite many problems, such as the quality of the field data. The pattern of predicted annual NPP in the scenario with enhanced CO 2 concentration was the same as that under the present climate; however, the NPP of each biome would increase significantly. Present permafrost simulated using the air frost index was quite similar to the actual frozen ground distribution on the Tibetan Plateau. After the change in climate, the boundary between continuous and discontinuous permafrost would shift toward the north of the plateau by about 1-2°in latitude. The continuous permafrost would mostly disappear, whereas the no-permafrost area would greatly increase. The movement of permafrost would take place with the shift of vegetation zones to the north. The disappearance of permafrost and the expansion of no-permafrost areas would accelerate the desertification of the Tibetan Plateau.","Biome simulation; Response to global climate change; Terrestrial system modeling; Tibetan Plateau","biome; climate change; global change; modeling; China; Coniferophyta",,,,,,"Anislmov, O.A., Nelson, F.E., Permafrost distribution in the Northern Hemisphere under scenarios of climate change (1996) Global and Planetary Change, 14, pp. 59-72; (1984) Climatological Data of China, , Beijing: Meteorology Press of China; (1980) Vegetation of China, , Beijing: Science Press; Foley, J.A., Prentice, I.C., Ramankutty, N., Levis, S., Pollard, D., Sitch, S., Haxeltine, A., An integrated biosphere model of land surface processes, terrestrial carbon balance, and vegetation dynamics (1996) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 10, pp. 603-628; Haslett, J.R., Mountain ecology: Organism responses to environmental change, an introduction (1997) Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters, 6, pp. 3-6; Haxeltlne, A., Prentice, I.C., BIOME3: An equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model based on ecophysiological constraints, resource availability and competition among plant functional types (1996) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 10, pp. 693-709; Hou, X.Y., Sun, S.Z., Zhang, J.W., He, M.G., Wang, Y.F., Kong, D.Z., Wang, S.Q., (1982) Vegetation Map of the People's Republic of China, , Beijing: Map Press of China; Hutchinson, M.F., A new objective method for spatial interpolation of meteorological variables from irregular networks applied to the estimation of monthly mean solar radiation, temperature, precipitation and windrun (1989) Need for Climatic and Hydrologic Data in Agriculture in Southeast Asia, , Canberra: CSIRO; (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Johns, T.C., Carnell, R.E., Gregory, J.F., Gregory, J.M., Mitchell, J.F.B., Senior, C.A., Tett, S.F.B., Wood, K.A., The second Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM: Model description, spinup and validation (1997) Climate Dynamics, 13, pp. 103-134; Liu, X.D., Zhang, M.F., Hui, X.Y., Kang, X.C., Contemporary climatic change of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and its response to greenhouse effect (1998) Scientia Geographica Sinica, 18, pp. 113-121; McGuire, A.D., Melillo, J.M., Kicklighter, D.W., Pan, Y., Xiao, X., Helfrlch, J., Moore III, B., Schloss, A.L., Equilibrium responses of global net primary production and carbon storage to doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide: Sensitivity to changes in vegetation nitrogen concentration (1997) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 11, pp. 173-189; Melillo, J.M., McGuire, A.D., Kicklighter, D.W., Moore III, B., Vorosmarty, C.J., Schloss, A.L., Global climate change and terrestrial net primary production (1993) Nature, 363, pp. 234-240; Melillo, J., Prentice, I.C., Schulze, E.-D., Farquhar, G., Sala, O., Terrestrial biotic responses to environmental change and feedbacks to climate (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, pp. 445-482. , Houghton JT, Meira Filho LG, Callender BA, Harris N, Kattenberg A, Maskell K, editors.
