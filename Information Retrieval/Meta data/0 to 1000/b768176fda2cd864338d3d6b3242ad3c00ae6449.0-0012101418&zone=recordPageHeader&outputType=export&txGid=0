Following Nature's example, carbon dioxide should not be regarded as a waste, but as a resource from which useful products can be made. Highly concentrated, calcium-rich brines are commonly found associated with subsurface salt deposits. By bringing together the energy and chemical industries, it may be possible to use these brines to lock up carbon dioxide, while at the same time producing calcium carbonate, hydrochloric acid and a variety of other chemical-industrial commodities. © 1992.","calcium-rich brines; carbon dioxide capture; chemicals from brines; Global warming; precipitated calcium carbonate",,,,,,,"Berner, Lasaga, Modeling the geochemical carbon cycle (1989) Scientific American, pp. 74-81. , Mar. 1989; François, Walker, Modelling the Phanerozoic carbon cycle and climate: constraints from the 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio of seawater (1992) American Journal of Science, 292, pp. 81-135; Holland, (1978) The Chemistry of the Atmosphere and Oceans, , Wiley, New York; Lipinsky, R&D Status of Carbon Dioxide Separation (1991) Disposal and Utilization Technologies, , Unpubl.
