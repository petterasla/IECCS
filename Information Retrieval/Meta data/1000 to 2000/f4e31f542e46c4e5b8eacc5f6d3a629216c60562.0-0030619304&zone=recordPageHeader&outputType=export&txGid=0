Yet it is unclear whether the prospect of such change is relevant to water resources management decisions being made today. We model a shoreline protection decision problem with a stochastic dynamic program (SDP) to determine whether consideration of the possibility of climate change would alter the decision. Three questions are addressed with the SDP: (1) How important is climate change compared to other uncertainties?, (2) What is the economic loss if climate change uncertainty is ignored?, and (3) How does belief in climate change affect the timing of the decision? In the case study, sensitivity analysis shows that uncertainty in real discount rates has a stronger effect upon the decision than belief in climate change. Nevertheless, a strong belief in climate change makes the shoreline protection project less attractive and often alters the decision to build it.",,"Climate models; Decision making; Decision theory; Global warming; Losses; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Water resources; Decision problems; Discount rates; Economic loss; Resource distribution; Shoreline protection; Stochastic dynamic program; Water resources management; Climate change; climate; coastal protection; general circulation models; climate change; coastal protection; decision support system; management implication; shoreline protection; stochastic model; water management",,,,,,"Chao, P.T., (1996) Analysis of the Impact of Climate Change Uncertainty Upon Shoreline Management Decisions, , Ph.D. thesis, Dep. of Syst., Control, and Ind.
