The apparent quantum use efficiency (α) of alpine meadow was derived based on the linear function between NEE and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) under low light. A model driven by the main ecological factors, such as temperature, CO2 concentration was further adapted for α modeling at stand level. The key parameter of this model was the maximum apparent quantum use efficiency (α0), which could be inversed with the model. As a parameter for the growth status of a plant community, α0 changed in accord with leaf area index (LAI), and the maximum for alpine meadow was about 0.016 μmol CO2 μmol-1 PAR. If considered by the soil moisture (θ), α0 was linearly correlated with θ when the soil moisture was lower than 0.2 m3 m-3, and α0 leveled off gradually when θ was higher than 0.2 m3 m-3. This model provides a method to simulate α at stand level and can be applicable to different communities. When the CO2 concentration is double in the future, the α of alpine meadow will increase by 7%, and the tendency might be strengthened by the global warming. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
