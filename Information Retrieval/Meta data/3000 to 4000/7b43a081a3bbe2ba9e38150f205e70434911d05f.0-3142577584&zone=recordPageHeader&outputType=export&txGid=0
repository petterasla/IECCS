The functional unit was defined as one animal, and the stages associated with the beef-fattening life cycle, such as feed (concentrate and rough-age) production, feed transport, animal management, animal body (i.e., biological activity of cattle), and the treatment of cattle wastes, were included in the system boundary. Our results suggest that enteric or gut CH 4 emissions of cattle were the major source in the impact category of global warming (2,851 kg of CO 2 equivalents), whereas NH 3 emissions from cattle waste were the major source in the impact categories of acidification (35.1 kg of SO 2 equivalents) and eutrophication (6.16 kg of PO 4 equivalents). Feed production also contributed a great deal to all categories. A shorter feeding length resulted in lower environmental impacts in all the environmental impact categories examined in the current study, such as global warming and acidification, although there was a difference in effect of reducing environmental impacts among the categories. ©2004 American Society of Animal Science.
