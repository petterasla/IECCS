Three management options are considered: do nothing; construct a dike that removes hydrological connections with the lake ('closed dike'); and build a dike that maintains a hydrological connection with the lake, but can be converted to a closed dike under adverse conditions ('open dike'). For all practical purposes, dike construction represents an irreversible choice. The model, a stochastic dynamic program, is used to optimize the timing and type of protective structure under a range of management goals. A wetland can either be optimal for fish or optimal for mammals and waterfowl, but not both. Because credible estimates of the economic values of wetland services do not exist, we treat those values as parameters in a multiobjective analysis and show the decisions implied by alternative valuations. The model is applied to the case of Metzger Marsh, a Lake Erie coastal wetland near Toledo, Ohio, where the decision was made in 1993 to construct an open dike. We find that the optimal decision is robust with respect to varying assumptions about the formation of barrier beaches and the probability of climate change, but that the decision is not robust to assumptions concerning the health of an unprotected Metzger Marsh. The most important source of uncertainty is the biological health of an unprotected wetland.","Climate change; Dynamic program; Wetlands management","lacustrine environment; restoration ecology; uncertainty role; wetland management; article; ecosystem; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; lake; seashore; stochastic model; United States; United States",,,,,,"Ang, H.-S., Tang, W.H., (1984) Probability Concepts in Engineering Planning and Design, , Wiley, New York; Bloczynski, J., (1996) Analysis of Great Lakes Wetland Management under Global Warming Uncertainty: a Dynamic Programming Approach, , M.S. thesis, Department of Systems, Control, and Industrial Engineering, Case Western Reserve University; Chao, P.T., Hobbs, B.F., Decision analysis of shoreline protection under climate change uncertainty (1997) Water Resources Research, 33, pp. 817-829; Clemen, R.T., (1996) Making Hard Decisions: An Introduction to Decision Analysis, 2d Ed., , Duxbury Press, Belmont, CA; Dixit, A., Pindyck, R.S., (1994) Investment under Uncertainty, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Dyer, J., Sarin, R.K., Measurable multiattribute value functions (1979) Operations Research, 27, pp. 810-822; Hartmann, H.C., Climate change impacts on laurential great lakes levels (1990) Climatic Change, 17, pp. 49-67; Herdendorf, C.E., (1987) The Ecology of the Coastal Marshes of Western Lake Erie: a Community Profile, , US Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC; Herdendorf, C.E., Lake erie coastal wetlands: An overview (1992) Journal of Great Lakes Research, 18, pp. 533-551; Herdendorf, C.E., Krieger, K.A., Overview of lake erie and its estuaries within the great lakes ecosystem (1988) Proceedings of An Estuary-of-the-month Seminar, 4 May 1988, , K.
