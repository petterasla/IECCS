With known costs and benefits of control, tax and limit policies are equivalent, and either is better than a cumulative limit policy. With uncertain benefits of emission reduction, tax and limit policies are equivalent. However, with uncertain costs of emission reduction, a tax policy may be better. A cumulative limit policy may occasionally perform well under uncertainty, but this is not generally the case. © 1993.","Economic assessment; Global warming; Policy instruments","carbon dioxide; climatic change; economic assessment; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; limit policy; tax policy; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Performance; Public policy; Taxation; Carbon dioxide emission control; Cumulative limit policy; Economic assessment; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Limit policy; Policy instrument; Tax policy; Air pollution control",,,,,,"Kosobud, Daly, Quinn, (1991) Tradeable Permits for Global Warming Control: Implications for Regional Economies and Public Utilities, , Draft, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439; Peck, Teisberg, (1993) The Importance of Non-Linearities in Global Warming Damage Costs, , Most of the model description here draws heavily from the description in, Resources for the Future, Washington, DC, forthcoming; Peck, Teisberg, CETA a model for carbon emissions trajectory assessment (1992) The Energy Journal, 13 (1), pp. 55-77; Manne, Richels, (1992) Buying Greenhouse Insurance: The Economic Costs of CO2 Emission Limits, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Energy Modeling Forum, (1991) Study Design for EMF 12 Global Climate Change: Energy Sector Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emission Control Strategies, , Draft, Stanford University Energy Modeling Forum; Fulkerson, Judkins, Sanghvi, Energy from fossil fuels (1990) Scientific American, pp. 128-135. , The EMF study did not specify a total world coal resource base.
