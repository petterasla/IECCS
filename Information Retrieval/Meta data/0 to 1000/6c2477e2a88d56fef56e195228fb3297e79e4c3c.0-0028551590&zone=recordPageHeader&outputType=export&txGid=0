The main challenges are population pressure, land degradation, environmental pollution, global climate change, non-agricultural activities, market uncertainty, low level of capital investment, and some policy and behavioural conditions. However, there are opportunities related to natural resources, labour, education, science and technology, and some models of sustainable farming which already exist. © 1994.",,"agricultural production; agricultural sustainability; developing country; future prospect; sustainable agriculture; China",,,,,,"BANRC (Board on Agriculture, National Research Council), (1989) Alternative Agriculture, , National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Brown, Hanson, Merideth, Jr., Global sustainability: toward definition (1987) Environ.
