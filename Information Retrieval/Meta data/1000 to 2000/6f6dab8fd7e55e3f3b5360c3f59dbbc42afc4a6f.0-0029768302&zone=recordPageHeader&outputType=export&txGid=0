The Pliocene data base is sufficiently complete to provide a valuable test for climate model predictions for warm time periods. This paper reviews some key issues with respect to understanding and verifying theories for the origin of Pliocene warmth. There are two main factors cited to explain Pliocene warmth-higher CO2 levels or higher levels of ocean heat transport. The two explanations may not be exclusive; for example CO2 increases may drive ocean heat transport changes. However, initial proxy-CO2 reconstructions suggest that the CO2 perturbation is very small (∼ 100 ppm) to effect such large changes in climate. Considerably more data are needed to evaluate the magnitude of Pliocene CO2 changes. Although more modeling work is also required, it is necessary to continue evaluation of input data used to force model results (particularly sea surface temperatures). Continued simulations and evaluation of pCO2 and SST results should enable us to better understand how the earth responds during a global warming and determine whether our models are properly simulating such changes. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.
