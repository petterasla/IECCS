But, when examining in more detail the possible criteria for distributions of CO2 entitlements - such as grandfathering or distribution per capita - it appears that an international agreement on the implementation of the entitlement system without introductory measures is quite improbable. The most important criterion that will determine whether such a distribution key will indeed be accepted is neglected, that is, the willingness to pay. Much has been written about the structures and theoretical advantages of joint implementation and tradeable permits. But greenhouse gas emission reductions achievable with joint implementation as a single instrument will not be sufficient to protect the earth's atmosphere. At the same time, a system of tradeable emission entitlements is unlikely to be established. This article suggests introducing the system of tradeable CO2 emission entitlements gradually, using stages of joint implementation in a stepwise manner. Using joint implementation to enter an entitlement system allows industrialized countries to adapt their self-defined emission quotas to their willingness to pay. The narrower the target, the higher the costs will be to avoid emissions in one's own country or elsewhere. The net-payers establish the level to which their emissions may rise without interferences, and the net-recipients distribute the available emission rights among themselves according to other criteria. Such a differentiation of target definitions may not completely eliminate the difficulties of finding a consensus, but at least may reduce them.",,"carbon emissions; emissions entitlement; environmental economics; global warming; international agreement; joint implementation; tradable permit; willingness to pay",,,,,,"Grubb, M., Options for An International Agreement (1992) Combating Global Warming: Study on A Global System of Tradeable Emission Entitlements, p. 19. , UNCTAD/RDP/DFP/1 New York: UNCTAD; Rentz, H., (1995) Kompensationen im Klimaschutz.
