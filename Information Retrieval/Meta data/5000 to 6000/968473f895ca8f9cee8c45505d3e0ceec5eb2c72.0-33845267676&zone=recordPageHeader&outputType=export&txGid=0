Thermal model output indicated that surface water temperatures were influenced primarily by atmospheric conditions, but the release of warmer water over the spillway resulted in a thinner epilimnion and cooler metalimnetic water temperatures. Ecological model predictions indicated that spillway releases and associated temperatures resulted in lower growth rates for young-of-year (YOY) kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the reservoir by up to 9 percent when compared with growth rates under baseline operations with no releases over the spillway. Kokanee growth rates were reduced under spillway release scenarios because lower temperatures not only affected metabolic rates, but limited the productivity of the zooplankton as well. Thus, altering the release regime with spillway discharges could have deleterious effects on Blue Mesa's YOY kokanee. However, in other reservoirs, distributing discharges among different elevations may provide managers with a mechanism to regulate temperatures to benefit species of concern that are facing challenges imposed by environmental conditions such as global warming.","Bioenergetics; CE-THERM; Dam operations; Oncorhynchus nerka; Reservoir thermal structure; Simulation; Temperature","Computer simulation; Ecology; Flow of fluids; Mathematical models; Reservoirs (water); Thermal effects; Bioenergetics; Dam operations; Oncorhynchus nerka; Reservoir thermal structure; Spillways; Computer simulation; Ecology; Flow of fluids; Mathematical models; Reservoirs (water); Spillways; Thermal effects; bioenergetics; dam; growth rate; reservoir; salmonid; simulation; spillway; surface water; thermal structure; water temperature; Blue Mesa Reservoir; Colorado; North America; United States; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus nerka",,,,,,"Barbiero, R.P., James, W.F., Barko, J.W., The effects of a change in withdrawal operations on phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics in Eau Galle Reservoir, Wisconsin (USA) (1997) Int.
