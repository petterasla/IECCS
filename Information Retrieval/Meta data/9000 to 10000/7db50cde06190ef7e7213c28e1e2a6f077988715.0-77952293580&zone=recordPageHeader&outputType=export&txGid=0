However, studies on the effects of topography on soil aggregation and SOC dynamics, especially after the implementation of vegetation restoration, are rare. Poorly understood mechanisms and a lack of quantification for the suite of ecological benefits brought by the impacts of topography after planting further obstructed our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) sequestration. The purposes of this study are to (1) quantify the impacts of vegetation restoration on size and stability of soil aggregates and the sequestration of C in soil and (2) to address the impacts of various slope locations on aggregates and SOC distribution. Materials and methods: The experimental sites were set up in 1959 on a highly disturbed barren land in a tropical and coastal area of Guangdong province in South China. One site received human-induced vegetation restoration (the restored site), while the other received no planting and has remained as barren land (the barren site). The soil in the study sites was a latosol developed from granite. Soil samples were taken from 0 to 20 and 20 to 40 cm soil layer at shoulder and toe slope positions at both sites for comparisons. Soils were analyzed for proportion of soil macroaggregates (&gt;0. 25 mm), the SOC in soil layers, and the aggregate soil organic carbon (AOC) at different aggregate sizes. Results and discussion: Measurements in 2007 showed that fractions of water stable macroaggregates in 0-40 cm at shoulder and toe slope ranged from 28% to 45%, about one third to one half of those of dry macroaggregates (91-95%) at the restored site. Soil macroaggregates were not detected at barren site in 2007. Average SOC storage in 0-40 cm soil layer of shoulder and toe slope positions at the restored site was 56. 5 ± 10. 9 Mg C ha-1, about 2. 4 times of that (23. 4 ± 4. 6 Mg C ha-1) at barren site in 2007. Since 1959, the soil aggregation and SOC storage are significantly improved at the restored site; opposite to that, soil physical and chemical quality has remained low on the barren land without planting. SOC storage in 0-40 cm at toe slope was 15. 9 ± 1. 8 Mg C ha-1, which is only half of that (30. 9 ± 9 Mg C ha-1) at shoulder slope of the barren site; this is opposite to the pattern found at restored site. The ratios of AOC in 0-20 cm to AOC in 20-40 cm at toe slope were lower than those at shoulder slope of the restored site. The comparison of organic carbon sequestered in soils at different slope positions suggest that soil aggregates played a role in sequestering C based upon landscape positions and soil profile depth as a consequence of soil erosion and deposition. Conclusions: Results indicate that vegetation restoration and SOC accumulation significantly enhance soil aggregation, which in turn promotes further organic C accumulation in the aggregates via physical protection. Soil aggregation and soil C accumulation differed between slope positions. Soil aggregation was significantly enhanced in 0-20 cm layer and aggregates absorb C into deep layers in depositional environment (toe slope) under protection from human disturbances. The interactions of erosion-deposition, soil aggregates, and vegetation restoration play important roles on SOC accumulation and redistribution on land. Recommendations and perspectives: The positive feedback between SOC and soil aggregates should be evaluated for improving the quantification of the impacts of land use change, erosion, and deposition on the dynamics of SOC and soil structure under the global climate change. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Aggregate soil organic carbon; Deposition; Erosion; Soil aggregation; Soil organic carbon; Vegetation restoration","accumulation; carbon sequestration; coastal zone; deposition; granite; land use change; restoration ecology; slope; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil organic matter; soil structure; terrestrial ecosystem; tropical region; vegetation type; China; Guangdong",,,,,,"Andrew, W., Conaway, J.R., Strickling, E., A comparison of selected methods for expressing soil aggregate stability (1962) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 26, pp. 426-430; Beare, M.H., Cabrera, M.L., Hendrix, P.F., Coleman, D.C., Aggregate-protected and unprotected organic matter pools in conventional- and no-tillage soils (1994) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 58, pp. 787-795; Berhe, A.A., Harte, J., Harden, J.W., Torn, M.S., The significance of the erosion-induced terrestrial carbon sink (2007) BioScience, 57, pp. 337-346; Bossuyt, H., Six, J., Hendrix, P.F., Aggregate-protected carbon in no-tillage and conventional tillage agro-ecosystems using carbon-14 labeled plant residue (2002) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 66, pp. 1965-1973; Elliott, E.T., Aggregate structure and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in native and cultivated soils (1986) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 50, pp. 518-524; Eynard, A., Schumacher, T.E., Lindstrom, M.J., Malo, D.D., Kohl, R.A., Effects of aggregate structure and organic C on wettability of Ustolls (2006) Soil Tillage Res, 88, pp. 205-216; Fornara, D.A., Tilman, D., Plant functional composition influences rates of soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation (2008) J Ecol, 9, pp. 314-322; Fox, D.M., Le Bissonnais, Y., Process-based analysis of aggregate stability effects on sealing, infiltration, and inter-rill erosion (1998) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 62, pp. 717-724; Greenland, D.J., Lindstrom, G.R., Quirk, J.P., Organic materials which stabilize natural soil aggregates (1962) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 26, pp. 366-371; He, Y., Xu, Z.H., Chen, C.R., Burton, J., Ma, Q., Ge, Y., Xu, J.M., Using light fraction and macroaggregate associated organic matters as early indicators for management-induced changes in soil chemical and biological properties in adjacent native and plantation forests of subtropical Australia (2008) Geoderma, 147, pp. 116-125; He, Y., Chen, C.R., Xu, Z.H., Williams, D., Xu, J.M., Assessing management impacts on soil organic matter quality in subtropical Australian forests using physical and chemical fractionation as well as 13C NMR spectroscopy (2009) Soil Biol Biochem, 41, pp. 640-650; Imeson, A.C., Geomorphological processes, soil structure and ecology (1985) Geomorphology: Themes and Trends, pp. 72-84. , A.
