In this study, non-azeotropic mixtures composed of HFOs (HFO-1234yf, HFO-1234ze(z), HFO-1234ze(e) and HFO-1234zf) are developed to substitute for HFC-134a and CFC-114 in air-conditioning and high-temperature heat pump systems, respectively. The cycle performances were evaluated by an improved theoretical cycle evaluation methodology. The results showed that all the mixtures proposed herein were favorable refrigerants with excellent thermodynamic cycle performances. M1A presented lower discharge temperature and pressure ratio and higher COP c than that of HFC-134a. The volumetric cooling capacity was similar to HFC-134a. It can be served as a good environmentally friendly alternative to replace HFC-134a. M3H delivered similar discharge temperature as CFC-114 did. And the COP h was 3% higher. It exhibits excellent cycle performance in high-temperature heat pump and is a promising refrigerant to substitute for CFC-114. And the gliding temperature differences enable them to exhibit better coefficient of performance by matching the sink/source temperature in practice. Because the toxicity, flammability and other properties are not investigated in detail, extensive toxicity and flammability testing needs to be conducted before they are used in a particular application. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","air-conditioning system; high-temperature heat pump; hydrofluoro-olefin; non-azeotropic mixtures; refrigerant","Airconditioning systems; Coefficient of Performance; Cycle performance; Discharge temperature; Environmental concerns; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Evaluation methodologies; Gliding temperature; HFC-134A; High temperature heat pump; Non-azeotropic mixture; non-azeotropic mixtures; Pressure ratio; Thermodynamic cycle performance; Volumetric cooling capacities; Air conditioning; Cooling systems; Flammability testing; Global warming; Hafnium compounds; Heat pump systems; Mixtures; Olefins; Pumps; Refrigerants; Toxicity; Temperature",,,,,,"Warren, B., (2007) Industry Update on Refrigerants, , Emerson Company Webinar; Directive 2006/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EC (2006) Official Journal of the European Union, , September 18, 2008; Brown, J.S., Ziliob, C., Cavallini, A., Thermodynamic properties of eight fluorinated olefins (2009) Int J Refrig, , doi: 10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2009.04.005; Spatz, M., Minor, B., HFO-1234yf low GWP refrigerant update (2008) Proceedings of the International Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Conference at Purdue, , West Lafayette, Indiana, USA; Thomas, J.L., Evaluation of HFO-1234yf as a potential replacement for R-134a in refrigeration applications (2009) 3rd IIR Conference on Thermophysical Properties and Transfer Processes of Refrigerants, , America; Park, K.J., Jung, D., Nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficients of r1234yf on plain and low fin surfaces (2009) Int J Refrig, , doi: 10.1016/j.ijrefrig; Mark, W.S., Update on a low GWP refrigerant fluid H (2007) SAE 2007 Alternatives Refrigerant Systems Symposium, , America; Calm, J.M., The next generation of refrigerants-Historical review, considerations, and outlook (2008) Int J Refrig, 31, pp. 1123-1133. , 10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2008.01.013; Brown, J.S., Ziliob, C., Cavallini, A., The fluorinated olefin R-1234ze(Z) as a high-temperature heat pumping refrigerant (2009) Int J Refrig, 32, pp. 1412-1422. , 10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2009.03.002; Brown, J.S., HFOs new, low global warming potential refrigerants (2009) ASHRAE J, 51 (8), pp. 22-29; Stoecker, W.F., Internal performance of a refrigerant mixture in a two-evaporator refrigerator (1985) ASHRAE Trans, 91, pp. 241-249; Yilmaz, M., Performance analysis of a vapor compression heat pump using nonazeotropic refrigerant mixtures (2003) Energy Convers Manage, 44, pp. 267-282. , 10.1016/S0196-8904(02)00054-7; Smit, F.J., Meyer, J.P., Investigation of the potential effect of zeotropic refrigerant mixture on performance of a hot-water heat pump (1998) ASHRAE Trans, 104, pp. 387-394; Liebenberg, L., Meyer, J.P., Potential of the zeotropic mixture R-22/R-142b in high-temperature heat pump water heaters with capacity modulation (1998) ASHRAE Trans, 104, pp. 418-429; Zhang, S.J., Wang, H.X., Guo, T., Experimental investigation of moderately high temperature water source heat pump with non-azeotropic refrigerant mixtures (2009) Appl Energy, , doi: 10.1016/j.apener-gy.2009.11.001; Zheng, C.M., Wang, H.X., Ma, L.M., Pseudo-critical compressibility factor ζ c and slope f in pt equation of state for 33 refrigerants (in Chinese) (2005) J Eng Thermophys, 26 (3), pp. 373-375; Patel, N.C., Teja, A.S., A new cubic equation of state for fluids and fluid mixtures (1982) Chem Eng Sci, 37 (3), pp. 463-473. , 10.1016/0009-2509(82)80099-7; Bruce, E.P., John, M.P., John, P.O., (2001) The Properties of Gases and Liquids, , 5th ed.
