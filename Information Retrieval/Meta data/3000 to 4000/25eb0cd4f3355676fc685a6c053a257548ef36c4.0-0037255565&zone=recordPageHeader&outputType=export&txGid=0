The purpose of the present study was to perform an environmental assessment for the entire life cycle of a seafood product and to include fishery-specific types of environmental impact in inventory and assessment. Environmental data for a frozen block of cod fillets was collected and used for a Life Cycle Assessment, including the fishery-specific environmental aspects seafloor use and biological extraction of target, by-catch and discard species. The fishery takes place in the Baltic Sea where cod is mainly fished by benthic trawls and gillnets. Methods. The functional unit was a consumer package of frozen cod fillets (400 g) reaching the household. Data was gathered from fishermen, fishery statistics, databases, companies and literature. Fishery-specific issues like the impact on stocks of the target and by-catch species, seafloor impact and discarding were quantified in relation to the functional unit and qualitative impact assessment of these aspects was included. Results. Findings include the fact that all environmental impact categories assessed (Global Warming Potential, Eutrophication Potential, Acidification Potential, Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential and Aquatic Ecotoxiciy) are dominated by the fishery. Around 700 m2 of seafloor are swept by trawls and around 50 g of under-sized cod and other marine species are discarded per functional unit. The phases contributing most to total environmental impact following fishery were transports and preparation in the household. The process industry and municipal sewage treatment cause considerable amounts of eutrophying emissions. Conclusions. Conclusions are that there are considerable options for improvement of the environmental performance of the seafood production chain. In the fishery, the most important environmental measure is to fish sustainably managed stocks. Speed optimisation, increased use of less energy-intensive fishing gear and improved engine and fuel technology are technical measures that would considerably decrease resource use and environmental impact caused by fishery. Due to the importance of fishery for the overall results, the most important environmental improvement option after landing is to maintain high quality and minimise product losses. Recommendations and Outlook. The need for good baseline data concerning resource use and marine environmental impact of fisheries in order to perform environmental assessment of seafood products was demonstrated. LCA was shown to be a valuable tool for such assessments, which in the future could be used to improve the environmental performance of the seafood production chain or in the development of criteria of eco-labelling of seafood products originating in capture fisheries.","Baltic Sea; By-catch; Cod; Discard; Fishery; Gadus morhua; Gillnet; GIS; LCA; Seafloor effects; Seafood; Trawl","article; environmental impact assessment; fishery; life cycle; marine environment; priority journal; sea food; sewage treatment; Gadus; Gadus morhua",,,,,,"Aanondsen, S.A., (2001), (SINTEF fisheries and aquaculture) Personal communication about ongoing study on fuel consumption in the Nordic fisheries and results from the TEES (the energy efficient ship) project (svein.aanondsen@fish.sintef.no)Akse, L., (2001), (Fiskeriforskning Norway) Personal communication about quality of fish caught with different fishing methods (leif.akse@ fiskforsk.norut.no)Alverson, D.L., Freeberg, M.H., Murawski, S.A., Pope, J.G., (1994) A Global Assessment of Fisheries Bycatch and Discards, , FAO, Rome; Andersson, K., LCA of Food Products and Production Systems (2000) International Journal of LCA, 5 (4), pp. 239-248; (1986) Livsmedelstabeller - Energi Och Näringsämnen (Food Tables - Energy and Nutrients, in Swedish), , Livsmedelsverket (National Food Administration), Stockholm; (1997) Hav Och Kust.
