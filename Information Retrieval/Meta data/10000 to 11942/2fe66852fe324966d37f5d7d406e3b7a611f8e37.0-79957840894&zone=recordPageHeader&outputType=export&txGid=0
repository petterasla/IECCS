Here we reveal that borate catalyzes the conversion of CO 2 to HCO3 - via the same fundamental mechanism as the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is responsible for CO2 hydration in the human body. In this mechanism the tetrahydroxyborate ion, B(OH)4 -, is the active form of boron that undergoes direct reaction with CO2. In addition to being able to accelerate CO 2 hydration in alkaline solvents used for carbon capture, we hypothesize that this mechanism controls CO2 uptake by certain saline bodies of water, such as Mono Lake (California), where previously inexplicable influx rates of inorganic carbon have created unique chemistry. The new understanding of CO2 hydration provided here should lead to improved models for the carbon cycle in highly saline bodies of water and to advances in carbon capture and geoengineering technology. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Anthropogenic global warming; California; Carbon capture; Carbon cycles; Direct reactions; Environmental process; Geoengineering; Human bodies; Improved models; Inorganic carbon; Mechanism control; Mono Lake; Alkalinity; Banks (bodies of water); Boron; Boron compounds; Carbonic anhydrase; Catalysis; Global warming; Hydration; Saline water; Carbon dioxide; boric acid; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; solvent; acidification; bicarbonate; borate; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; catalysis; enzyme activity; global warming; hydration; inorganic carbon; transformation; acidification; alkalinity; aqueous solution; article; bioengineering; biotransformation; carbon cycle; catalysis; catalyst; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; concentration (parameters); greenhouse effect; hydration; United States; Borates; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Global Warming; Water; California; Mono Lake; United States",,"boric acid, 10043-35-3, 11113-50-1, 11129-12-7, 14213-97-9; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbonate dehydratase, 9001-03-0; Borates; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Carbonic Anhydrases, 4.2.1.1; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Lackner, K.S., Carbonate chemistry for sequestering fossil carbon (2002) Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 27, pp. 193-232. , DOI 10.1146/annurev.energy.27.122001.083433; Lackner, K.S., A guide to CO2 sequestration (2003) Science, 300 (5626), pp. 1677-1678. , DOI 10.1126/science.1079033; Keith, D.W., Why Capture CO2 from the Atmosphere?
