The methodology is useful in the designing time to optimize, luminaires, system and control and in management time to certificate the systems. Four energy performance indicators are suggested: EPL for the luminaires like a label, EPS for the lighting systems arrangement, EPC for the control system and EPG for the global system. By the indicators suggested it is possible to define a certification in energy classes of lighting systems according to the standard EN 15217. © 2012 IEEE.","building automation; efficiency evaluation; energy certification; green building; interior lighting system","Building automation; Efficiency evaluation; Energy certification; Green buildings; Interior lighting; Benchmarking; Industrial applications; Intelligent buildings; Lighting; Lighting fixtures; Energy efficiency",,,,,,"Parise, G., Martirano, L., Ecodesign of lighting systems (2011) Industry Applications Magazine, pp. 14-19. , March-April; Parise, G., Martirano, L., Impact of building automation, controls and building management on energy performance of lighting systems IEEE I&CPS 2009, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 3-7 May 2009; Martirano, L., Lighting systems to save energy in educational classrooms 2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering (EEEIC), Rome 8-11 May 2011; Martirano, L., A Smart Lighting Control to Save Energy The 6th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications, 15-17 September 2011, Prague, Czech Republic; Light and Lighting - Lighting of Work Places - Part 1: Indoor Work Places, , EN 12464-1 Standard 2002; (2005) Energy Performance of Buildings - Energy Requirements for Lighting - Part 1: Lighting Energy Estimation, , EN15193-1 March; (2007) Energy Performance of Buildings - Impact of Building Automation, Controls and Building Management, , EN 15232 October; Parise, G., Martirano, L., Combined Electric Light and Daylight Systems Ecodesign 2011 IEEE-IAS, Annual Meeting Orlando FL, USA 9-13 October 2011; Parise, G., Martirano, L., Daylight Impact on Energy Performance of Internal Lighting 2011 IEEE-IAS, Annual Meeting Orlando FL, USA 9-13 October 2011; Martirano, L., Di Ponio, S., Procedure to evaluate indoor lighting energy performance 2012 11th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering (EEEIC), Venice, Italy, 18-25 May 2012; (2007) Energy Performance of Buildings - Methods for Expressing Energy Performance and for the Energy Certification of Buildings, , EN 15217 September","Parise, G.; Electrical Engineering Dept., University of Rome La Sapienza, Via Eudossiana, 18, 00184 - Rome, Italy",,,,"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, IAS 2012","7 October 2012 through 11 October 2012","Las Vegas, NV",94677,01972618,9781467303309,CIASD,,"English","Conf Rec IAS Annu Meet",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871660524
