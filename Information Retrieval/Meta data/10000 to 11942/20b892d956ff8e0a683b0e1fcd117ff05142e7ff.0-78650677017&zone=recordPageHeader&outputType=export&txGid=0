We investigated the effect of decreasing soil water potentials on gross ammonification and nitrification in different soil horizons of a Norway spruce forest and tested the hypotheses that i) gross rates are more sensitive to desiccation in the Oa and EA horizon as compared to the uppermost Oi/Oe horizon and ii) that gross nitrification is more sensitive than gross ammonification. Soil samples were adjusted by air drying to water potentials from about field capacity to around -1.0 MPa, a range that is often observed under field conditions at our site. Gross rates were measured using the 15N pool dilution technique. To ensure that the addition of solute label to dry soils and the local rewetting does not affect the results by re-mineralization or preferential consumption of 15N, we compared different extraction and incubation times. T0 times ranging from 10 to 300 min and incubation times of 48 h and 72 h did not influence the rates of gross ammonification and nitrification. Even small changes of water potential decreased gross ammonification and nitrification in the O horizon. In the EA horizon, gross nitrification was below detection limit and the response of the generally low rates of gross ammonification to decreasing water potentials was minor. In the Oi/Oe horizon gross ammonification and nitrification decreased from 37.5 to 18.3 mg N kg-1 soil d-1 and from 15.4 to 5.6 mg N kg-1 soil d-1 when the water potential decreased from field capacity to -0.8 MPa. In the Oa horizon gross ammonification decreased from 7.4 to 4.0 mg N kg-1 soil d-1 when the water potential reached -0.6 MPa. At such water potential nitrification almost ceased, while in the Oi/Oe horizon nitrification continued at a rather high level. Hence, only in the Oa horizon nitrification was more sensitive to desiccation than ammonification. Extended drought periods that might result from climate change will cause a reduction in gross N turnover rates in forest soils even at moderate levels of soil desiccation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","15N pool dilution technique; Forest soil; Norway spruce","Air drying; Coniferous forest soils; Detection limits; Dilution technique; Drought periods; Dry soil; Field capacity; Field conditions; Forest soils; Global climate changes; Gross nitrification; Gross rates; Incubation time; Low rates; Norway spruce; Re-wetting; Soil horizon; Soil sample; Soil water potential; Soil water regime; Temperate forests; Turnover rate; Water potential; Climate change; Denitrification; Driers (materials); Lakes; Nitrification; Oxidation; Soil moisture; Underwater soils; Forestry; acid soil; ammonification; climate change; coniferous forest; forest soil; global perspective; hypothesis testing; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; soil nitrogen; soil water; temperate forest; Driers; Forestry; Lakes; Moisture; Nitrification; Oxidation; Picea Abies; Soil; Picea abies",,,,,,"Barraclough, D., Puri, G., The use of 15N pool dilution and enrichment to separate the heterotrophic and autotrophic pathways of nitrification (1995) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 27, pp. 17-22; Berg, M.P., Kniese, J.P., Verhoef, H.A., Dynamics and stratification of bacteria and fungi in the organic layers of a Scots pine forest soil (1998) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 26, pp. 313-322; Borken, W., Matzner, E., Reappraisal of drying and wetting effects on C and N mineralization and fluxes in soils (2009) Global Change Biology, 15, pp. 808-824; Brüggemann, N., Rosenkranz, P., Papen, H., Pilegaard, K., Butterbach-Bahl, K., Pure stands of temperate forest tree species modify soil respiration and N turnover (2005) Biogeosciences Discussions, 2, pp. 303-331; Burton, J., Chen, C., Xu, Z., Ghadiri, H., Gross nitrogen transformations in adjacent native and plantation forests of subtropical Australia (2007) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 39, pp. 426-433; Campbell, J.L., Gower, S.T., Detritus production and soil N transformations in old-growth eastern hemlock and sugar maple stands (2000) Ecosystems, 3, pp. 185-192; Christenson, L.M., Lovett, G.M., Weathers, K.C., Arthur, M.A., The influence of tree species, nitrogen fertilization, and soil C to N ratio on gross soil nitrogen transformations (2009) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 73, pp. 638-646; Corre, M.D., Brumme, R., Veldkamp, E., Beese, F.O., Changes in nitrogen cycling and retention processes in soils under spruce forests along a nitrogen enrichment gradient in Germany (2007) Global Change Biology, 13, pp. 1509-1527; Csonka, L.N., Physiological and genetic responses of bacteria to osmotic stress (1989) Microbiological Reviews, 53, pp. 121-147; Davidson, E.A., Belk, E., Boone, R.D., Soil water content and temperature as independent or confounded factors controlling soil respiration in a temperate mixed hardwood forest (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 217-227; De Boer, W., Tietema, A., Gunnewiek, P.J.A.K., Laanbroek, H.J., The chemolithotrophic ammonium-oxidizing community in a nitrogen-saturated acid forest soil in relation to pH-dependent nitrifying activity (1992) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 24, pp. 229-234; Fierer, N., Schimel, J.P., Holden, P.A., Variations in microbial community composition through two soil depth profiles (2003) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 35, pp. 167-176; Ford, D.J., Cookson, W.R., Adams, M.A., Grierson, P.F., Role of soil drying in nitrogen mineralization and microbial community function in semi-arid grasslands of north-west Australia (2007) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 39, pp. 1557-1569; Fritze, H., Pietikäinen, J., Pennanen, T., Distribution of microbial biomass and phospholipid fatty acids in podzol profiles under coniferous forest (2000) European Journal of Soil Science, 51, pp. 565-573; Gleeson, D.B., Herrmann, A.M., Livesley, S.J., Murphy, D.V., Influence of water potential on nitrification and structure of nitrifying bacterial communities in semiarid soils (2008) Applied Soil Ecology, 40, pp. 189-194; Grenon, F., Bradley, R.L., Titus, B.D., Temperature sensitivity of mineral N transformation rates, and heterotrophic nitrification: possible factors controlling the post-disturbance mineral N flush in forest floors (2004) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 36, pp. 1465-1474; Harris, R.F., Effect of water potential on microbial growth and activity (1985) Water Potential Relations in Soil Microbiology, pp. 23-95. , American Society of Agronomy, Madison, J.F.
