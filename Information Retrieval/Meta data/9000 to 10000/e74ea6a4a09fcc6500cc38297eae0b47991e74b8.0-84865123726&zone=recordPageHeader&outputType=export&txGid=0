We conducted a comparative study to determine NH 4 + and NO 3 - concentrations in soil profiles (0-200cm) and examined the net nitrogen (N) mineralization and net nitrification in soil surface (0-20cm) of adjacent naturally regenerated secondary forests (NSF), man-made forests (MMF), grasslands and cropland soils from the windy arid and semi-arid Hebei plateau, the sandstorm and water source area of Beijing, China. Cropland and grassland soils showed significantly higher inorganic N concentrations than forest soils. NO 3 --N accounted for 50-90% of inorganic N in cropland and grassland soils, while NH 4 +-N was the main form of inorganic N in NSF and MMF soils. Average net N-mineralization rates (mgkg -1d -1) were much higher in native ecosystems (1.51 for NSF soils and 1.24 for grassland soils) than in human disturbed LUT (0.15 for cropland soils and 0.85 for MMF soils). Net ammonification was low in all the LUT while net nitrification was the major process of net N mineralization. For more insight in urea transformation, the increase in NH 4 + and, NO 3 - concentrations as well as C mineralization after urea addition was analyzed on whole soils. Urea application stimulated the net soil C mineralization and urea transformation pattern was consistent with net soil N mineralization, except that the rate was slightly slower. Land-use conversion from NSF to MMF, or from grassland to cropland decreased soil net N mineralization, but increased net nitrification after 40years or 70years, respectively. The observed higher rates of net nitrification suggested that land-use conversions in the Hebei plateau might lead to N losses in the form of nitrate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Land-use type; Microbial biomass; Nitrification; Nitrogen mineralization","ammonium; biomass; carbon dioxide; comparative study; dust storm; forest soil; grassland soil; land use change; microbial community; mineralization; nitrate; nitrification; nutrient cycling; secondary forest; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; soil profile; soil respiration; soil surface; sustainability; urea; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Hebei Plain",,,,,,"Aarnio, T., McCullough, K., Trofymow, J.A., Fate of urea and ureaformaldehyde nitrogen in a one-year laboratory incubation with Douglas-fir forest floor (1996) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 28 (10-11), pp. 1407-1415; Alef, K., Beck, T., Zelles, L., Kleiner, D., A comparison of methods to estimate microbial biomass and N-mineralization in agricultural and grassland soils (1988) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 20 (4), pp. 561-565; Bielek, P., (1998) Nitrate in nature: product of soil cover, pp. 527-530. , Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands; Bremner, J.M., Total nitrogen, inorganic forms of nitrogen, organic forms of nitrogen, nitrogen availability indexes (1965), pp. 1324-1348. , In: Black, C.A., (Eds.).
