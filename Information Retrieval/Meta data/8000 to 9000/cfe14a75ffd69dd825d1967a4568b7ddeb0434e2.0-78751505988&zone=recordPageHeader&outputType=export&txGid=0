In the current global ecological crisis and the limited degree of supportability of the environment, the authors of this paper highlight the importance of promoting biomass energy to achieve environmental protection as a component of sustainable development of human society in a clean environment free from environmental risks.","Biomass; Energy crisis; Pollution; Sustainable development",,,,,,,"Bedi, E., Olesen, G.B., Myles, R., (2008) Distant Internet Education on Renewable Energy Technologies, , http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/Biomass, On line at; Cioablǎ, A.E., Ionel, I., Pǎdurean, I., Ţenchea, A., Popescu, F., Savu, A., Biogas production from agricultural residues (2009) Metalurgia International, 3, pp. 40-44; Dima, M., (2005) Urban Waste Water Treatment, , Tehnopress, Iasi, Romania; Directive 2003/30/EC of the european parliament and of the council on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport (2003) Official Journal of the European Union, 50. , EC Directive 123/42, 17.5.2003, Brussels; Directive 2009/28/EC of the european parliament and of the council regarding the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (2009) Official Journal of the European Union, 50. , EC Directive 140/48, 5.06.2009, Brussels; (2010), http://www.environmentalcrime.com/Climate_Change.html, On line atEnergy transition in europe - An overview of status and policy strategies for transforming european energy systems (2006) European Parliamentary Technology Assessment Report, , http://www.eptanetwork.org/EPTA/EPTA-energy-overview.php, EPTA Oslo, October 2006 On line at; Sustainable bioenergy development in UEMOA member countries, biomass conversion technologies, energy sector management assistance programme (2008) The World Bank, World Development Report 2008, , www.compete-bioafrica.net//UNF_Bioenergy_full_report-10-2008.pdf, ESMAP Washington DC, On line at; Kaushik, N., Soumitra, B., Basak, P.R., Biofuels - Technology trends & opportunities (2007) SEARCH, 10, pp. 92-97; Lunguleasa, A., Density of ecological wooden briquettes obtained from woody biomass (2009) Environmental Engineering and Management Journal, 8, pp. 691-694; Gavrilescu, M., Biomass power for energy and sustainable development (2008) Environmental Engineering and Management Journal, 7, pp. 617-640; Governmental decision no. 1535/2004 approving the strategy for capitalization of renewable energy sources (2004) Romanian Official Monitor No. 8/07.01.2004, , http://www.enero.ro/doc/MOF8-HG1535.pdf, GD On line at; Governmental decision no. 1844/2005 on the promotion of the use of bio-fuels or other renewable fuels for transport (2005) Romanian Official Monitor No. 44/18.01.2006, , http://www.minind.ro/domenii_sectoare/leg_armonizata/energie/ Energie_19_04_06.htmL, GD On line at; Hall, D.O., House, J.I., (1995) Biomass Energy Development and Carbon Dioxide Mitigation Options, , http://uneprisoe.org/copenhagenconf/hall.htm, On line at; Ion, V.I., Ion, D., Energy from biomass - Technical considerations (2006) Energie, 7, pp. 14-30; Keay, M., (2007) Energy: The Long View, , Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, London; Nzihou, A., Toward the valorization of waste and biomass (2010) Waste and Biomass Valorization, 1, pp. 3-7; Russ, P., Wiesenthal, T., Van Regemorter, D., Ciscar, J.C., Global climate policy scenarios for 2030 and beyond - Analysis of greenhouse gas emission reduction pathway scenarios with the POLES and GEM-E3 models (2007) Reference Report / EUR 23032/ (EN) by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, , http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/ jrc_reference_report_2007_11_climatepolicy.pdf, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, On line at; Tucu, D., Mnerie, D., Rotarescu, V., Solution for obtaining biofuels from houses and urban wastes (2007) Scientific Bulletin of the Polytechnic University of Timisoara, 52, pp. 109-113; Wright, L., Boundy, B., Badger, P.C., Perlack, B., Davis, S., (2009) Biomass Energy Data Book, , http://cta.ornl.gov/bedb/index.shtml, 2nd Edition, Report No. ORNL/TM-2009/098, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, Office of the Biomass Program Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy, On line at","Cornea, T.
