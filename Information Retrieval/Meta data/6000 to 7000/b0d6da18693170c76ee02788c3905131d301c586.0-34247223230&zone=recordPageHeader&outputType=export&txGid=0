The California water system is especially vulnerable to global warming due to its dependence on mountain snow accumulation and the snowmelt process. Since 1983, more than 60 studies have investigated climate change impacts on hydrology and water resources in California. These studies can be categorized in three major fields: (1) Studies of historical trends of streamflow and snowpack in order to determine if there is any evidence of climate change in the geophysical record; (2) Studies of potential future predicted effects of climate change on streamflow and; (3) Studies that use those predicted changes in natural runoff to determine their economic, ecologic, or institutional impacts. In this paper we review these studies with an emphasis on methodological procedures. We provide for each category of studies a summary of significant conclusions and potential areas for future work. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Economic analysis; Ecosystems; Global warming; Hydrology; Snow; Water resources; California; Mountain snow; Snowpack; Streamflow; Geophysics; global climate; global warming; hydrology; snowpack; streamflow; water resource; California; North America; United States",,,,,,"Aguado, E., Cayan, D.R., Riddle, L.G., Roos, M., Climatic fluctuations and the timing of West Coast streamflow (1992) J Climate, 5, pp. 1468-1483; Arnell, N.W., Climate change and global water resources (1999) Glob Environ Change, 9 (SUPPL.), pp. S31-S49; Brekke, L.D., Miller, N.L., Bashford, K.E., Quinn, N.W.T., Dracup, J.A., Climate change impacts uncertainty for water resources in the San Joaquin River Basin, California (2004) J Am Water Resour Assoc, 40 (1), pp. 149-164; Carpenter TM, Georgakakos KP (2001) Assessment of Folsom lake response to historical and potential future climate scenarios: 1.
