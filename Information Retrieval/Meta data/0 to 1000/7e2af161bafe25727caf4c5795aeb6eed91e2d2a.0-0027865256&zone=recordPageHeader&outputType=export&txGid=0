I test this hypothesis using results from published experimental studies. Wind speed generally increases with altitude on mountains, and plants from high altitude tend to be more wind resistant than species from the lowland. Therefore it is expected that, particularly on wind-swept mountains, global warming will not necessarily be followed by the spread of lowland species into the uplands. -from Author",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; environmental change; global warming; lowland/upland transition; mountain; mountain ecology; plant response; wind",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10510761,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027865256
