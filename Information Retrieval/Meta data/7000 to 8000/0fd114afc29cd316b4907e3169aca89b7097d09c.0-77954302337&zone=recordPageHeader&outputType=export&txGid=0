The studied pathways include reformulated gasoline and low sulphur diesel produced from oil sands, oil shale, coal and natural gas, as well as reference pathways from conventional crude oil. A comparison of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) completed for these fuels indicates considerable uncertainty in these emissions, illustrating the need for further LCAs with particular attention to completeness and transparency. Based on the considered studies, only one unconventional pathway has better GHG emissions performance than the conventional pathways: Fischer-Tropsch diesel from natural gas. However, the limitations of the data used here and other factors that may restrict a switch to natural gas must be considered. Furthermore, there are considerable opportunities to reduce emissions from the unconventional pathways. There is significant potential to produce liquid transportation fuels from unconventional Canadian and US fossil sources. However, to avoid significant increases in GHG emissions, the life cycle GHG implications of almost all pathways will need to be reduced to respond to upcoming regulatory initiatives and to move towards a more sustainable transportation sector. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","coal-to-liquids; CTL; gas-to-liquids; GHG; global warming; greenhouse gas; GTL; LCA; life cycle assessment; oil sands; oil shale; transportation fuels",,,,,,,"(2005) Documentation for Natural Resources Canada’s GHGenius Model 3.0, , Prepared for Natural Resources Canada, 15 September; (2006) The Addition of Palm Oil Biodiesel and Coal Derived FT Distillate to GHGenius, , Prepared for Natural Resources Canada, 15 May; (2007) 2007 Crude Oil Production Update for GHGenius, , Prepared for Natural Resources Canada, 30 March; Alberta Chamber of Resources (ACR), (2004) Oil Sands Technology Roadmap – Unlocking the Potential, , 30 January; Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (AEUB), (2005) Alberta’s reserves 2004 and supply/demand outlook/overview 2005, , Statistical Series 2005–98; Bartis, J.T., Testimony: policy issues for oil shale development (2007) Presented Before the House Natural Resources Committee, Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, , http://rand.org/pubs/testimonies/2007/RAND_CT279.pdf, RAND Corporation: Santa Monica, California, 17 April accessed 28 April 2008; Bartis, J.T., LaTourrette, T., Dixon, L., Peterson, D.J., Cecchine, G., (2005) Oil Shale Development in the United States: Prospects and Policy Issues, , RAND Corporation: Santa Monica, California; Bergerson, J., Keith, D., (2006) Life cycle assessment of oil sands technologies, , http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ABEnergyFutures-11.pdf, Alberta Energy Futures Workshop Paper; Brandt, A.R., (2007) Converting Green River oil shale to liquid fuels with the Alberta Taciuk Processor: energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions, , http://abrandt.berkeley.edu/shale/Brandt%20_ATP_Energy_and_Emissions_dist.pdf, Working paper, 1 June; Brandt, A.R., Farrell, A.E., Scraping the bottom of the barrel: greenhouse gas emission consequences of a transition to low-quality and synthetic petroleum resources (2007) Climatic Change, 84, pp. 241-263; Canadian Centre for Energy Information (Centre for Energy), (2007) Energy facts & statistics, Canada, , http://www.centreforenergy.com/FactsStats/statistics.asp?template=5,0, (accessed 6 May 2008); ecoENERGY Carbon Capture and Storage Task Force, The (ecoENERGY), (2008) Canada’s fossil energy future, the way forward on carbon capture and storage, , 9 January, Report to: The Minister of Alberta Energy, The Minister of Natural Resources Canada; Farrell, A.E., Brandt, A.R., Risks of the oil transition (2006) Environmental Research Letters, 1, pp. 1-6; Farrell, A.E., Sperling, D., Arons, S.M., Brandt, A.R., Delucchi, M.A., Eggert, A., Haya, B.K., (2007) A low-carbon fuel standard for California Part 1: technical analysis, , http://repositories.cdlib.org/its/tsrc/UCB-ITS-TSRC-RR-2007, UC Berkeley Transportation Sustainability Research Center, UCB-ITS-TSRC-RR-2007-2, 29 May; Flint, L., (2004) Bitumen & Very Heavy Crude Upgrading Technology — A Review of Long Term R&D Opportunities, , LENEF Consulting Limited, Calgary, Alberta, 31 March; GHGenius Model Ver. 3.11, Natural Resources Canada, , http://www.ghgenius.ca, Ottawa, ON; Gray, D., White, C., Tomlinson, G., Ackiewicz, M., Schmetz, E., Winslow, J., (2007) Increasing Security and Reducing Carbon Emissions of the U.S. Transportation Sector: A Transformational Role for Coal with Biomass, , DOE/NETL-2007/1298, 24 August, Prepared for the Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory and the Department of Defense, Air Force; Greene, D.L., (1999) An Assessment of Energy and Environmental Issues Related to the Use of Gas-to-Liquid Fuels in Transportation, , ORNL/TM-1999/258, Prepared by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, managed by Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp. for the US Department of Energy; Greenhouse Gas, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET), Model Version 1.8b, Argonne National Laboratory, , http://www.transportation.anl.gov/software/GREET, Argonne, IL; Jamieson, A., McManus, G., GTL production will partially ease regional diesel, naphtha imbalances (2007) Oil & Gas Journal, 105, pp. 49-53; Lee, S., Clean liquid fuels from coal (2007) Handbook of Alternative Fuel Technologies, , S.
