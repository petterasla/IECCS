The contributions to changes in precipitation minus evaporation, P-E, caused thermodynamically by changes in specific humidity, dynamically by changes in circulation, and by changes in moisture transports by transient eddies are evaluated. The thermodynamic and dynamic contributions are further separated into advective and divergent components. The nonthermodynamic contributions are then related to changes in the mean and transient circulation. The projected change in P-E involves an intensification of the existing pattern of P-E with wet areas [the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and mid-to high latitudes] getting wetter and arid and semiarid regions of the subtropics getting drier. In addition, the subtropical dry zones expand poleward. The accentuation of the twentieth-century pattern of P-E is in part explained by increases in specific humidity via both advection and divergence terms. Weakening of the tropical divergent circulation partially opposes the thermodynamic contribution by creating a tendency to decreased P-E in the ITCZ and to increased P-E in the descending branches of the Walker and Hadley cells. The changing mean circulation also causes decreased P-E on the poleward flanks of the subtropics because the descending branch of the Hadley Cell expands and the midlatitude meridional circulation cell shifts poleward. Subtropical drying and poleward moistening are also contributed to by an increase in poleward moisture transport by transient eddies. The thermodynamic contribution to changing P-E, arising from increased specific humidity, is almost entirely accounted for by atmospheric warming under fixed relative humidity. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.",,"Arid and semi-arid regions; Atmospheric warming; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Dynamic mechanism; Hadley cells; High Latitudes; Hydrological cycles; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Intertropical convergence zone; Meridional circulation; Midlatitudes; Moisture transport; Poleward moisture transport; Relative humidities; Specific humidity; Arid regions; Climate models; Dynamics; Global warming; Moisture; Thermodynamics; Tropics; Atmospheric humidity; advection; atmospheric circulation; eddy; global warming; Hadley cell; hydrological cycle; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; intertropical convergence zone; meridional circulation; moisture transfer; numerical model; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; thermodynamics; Walker circulation",,,,,,"Bengtsson, L., Hodges, K.I., Roeckner, E., Storm tracks and climate change (2006) J.
