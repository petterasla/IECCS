To meet these objectives, the WCRP has instituted a set of research programs focusing on specific aspects of the physical climate system. A major thrust of the WCRP is to reduce the uncertainties in simulations of climatic response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. There is need for a continuous interaction between the modelling community and those scientists studying the processes and data. Through international coordination and national contributions considerable progress has been made over the past decade and we anticipate similar success in the future. -from Author",,"climate predictability; global change model; greenhouse gas; physical perspective",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028181188
