For the Great Barrier Reef, are there historically stable southern refugia where corals from the north might migrate as climate changes? To address this question, we present a precise chronology of marginal coral reef development from Moreton Bay, southeast Queensland, Australia. Our chronology shows that reef growth was episodic, responding to natural environmental variation throughout the Holocene, and that Moreton Bay was inhospitable to corals for about half of the past 7000 years. The only significant change in coral species composition occurred between ~200 and ~50 years ago, following anthropogenic alterations of the bay and its catchments. Natural historical instability of reefs, coupled with environmental degradation since European colonization, suggests that Moreton Bay offers limited potential as refuge habitat for reef species on human time scales. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"anthropogenic effect; chronology; climate change; community composition; community dynamics; coral reef; environmental change; environmental degradation; episodic event; growth rate; habitat quality; Holocene; hydrological change; paleoecology; refuge; tropical environment; Australia; Moreton Bay; Queensland; Anthozoa; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Aronson, R.B., Macintyre, I.G., Precht, W.F., Murdoch, T.J.T., Wapnick, C.M., The expanding scale of species turnover events on coral reefs in Belize (2002) Ecological Monographs, 72 (2), pp. 233-249; Donders, T.H., Wagner-Cremer, F., Visscher, H., Integration of proxy data and model scenarios for the mid-Holocene onset of modern ENSO variability (2008) Quaternary Science Reviews, 27 (5-6), pp. 571-579. , DOI 10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.11.010, PII S0277379107003186; Edinger, E.N., Jompa, J., Limmon, G.V., Widjatmoko, W., Risk, M.J., Reef degradation and coral biodiversity in Indonesia: Effects of land-based pollution, destructive fishing practices and changes over time (1998) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 36 (8), pp. 617-630. , DOI 10.1016/S0025-326X(98)00047-2, PII S0025326X98000472; Edinger, E.N., Pandolfi, J.M., Kelley, R.A., Community structure of Quaternary coral reefs compared with Recent life and death assemblages (2001) Paleobiology, 27 (4), pp. 669-694; Flood, P.G., The significance of two contrasting sedimentary environments (the fringing coral reef and the tidal mud flat) presently in juxtaposition along the southwestern shore of Moreton Bay, Queensland (1978) Pap Dep Geol Univ Queensland, 8, pp. 44-65; Galloway, R.W., (1984) Coastal Lands of Australia, , Institute of Biological Resources.
