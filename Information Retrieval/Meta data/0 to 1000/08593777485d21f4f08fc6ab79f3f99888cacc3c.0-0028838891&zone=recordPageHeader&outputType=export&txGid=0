However, the reliability of these results has been questioned because of problems with data quality and physical processes that introduce a high level of spatial and temporal variability. Future sea level is expected to rise by ~1 m, with a ""best-guess' value of 48 cm by the year 2100. Such rates represent an acceleration of four to seven times over present rates. Local land subsidence could substantially increase the apparent SLR. Because of the high spatial variability in crustal subsidence rates, wave climates and tidal regimes, it will be the set of local conditions (especially the relative sea-level rise), rather than a single global mean sea-level trend, that will determine each locality's vulnerability to future SLR. -from Author",,"climate change; crustal subsidence; future trend; ice sheet; sea level rise; tide gauge record",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028838891
