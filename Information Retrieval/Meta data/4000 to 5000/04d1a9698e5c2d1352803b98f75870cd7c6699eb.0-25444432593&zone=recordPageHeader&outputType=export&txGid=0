Antarctic fishes are often cited as a classic example to illustrate the specialization process and are regarded as the archetypal stenotherms. Here we show that the Antarctic fish Pagothenia borchgrevinki has retained the capacity to compensate for chronic temperature change. By displaying astounding plasticity in cardiovascular response and metabolic control, the fishes maintained locomotory performance at elevated temperatures. Our falsification of the specialization paradigm indicates that the effect of climate change on species distribution and extinction may be overestimated by current models of global warming. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Cardiac scope; Climate change; Critical swimming speed; Metabolism; Plasticity","climate change; metabolism; plasticity; swimming behavior; Antarctica; article; climate change; controlled study; environmental factor; evolutionary adaptation; fish; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; plasticity; priority journal; sea surface temperature; temperature measurement; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Perciformes; Swimming; Temperature; oceanic regions; Southern Ocean; World; Pagothenia borchgrevinki; Pisces",,,,,,"Axelsson, M., Davison, W., Forster, M.E., Farrell, A.P., Cardiovascular responses of the red-blooded Antarctic fishes Pagothenia bernacchii and P. borchgrevinki (1992) J.
