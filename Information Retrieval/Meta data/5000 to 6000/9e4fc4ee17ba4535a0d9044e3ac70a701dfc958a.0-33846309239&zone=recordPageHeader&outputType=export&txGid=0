We first consider the extent to which simulations of twentieth century climate from nine atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) are able to reproduce observed changes in these indicators. We then evaluate projected future trends in primary climate characteristics and indicators of change, including seasonal temperatures, rainfall and drought, snow cover, soil moisture, streamflow, and changes in biometeorological indicators that depend on threshold or accumulated temperatures such as growing season, frost days, and Spring Indices (SI). Changes in indicators for which temperature-related signals have already been observed (seasonal warming patterns, advances in high-spring streamflow, decreases in snow depth, extended growing seasons, earlier bloom dates) are generally reproduced by past model simulations and are projected to continue in the future. Other indicators for which trends have not yet been observed also show projected future changes consistent with a warmer climate (shrinking snow cover, more frequent droughts, and extended low-flow periods in summer). The magnitude of temperature-driven trends in the future are generally projected to be higher under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) mid-high (A2) and higher (A1FI) emissions scenarios than under the lower (B1) scenario. These results provide confidence regarding the direction of many regional climate trends, and highlight the fundamental role of future emissions in determining the potential magnitude of changes we can expect over the coming century. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"air temperature; assessment method; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; global change; hydrological change; oceanic general circulation model; regional climate; trend analysis; twentieth century; North America; United States",,,,,,"Abdulla, F.A., Lettenmaier, D.P., Wood, E.F., Smith, J.A., Application of a macroscale hydrologic model to estimate the water balance of the Arkansas-Red river basin (1996) J Geophys Res, 101 (D3), pp. 7449-7459; Amiro, B.D., Stocks, B.J., Alexander, M.E., Flannigan, M.D., Wotton, B.M., Fire, climate change, carbon and fuel management in the Canadian boreal forest (2001) Int J Wildland Fire, 10, pp. 405-413; Beltaos, S., Prowse, T.D., Effects of climate on mid-winter ice jams (2002) Hydrol Proc, 16, pp. 789-804; Bradbury, J.A., Dingman, S.L., Keim, B.D., New England drought and relations with large scale atmospheric circulation patterns (2002) JAWRA, 38, pp. 1287-1299; Brooks, P.D., Inorganic nitrogen and microbial biomass dynamics before and during spring snowmelt (1998) Biogeochemistry, 43, pp. 1-15; Brown, T.J., Hall, B.L., Westerling, A.L., The impact of twenty-first century climate change on wildland fire danger in the western United States: An applications perspective (2004) Clim Change, 62, pp. 365-388; Cherkauer, K.A., Bowling, L.C., Lettenmaier, D.P., Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) cold land process model updates (2002) Glob Planet Change, 38, pp. 151-159; Collins, W.D., Bitz, C.M., Blackmon, M.L., Bonan, G.B., Bretherton, C.S., Carton, J.A., Chang, P., Smith, R.D., The Community Climate System Model: CCSM3 (2006) J Clim, 19, pp. 2122-2143; Dai, A., Hu, A., Meehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Strand, W.G., Atlantic thermohaline circulation in a coupled general circulation model: Unforced variations versus forced changes (2004) J Clim, 18, pp. 3270-3293; Daly, C., Taylor, G., Gibson, W., The PRISM approach to mapping precipitation and temperature (1997) Tenth Conference on Applied Climatology, pp. 10-12. , In: American Meteorological Society, Reno, NV; DeGaetano, A.T., Allen, R.J., Trends in twentieth-century temperature extremes across the United States (2002) J Clim, 15, pp. 3188-3205; Delworth, T.L., Broccoli, A.J., Rosati, A., Stouffer, R.J., GFDL's CM2 global coupled climate models - Part 1 - Formulation and simulation characteristics (2006) J Clim, 19, pp. 643-674; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Pal, J.S., Trapp, R.J., Giorgi, F., Fine-scale processes regulate the response of extreme events to global climate change (2005) PNAS, 102, pp. 15774-15778; Dirmeyer, P.A., Brubaker, K.L., Evidence for trends in the northern hemisphere water cycle (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L14712. , DOI 10.1029/2006GL026359; Dorsch, P., Overwintering greenhouse gas fluxes in two contrasting agricultural habitats (2004) Nutr Cycling Agroecosyst, 70, pp. 117-133; Easterling, D.R., Karl, T.R., Lawrimore, J.H., Del Greco, S.A., United States historical climatology network daily temperature, precipitation, and snow data for 1871-1997 (1999), ORNL/CDIAC-118, NDP-070.
