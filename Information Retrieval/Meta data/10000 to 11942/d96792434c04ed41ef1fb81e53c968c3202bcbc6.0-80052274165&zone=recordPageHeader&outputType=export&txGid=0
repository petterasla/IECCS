BC emissions influence the radiative balance in several ways through direct and semi-direct aerosol effects, as well as by impacting the surface albedo (Forster et al., 2007), and their net effect is likely a warming that enhances the total man-made warming. However, the role that BC or other short-lived heating components may play in future mitigation strategies must be formulated with caution to avoid unforeseen and unwanted consequences. A near-term mitigation of short-lived heating components could lead to a delayed action on CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases and thus an increased long-term warming. A key element is whether policies are designed as a consequence of predicted warming or observed warming. Without a clear strategy, early BC or ozone reductions may even lead to an unexpectedly larger temperature change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Black carbon; Mitigation strategy; Short-lived components","Aerosol effect; Black carbon; Black carbon aerosol; Forster; Key elements; Mitigation strategy; Net effect; Ozone precursors; Ozone reduction; Radiative balance; Short-lived components; Surface albedo; Temperature changes; Atmospheric aerosols; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Ozone; Heating; black carbon; carbon dioxide; ozone; aerosol; albedo; black carbon; carbon dioxide; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; heating; ozone; pollution control; radiation balance; albedo; article; carbon footprint; controlled study; environmental planning; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; particulate matter; priority journal",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Ackerman, A.S., Toon, O.B., Stevens, D.E., Heymsfield, A.J., Ramanathan, V., Reduction of tropical cloudiness by soot (2000) Science, 288 (5468), pp. 1042-1047; Bauer, S.E., Menon, S., Koch, D., Bond, T.C., Tsigaridis, K., A global modeling study on carbonaceous aerosol microphysical characteristics and radiative effects (2010) Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 10 (15), pp. 7439-7456; Berntsen, T., Fuglestvedt, J., Myhre, G., Stordal, F., Berglen, T.F., Abatement of greenhouse gases: does location matter?
