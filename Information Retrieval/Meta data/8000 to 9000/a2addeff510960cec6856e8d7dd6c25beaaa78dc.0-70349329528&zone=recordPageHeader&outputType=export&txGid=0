The BESS model estimates 25% lower life cycle GHG emissions for corn ethanol than does the wellknown GREET model, which raises questions about which model is more accurate. I develop a life cycle metamodel to compare the GREET and BESS models in detail and to explain why the results from these models diverge. I find two main reasons for the divergence: (1) BESS models a more efficient biorefinery than is modeled in the cases to which its results have been compared, and (2) in several instances BESS fails to properly count upstream emissions. Adjustments to BESS to account for these differences raise the estimated global warming intensity (not including land use change) of the corn ethanol pathway considered in that model from 45 to 61 g CO2e MJ-1. Adjusting GREET to use BESS's biorefinery performance and coproduct credit assumptions reduces the GREET estimate from 64 to 61 g CO2e MJ-1. Although this analysis explains the gap between the two models, both models would be improved with better data on corn production practices and by better treatment of agricultural inputs. © 2009 by Yale University.","Biofuel; Carbon emissions; Climate change; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)","Biorefineries; Carbon emissions; Coproduct; Corn production; Corn-ethanol; GHG emission; Industrial ecology; Land-use change; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle model; Meta model; Model estimates; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Industrial emissions; Land use; Laws and legislation; Leakage (fluid); Hybrid integrated circuits; accuracy assessment; biofuel; climate change; comparative study; emission inventory; environmental legislation; ethanol; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; Zea mays",,,,,,"Biasi, C., Lind, S.E., Pekkarinen, N.M., Huttunen, J.T., Shurpali, N.J., Hyvönen, N.P., Nen, N.P., Martikainen, P.J., Direct experimental evidence for the contribution of lime to CO 2 release from managed peat soil (2008) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 40 (10), pp. 2660-2669; Proposed regulation to implement the low carbon fuel standard (2009) Staff Report: Initial Statement of Reasons, 1. , CARB (California Air Resources Board)., Sacramento, CA: CARB; De Klein, C., Novoa, R.S.A., Ogle, S.M., Smith, K.A., Rochette, P., Wirth, T.C., Mcconkey, B.G., Rypdal., K., N2O emissions frommanaged soils, and CO2 emissions from lime and urea applications (2006) 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 4. , Agriculture, forestry and other land use, edited by S.
