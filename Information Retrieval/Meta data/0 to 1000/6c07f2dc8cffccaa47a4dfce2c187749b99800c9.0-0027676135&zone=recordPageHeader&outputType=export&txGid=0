A bioclimatic model relating the current distribution of vegetation to global climate patterns is used to examine the potential impacts of a global climate change on the global distribution of vegetation. Climate change scenarios are based on the predictions of two general circulation model equilibrium simulations for a 2XCO2 atmosphere. Current estimates of C reserves in the vegetation types and associated soils are then used to calculate changes in potential terrestrial C storage under the two climate change scenarios. Results suggest a potential negative feedback to increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2, with the potential for terrestrial C storage increasing under both scenarios. These results represent an equilibrium analysis, assuming the vegetation and soils have tracked the spatial changes in climate patterns. An approach for providing an estimate of the transient response between the two equilibria (i.e., current and 2XCO2 climates) is presented. The spatial transitions in vegetation predicted by the equilibrium analyses are classified as to the processes controlling the transition (eg., succession, dieback, species immigration). Estimates of the transfer rates related to these processes are then used to estimate the temporal dynamics of the vegetation/soils change and the associated C pools. Results suggest that although the equilibrium analyses show an increased potential for C storage under the climate change, in the transient case the terrestrial surface acts as a source of CO2 over the first 50 to 100 yrs following climate change. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"Analysis; Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Bioclimatic model; Climate change; Global terrestrial carbon storage; Negative feedback; Storage potential; Carbon; carbon; air pollution; atmosphere; biomass; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; measurement; methodology; soil; bioclimate; carbon dioxide doubling; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon storage; climate change; climatic change; general circulation model",,,,,,"Akima, H., A Method of Bivariate Interpolation and Smooth Surface Fitting for Irregularly Distributed Data Points (1978) ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 4, pp. 148-159; Bonan, G.B., Hayden, B.P., (1990) Quaternary Research, 33, pp. 204-218; Davis, M.B., (1976) Geoscience and Man, 13, pp. 13-26; Davis, M.B., Climatic instability, time lags and community disequilibrium (1984) Community Ecology., pp. 269-284. , J., Diamond, T.J., Case, Harper and Row, New York; Davis, M.B., (1989) Climatic Change, 15, pp. 75-82; Emanuel, W.R., Killough, G.G., Post, W.M., Shugart, H.H., Modeling Terrestrial Ecosystems in the Global Carbon Cycle With Shifts in Carbon Storage Capacity by Land-Use Change (1984) Ecology, 65, pp. 970-983; Emanuel, W.R., Shugart, H.H., Stevenson, M.P., (1985) Climatic Change, 7, pp. 29-43; Goudriaan, J., Ketner, P., (1984) Climatic Change, 6, pp. 167-192; Green, P.J., Sibson, R., (1978) The Computer Journal, 21, pp. 168-173; Hansen, J., Fung, I., Lacis, A., Rind, D., Russell, G., Lebedeff, S., Reudy, R., Stone, P., (1988) J.
