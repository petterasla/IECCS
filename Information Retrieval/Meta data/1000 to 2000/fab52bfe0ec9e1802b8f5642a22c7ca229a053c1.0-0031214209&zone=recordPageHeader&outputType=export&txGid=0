Studies and Research, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt","A study of the area, including Rosetta city and the estuary of the river Nile (Rosetta branch), has been carried out for assessment of the impact of sea level rise (slr). A geographic information system (GIS) has been built including layers of land use, topography, archeological sites, land cover and population. Analysis of data has been carried out to assess vulnerability of various land use and land cover classes to the impact of sea level rise. Because the area under study has geomorphic relief profiles just over the sea level, inundation of total land could reach 26% of total study area due to only half a meter rise in sea level. This lost area includes 32% of urban clusters mainly used for human shelter and contains 52% of present monuments, 25% of valuable high quality dense palm trees cultivation, 75% of beaches and 19% of lands suitable, 25% of valuable high quality dense palm trees cultivation, 75% of beaches and 19% of lands suitable for agricultural reclamation (although suffering from salt water intrusion and soil salinization). This is expected to cause a significant impact on the present population, economic activities, total regional revenue, and also on tourism. At 1.1 m sea level rise, 72% to total study area could be inundated. This area contains all beaches, half of the palm cultivation, 43% of total urban clusters, which includes 81% of the monumental sites and historic buildings. Other environmental problems such as solid waste management, sanitary disposal network, deteriorating conditions of some monumental structures, in addition to the sea level rise act negatively on the environmental quality of the urban community. Future plans for urban expansion in the area must be studied carefully in order to preserve valuable palm lands and maintain and protect monuments and historic sites which help the promotion of tourism. An environmental management program is essential for upgrading tourism, promoting urban development and protecting coastal lands.","Global warming; Nile delta; Urban land use; Vulnerability to climate change","Egypt; Land cover; Nile delta; Rosetta city; Sea rise; Topography; Vulnerability to climate change; Climate change; Environmental engineering; Environmental impact; Estuaries; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Land use; Rivers; Sea level; developing country; environmental impact; estuary; GIS; land use; land use planning; sea level rise; urban area; vulnerability; archeology; article; building; climate; egypt; environmental management; environmental monitoring; estuary; greenhouse effect; information system; land use; seashore; solid waste management; topography; tourism; tree; urban population; Egypt, Rosetta",,,,,,"Anany, I.L., Rosetta in History (1987) A Study in History, , Archeology and Tourism.
