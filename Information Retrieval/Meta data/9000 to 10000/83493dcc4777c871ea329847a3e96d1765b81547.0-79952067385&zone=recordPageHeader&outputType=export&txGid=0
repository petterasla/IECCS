The citrus temperature risk increases with increasing latitude (except for the western mountainous area of subtropics of China). The citrus precipitation risk in the central part of subtropics of China is higher than that in the northern and western parts. The distributions of citrus sunlight risk are not consistent to those of the citrus precipitation risk. The citrus climate risk is mainly influenced by temperature. There is latitudinal zonal law for the distribution of the climate risk, that is, the climate risk increases with increasing latitude. At the same time the climate risk in mountainous area is high and that in eastern plain area is low. There are differences in the temporal and spatial changes of the citrus climate. In recent 46 years, the citrus climate risk presents a gradual increasing trend in subtropics of China, especially it has been increasing fast since the 1980s. Because of the global warming, the low risk region in the eastern and southern parts has a gradual decreasing trend, however, the high risk region in the northern and western parts has an increasing trend and the high risk region has been extending eastward and southward. The article analyses the distribution of the citrus climate risk degree of reduction rates of >10%, >20% and >30% in subtropics of China, and studies their changes in different time periods. Results show that the risk is increasing from southeast to northwest. © 2010 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","citrus; climate change; climate risk degree; climate risk dynamic assessment model; climate suitability model; subtropics of China",,,,,,,"Bao, J., Xia, R., Peng, S., Effect of ecological factors on citrus fruit quality (2004) Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology, 15 (8), pp. 1477-1480; Camilo, L.M., Rogéria, P.S., Eduardo, C.M., Photosynthetic response of citrus grown under reflective aluminized polypropylene shading nets (2002) Scientia Horticulturae, 96, pp. 115-125; Chen, S., (1988) Fruit Meteorology, pp. 134-143. , Beijing: China Meteorological Press; Cynthia, R., Jennifer, P., Richard, G., Potential impacts of climate change on citrus and potato production in the US (1996) Agricultural Systems, 52, pp. 455-479; Duan, H., Qian, H., Assessing the temperature risk to longan planting in South China (2009) Geographical Research, 28 (4), pp. 1095-1104; Duan, H., Qian, H., Yu, F., Temperature suitability of longan and its changes in South China area (2008) Acta Ecologica Sinica, 28 (11), pp. 5303-5313; Gao, Y., Jia, J., Wang, Y., Effect of meteorological condition on the development of citrus flower bud (1995) China Citrus, 24 (2), pp. 12-14; Gao, Y., Jia, J., Wang, Y., Effect of meteorological condition on the fruit development of citrus (1995) China Citrus, 24 (2), pp. 17-19; Gao, Y., Yi, X., Tao, L., A study on climatic ecology of the phenophase in citrus (1999) Journal of Southwest Agricultural University, 21 (6), pp. 514-547; Huang, H., A study on the climatic ecology adaptability of the crop production in the red and yellow soils region of China (1996) Journal of Natural Resources, 11 (4), pp. 340-345; Huang, S., Agrometeorological index of citrus freeze injury in foreign (1980) Fujian Fruit, 2, pp. 26-29; Huang, S., Study on the ecological divisions of tangering plantation in Zhejiang Province (1985) Chinese Journal of Ecology, 4, pp. 1-4; Climate Change 2007: Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (2007) Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Climate Change 2007: The physical science basis (2007) Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Li, Z., Li, W., The effect of water-fertilizer conditions on crop's niche-fitness and yield in semi-arid regions of the Loess Plateau (2003) Acta Botanica Boreali-Occidentalia Sinica, 23 (1), pp. 28-33; Liu, Q., Qian, H., Ren, Y., Temperature suitability of cotton and its change in Henan Province (2004) Resources Science, 26 (4), pp. 51-56; Luo, H., Quantitative studies on the climatic ecology of citrus L. in the warm gorge sectors (2002) Chinese Journal of Ecology, 21 (4), pp. 22-25; Ma, S., (1994) Agriculture Climate Research in Jilin Province, pp. 32-178. , Beijing: China Meteorological Press; Qian, H., Jiao, S., Zhao, F., Climate suitability change of winter wheat in Henan Province (2005) Chinese Journal of Ecology, 24 (5), pp. 503-507; Ren, Y., Qian, H., Liu, Q., Analysis of climatic suitability of cotton in Henan Province (2004) Research of Agricultural Modernization, 25 (3), pp. 231-235; Shen, Z., (1989) Citrus and Climate, pp. 89-91. , Chongqing: Chongqing Press; Tang, J., Chen, X., Zhao, M., Numerical simulation of regional climate change under IPCC A2 scenario in China (2008) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 66 (1), pp. 13-25; Xu, C., (2004) Index of Agrometeorology, pp. 114-115. , Beijing: China Meteorological Press; Xu, X., Gao, P., Jiang, D., Fuzzy analysis on the suitability of precipitation to the agro-crops growing in Yan'an City (2000) Research of Soil and Water Conservation, 7 (2), pp. 73-76; Xue, C., Huo, Z., Li, S., Geographic distribution of winter wheat yield loss risk and its classification in North China (2005) Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology, 16 (4), pp. 620-625; Yi, X., Gao, Y., Zhang, C., Effects of meteorological condition on physiological fruit drop of citrus (1995) China Citrus, 24 (2), pp. 15-16; Yu, F., Qian, H., Duan, H., Cropping rice climate suitability and its changes in Huaihe River basin (2008) Scientia Geographica Sinica, 28 (4), pp. 537-542; Zhao, F., Qian, H., Jiao, S., Study of the climatic suitability model of crop (2003) Resources Science, 25 (6), pp. 77-82; Zhu, W., Changes of winter temperature impact on rape and citrus and wheat production (1995) Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology, 16 (6), pp. 28-31","Qian, H.; School of Geographical Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou 510006, China; email: hsqian1956@163.com",,,,,,,,1009637X,,,,"English","J.
