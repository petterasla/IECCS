Most of this growth will occur in the developing countries of Asia, where there is an enormous unmet demand for contraception, while an increasing number of developed countries will have declining populations. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic will target developing countries, with India destined to become its new epicenter. By 2050, there may be 1 billion HIV-infected people in the world. The significant protective effect of male circumcision may spare Islamic countries, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Indonesia, from the worst effects of the pandemic. Australia will be increasingly threatened by the high rates of population growth of her Asian neighbours. This, coupled with political instability and sea-level rises as a consequence of global warming, will turn the present trickle of refugees from a variety of Asian countries seeking safe haven on our sparsely populated northern coastline into a veritable flood. There will come a time when we have neither the manpower, nor the means, nor even the moral right to intercept, detain or repatriate the thousands who will come in peace, in search of a better life. However, if Australia is to stabilize its future population at around 23 million, which seems highly desirable on ecological grounds, then the net immigration rate must be limited to approximately 50000 people per year. Because the final point of departure for all these refugees is Indonesia, it is essential that Australia maintains good relations with Indonesia, so that together we can attempt to manage the refugee problem. However, Indonesia's own population is destined to increase by 100 million in the next 50 years, which will only exacerbate the situation. Australia would be well advised to make a major increase in its paltry financial assistance to Indonesia's excellent family planning programmes, which are currently starved of funds. Helping Indonesia to contain its population growth is Australia's best long-term investment for its own future.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; Asia; Australia; Bangladesh; child; circumcision; contraception; controlled study; developing country; ecology; family planning; female; fertility; financial management; greenhouse effect; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; India; Indonesia; infant; Iran; male; Pakistan; population growth; population migration; refugee; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Australia; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Fertility; Humans; Indonesia; International Cooperation; Population Growth; Human immunodeficiency virus",,,,,,"'An Essay on the Principle of Population, as it Affects the Future Improvement of Society With Remarks on the Speculations of Mr Godwin, M.
