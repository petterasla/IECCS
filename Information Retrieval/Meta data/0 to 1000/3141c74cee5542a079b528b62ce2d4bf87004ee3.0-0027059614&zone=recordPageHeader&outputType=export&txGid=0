The composition of benthic foraminiferal assemblages and the iron abundance in peats were used to describe shifts in marsh environment through time quantitatively. The resulting sea-level rise curve, with age control from 14C dating and the onset of anthropogenic metal pollution, shows strong increases in the rate of relative sea-level rise during modern global warming (since the late nineteenth century), but not during the Little Climate Optimum (AD 1000-1300). There is virtually no rise in sea-level during the Little Ice Age (AD 1400-1700). One period of accelerated sea-level rise may have occurred between about AD 1200 and 1450, which was the transition for the Little Climate Optimum to the Little Ice Age, ie a period of cooling (at least in northwestern Europe). Local changes in tidal range might also have contributed to this apparent increase in the rate of relative sea-level, however. The second period of accelerated sea-level rise occured during the period of modern global warming that started at the end of the last century. -from Authors",,"climate change; coastal salt marsh; Little Climate Optimum; Little Ice Age; metal pollution; salt marsh; sea level rise; USA, Connecticut, Clinton",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,09544879,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027059614
