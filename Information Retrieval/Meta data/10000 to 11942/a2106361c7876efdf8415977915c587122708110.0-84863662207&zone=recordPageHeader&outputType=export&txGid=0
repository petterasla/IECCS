The present study focuses on the trends in the Sea Ice Extent (SIE) over different sectors of the Arctic and the Antarctic regions and the interannual variability in their extremes. In general, the data over the period (1979-2007) reveal marked interannual variability in the sea ice cover with an increasing and the decreasing trend over the Antarctic and the Arctic region respectively. Over the southern hemisphere, only the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas sector shows an exceptional decreasing trend. However, in the northern hemisphere, all the sectors show a decreasing trend, with the Kara and Barents Seas sector being the most prominent one. Although, the decreasing trend of the SIE over the Arctic could be attributed to the global warming, an intriguing question still remains as to why the other polar region shows a different behaviour.","Climate change; Cryosphere; Global change; Global warming; Sea ice extent",,,,,,,"Bjorgo, E., Johannessen, O.M., Miles, M.W., Analysis of merged SMMR-SSMI time series of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice parameters 1978-1995 (1997) Geophysical Research Letters, 24 (4), pp. 413-416; Brix, H., Gerdes, R., North Atlantic deep water and Antarctic bottom water: Their interaction and influence on the variability of the global ocean circulation (2003) Journal of Geophysical Research, 108, pp. 4-17; Budd, W.F., Antarctic sea-ice variations from satellite sensing in relation to climate (1975) Journal of Glaciology, 15 (73), pp. 417-427; Campbell, W.J., Gloersen, P., Zwally, H.J., Aspects of Arctic Sea Ice Observable by Sequential Passive-Microwave Observations from the Nimbus-5 Satellite (1984) Arctic Technology and Policy, pp. 197-222. , I.
