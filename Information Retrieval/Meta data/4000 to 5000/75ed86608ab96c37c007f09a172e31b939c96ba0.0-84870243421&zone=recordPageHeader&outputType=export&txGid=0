Anticipated impacts are generally increased evaporation at low latitudes and increased precipitation at middle and high latitudes. General Circulation Models (GCMs) used to simulate climate disagree on whether the U.S. as a whole and its constituent regions will receive more or less precipitation as global warming occurs. The impacts on specific regions will depend on changes in weather patterns and are certain to be complex. Here we apply the suite of 12 potential climate change scenarios, previously described in Part 1, to the Hydrologic Unit Model of the United States (HUMUS) to simulate water supply in the conterminous United States in reference to a baseline scenario. We examine the sufficiency of this water supply to meet changing demands of irrigated agriculture. The changes in water supply driven by changes in climate will likely be most consequential in the semi-arid western parts of the country where water yield is currently scarce and the resource is intensively managed. Changes of greater than ±50% with respect to present day water yield are projected in parts of the Midwest and Southwest U.S. Interannual variability in the water supply is likely to increase where conditions become drier and to decrease under wetter conditions. © 2005 Springer.",,,,,,,,"Alcamo, J., Henrichs, T., Rosch, T., (2000) World Water in 2025: Global Modeling and Scenario Analysis for the World Water Commission on Water for the 21st Century, , Kassel World Water Series, Report Number 2, Center for Environmental Systems Research, University of Kassel; Allen, R.G., Gichuki, F.N., Rosenzweig, C., CO2 induced climatic changes and irrigation water requirements (1991) J.
