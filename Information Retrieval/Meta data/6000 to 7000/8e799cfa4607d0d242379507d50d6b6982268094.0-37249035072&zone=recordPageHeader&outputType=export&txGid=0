With the use of spatial techniques like remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems, and Global Positioning Systems, EIA has enhanced substantial viewing, movement, query, and even map-making capabilities. However, one of the main challenges is to have access to the most up-to-date and accurate geospatial data and interpretations. With an emphasis on using geospatial data in particular, the value of the information resource is far higher than is generally available with text and numeric information. This paper focuses on discussing the application of geospatial tools in environmental monitoring and the effective analysis of the natural resources for developmental planning, policy formulation, and decision-making. Several specific relevant applications of geospatial tools to integrate EIA are presented in the context of an Indian scenario. Applications have included monitoring of natural resources (air, water, land, etc.), ground-level ozone, soil erosion, study of sea-level rise due to global warming, change-detection studies, delineation of ecologically sensitive areas using digital-image analysis and Geographic Information Systems. This study focuses on the possibility of using a proposed spatial-decision-support system to conduct EIA, which should make it possible to upload, evaluate, maintain, and report field and analytical data that have been stored in a variety of formats.",,"Decision making; Decision support systems; Geographic information systems; Global positioning system; Mapping; Remote sensing; Developmental planning; Geospatial technology; Policy formulation; Environmental impact assessments; decision making; decision support system; detection method; environmental disturbance; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental policy; GIS; GPS; remote sensing; spatial analysis; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",,,,,,"Arimoro, A.O., Fagbeja, M.A., Eedy, W., The need and use of geographic information systems for environmental impact assessment in Africa: With example from ten years experience in Nigeria (2002) JEAM/RAGEE, 4, pp. 16-27; Bobrowsky, P.T., (2002) Geo-environmental Mapping: Methods, Theory and Practice, 27, pp. 143-153; Cartalis, C., Varotsos, C., Surface ozone in Athens, Greece, at the beginning and at the end of the 20th-century (1994) Atmospheric Environment, 28, pp. 3-8; Eedy, W., The use of GIS in environmental impact assessment (1995) Assessment and Project Appraisal (IAPA), 13, pp. 199-206; Efstathiou, M.N., Varotsos, C.A., Singh, R.P., Cracknell, A.P., Tzanis, C., On the longitude dependence of total ozone trends over middle-latitudes (2003) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 24, pp. 1361-1367; Erickson, P.A., (1994) A Practical Guide to Environmental Impact Assessment, , Academic Press, New York; Gontier, M., Balfors, B., Mortberg, U., Biodiversity in environmental assessment - Current practice and tools for prediction (2006) Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 26, p. 268; Griffith, C., Geographic Information Systems and environmental impact assessment (1980) Environmental Management, 4, pp. 21-25; Hassan, H., (1995) Implementing Geographic Information Systems in Environmental Assessment.
