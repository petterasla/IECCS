We used major vegetation types (biomes) as proxies for natural habitats and, based on projected future biome distributions under doubled-CO2 climates, calculated changes in habitat areas and associated extinctions of endemic plant and vertebrate species in biodiversity hotspots. Because of numerous uncertainties in this approach, we undertook a sensitivity analysis of multiple factors that included (1) two global vegetation models, (2) different numbers of biome classes in our biome classification schemes, (3) different assumptions about whether species distributions were biome specific or not, and (4) different migration capabilities. Extinctions were calculated using both species-area and endemic-area relationships. In addition, average required migration rates were calculated for each hotspot assuming a doubled-CO 2 climate in 100 years. Projected percent extinctions ranged from &lt;1 to 43% of the endemic biota (average 11.6%), with biome specificity having the greatest influence on the estimates, followed by the global vegetation model and then by migration and biome classification assumptions. Bootstrap comparisons indicated that effects on hotpots as a group were not significantly different from effects on random same-biome collections of grid cells with respect to biome change or migration rates; in some scenarios, however, hotspots exhibited relatively high biome change and low migration rates. Especially vulnerable hotspots were the Cape Floristic Region, Caribbean, Indo-Burma, Mediterranean Basin, Southwest Australia, and Tropical Andes, where plant extinctions per hotspot sometimes exceeded 2000 species. Under the assumption that projected habitat changes were attained in 100 years, estimated global-warming-induced rates of species extinctions in tropical hotspots in some cases exceeded those due to deforestation, supporting suggestions that global warming is one of the most serious threats to the planet's biodiversity. © 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Biomes; Climate change; General circulation models; Global vegetation models; Migration; Species extinctions","biodiversity; biome; extinction; global warming; article; biodiversity; biological model; energy conservation; greenhouse effect; methodology; Biodiversity; Conservation of Energy Resources; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Biological; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Achard, F., Eva, H.D., Stibig, H., Mayaux, P., Gallego, J., Richards, T., Malingreau, J., Determination of deforestation rates of the world's humid tropical forests (2002) Science, 297, pp. 999-1002. , and; Arita, H.T., Rodriguez, P., Geographic range, turnover rate and the scaling of species diversity (2002) Ecography, 25, pp. 541-550. , and; Brooks, T.M., Habitat loss and extinction in the hotspots of biodiversity (2002) Conservation Biology, 16, pp. 909-923; Clark, J.S., Why trees migrate so fast: Confronting theory with dispersal biology and the paleorecord (1998) The American Naturalist, 152, pp. 204-224; Collingham, Y.C., Hill, M.O., Huntley, B., The migration of sessile organisms: A simulation model with measurable parameters (1996) Journal of Vegetation Science, 7, pp. 831-846. , and; Davis, A.J., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Jenkinson, L.S., Individualistic species responses invalidate simple physiological models of community dynamics under global environmental change (1998) Journal of Animal Ecology, 67, pp. 600-612. , and; Davis, A.J., Jenkinson, L.S., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Wood, S., Making mistakes when predicting shifts in species range in response to global warming (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 783-786. , and; Dyer, J.M., Assessment of climatic warming using a model of forest species migration (1995) Ecological Modelling, 79, pp. 199-219; Enquist, C.A.F., Predicted regional impacts of climate change on the geographical distribution and diversity of tropical forests in Costa Rica (2002) Journal of Biogeography, 29, pp. 519-534; Harris, L.D., Cropper Jr., W.P., Between the devil and the deep blue sea: Implications of climate change for Florida's fauna (1992) Global Warming and Biological Diversity, pp. 309-324inand. , Pages.
