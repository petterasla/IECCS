Research Centre of Finland, Institute of Plant Protection, FIN-31600 Jokioinen, Finland","The impact of climate warming on yield losses caused by potato late blight and on the need for disease control was studied by constructing models for timing late blight epidemics and a model of potato growth constrained by late blight. Empirical models predicting the date of planting and emergence of potato were based on thermal time, and a model predicting the date of late blight outbreak was based on thermal time on rainy days. Experiments were conducted over 3 years under ambient and elevated (+3°C) temperatures to obtain parameter values for the growth model. Potato emergence is predicted to occur at 631 degree days accumulated above 0°C after the 16-day running mean temperature in spring exceeds 0°C. A blight outbreak is predicted to occur when the effective temperature sum accumulated above 8°C after potato emergence, on days with at least 0.1 mm of precipitation, achieves 156 degree days. In the prediction of the outbreak the maximum daily accumulation of temperature is limited to 10 degree days. A preliminary sensitivity study carried out at one site in southern Finland suggests that over a range of 1 to 3°C warming, the period during which late blight needs to be controlled by fungicide applications would be 10-20 days longer per 1°C of warming. The increase in yield loss of unprotected crops would be of the same magnitude as the increase in yield potential, around 2 t/ha of dry matter per 1°C of warming.","Climatic change; Model; Phytophthora infestans; Risk evaluation",,,,,,,"Ashenden, T.W., Baxter, R., Rafarel, C.R., An inexpensive system for exposing plants in field to elevated concentrations of CO2 (1992) Plant, Cell and Environment, 15, pp. 365-372; Beaumont, A., The dependence on the weather of the dates of outbreak of potato late blight epidemics (1947) Transactions of the British Mycological Society, 31, pp. 45-53; Bourke, P.M.A., The forecasting from weather data of potato blight and other plant diseases and pests (1955) WMO Technical Note, 10; Bowes, G., Facing the inevitable: Plants and increasing atmospheric CO2 (1993) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Molecular Biology, 44, pp. 309-332; Carter, T.R., Saarikko, R.A., Niemi, K.J., Assessing the risks and uncertainties of regional crop potential under a changing climate in Finland (1996) Agricultural and Food Science in Finland, 5 (THIS ISSUE), pp. 329-350; Coakley, S.M., Variation in climate and prediction of disease in plants (1988) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 26, pp. 163-181; Crosier, W., (1934) Studies in the Biology of Phytophthora Infestans (Mont.) de Bary, p. 155. , Cornell University Memorandum; Croxall, H.E., Smith, L.P., The epidemiology of potato late blight in the East Midlands 1923-74 (1976) Annals of Applied Biology, 82, pp. 451-466; Firman, D.M., Allen, E.J., Relationship between light interception, ground cover and leaf area index in potatoes (1989) Journal of Agricultural Science, Cambridge, 113, pp. 355-359; Hakala, K., Kaukoranta, T., Mela, T., Laurila, H., Arrangement of experiments for simulating the effects of elevated temperatures and elevated CO2 on field sown crops in Finland (1996) Agricultural and Food Science in Finland, 5, pp. 25-47; Hansen, J.G., Andersson, B., Hermansen, A., NEGFRY - A system for scheduling chemical control of late blight in potatoes (1995) Phytophthora Infestans, 150, pp. 201-208. , Dowley, L.
