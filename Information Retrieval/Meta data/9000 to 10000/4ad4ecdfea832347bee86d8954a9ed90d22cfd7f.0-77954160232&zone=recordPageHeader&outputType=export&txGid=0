However, the effects of these factors on species distribution and abundance at sea are still poorly understood, particularly in marine ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. Using a unique long-term data set of at-sea observations, we tested for interdecadal (1980s vs. 2000s) changes in summer abundance and distribution of 12 species of Albatrosses and Petrels along a 30° latitudinal gradient between tropical and Antarctic waters of the southern Indian Ocean. There were contrasting effects of climate change on subantarctic seabird distribution and abundance at sea. While subtropical waters showed the highest rate of warming, the species that visited this water mass showed the greatest changes in distribution and abundance. The abundance of Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans), White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) and Giant Petrels (Macronectes sp.) declined markedly, whereas the other species showed contrasting trends or did not change. With the exception of the White-chinned Petrel, these decreases were at least partly related to regional increase in sea surface temperature. The southward shift of Wandering Albatross and Prions (Pachyptila spp.) distributions could be ascribed to species redistribution or decrease in abundance due to warming of the subtropical waters. Surprisingly, White-chinned Petrel distribution shifted northward, suggesting more complex mechanisms. This study is the first to document a shift in species range in the Southern Ocean related to climate change and contrasting abundance changes. It suggests that some species might experience more severe impacts from climate change depending on the water masses they visit. As climate changes are predicted to continue in the next decades, understanding species responses to climate change is crucial for conservation management, especially when their conservation status is critical or unknown. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","At-sea survey; Bayesian; Climate change; Mixture model; Populations trends; Procellariiform; Zero inflation","abundance; Bayesian analysis; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; decadal variation; latitudinal gradient; population distribution; sea surface temperature; seabird; summer; trend analysis; warming; water mass; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (South); Diomedea exulans; Diomedeidae; Macronectes; Pachyptila; Procellaria aequinoctialis; Procellariidae; Procellariiformes",,,,,,"Aebischer, N.J., Wanless, S., Relationships between colony size, adult non-breeding and environmental conditions for Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis on the Isle of May, Scotland (1992) Bird Study, 39, pp. 43-52; Ainley, D.G., Ribic, C.A., Fraser, W.R., Ecological structure among migrant and resident seabirds of the Scotia-Weddell Confluence region (1994) Journal of Animal Ecology, 63, pp. 347-364; Alerstam, T., Gudmundsson, G.A., Larsson, B., Flight tracks and speeds of Antarctic and Atlantic seabirds: radar and optical measurements (1993) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 340, pp. 55-67; Altwegg, R., Wheeler, M., Erni, B., Climate and the range dynamics of species with imperfect detection (2008) Biology Letters, 4, pp. 581-584; Atkinson, A., Siegel, V., Pakhomov, E., et al, Long-term decline in krill stock and increase in salps within the Southern Ocean (2004) Nature, 432, pp. 100-103; Ballance, L.T., Understanding seabirds at sea: why and how?
