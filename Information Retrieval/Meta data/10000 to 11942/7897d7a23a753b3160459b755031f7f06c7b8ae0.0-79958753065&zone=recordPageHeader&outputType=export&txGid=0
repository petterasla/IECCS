It focuses on cane processing in sugar mills and is a companion to the work presented in (Renouf et al. 2010), where the focus is on cane growing. This work also examines the preferred approach for assigning impacts to the multiple products from cane processing, and the influence that variability in cane growing has on the results. Method Initially, global warming potentials were generated for a range of cane processing models, using economic allocation (EA), mass allocation (MA), and system expansion (SE). A preferred approach was identified and applied to generate results for a wider set of impact categories based on the Impact 2002+ method. Uncertainty in the results due to cane-growing variability was assessed using Monte Carlo analysis and compared with the results for substitute products to determine the significance of the variability. Results While the generation of results using SE was appealing for assessing the determining product (raw sugar), it was found to be less valid for the co-products (molasses, electricity, and ethanol). Results could be generated more consistently across all products using allocation. MA was found to be best suited to sugarcane products, whereas EA posed some problems. The uncertainty due to variability in sugarcane growing was found to be significantly higher than that of substitute products. Conclusions and recommendations LCA results for sugarcane products are influenced by (1) the nature of cane processing system, (2) variability in sugarcane growing, and (3) the approach taken for assigning impacts to the multiple products from sugarcane processing. The first two factors imply that results should be specific to the cane-growing region and the cane processing used to produce them. In relation to the latter issue, for generating attributional LCA results that are consistent across all sugarcane products, the recommended approach is to use mass allocation (with energy allocation for bagasse combustion and cogeneration). © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Allocation; Electricity; Ethanol; Molasses; Sugar; System expansion; Variability","alcohol; molasses; sugar; article; Australia; bioenergy; controlled study; crop production; environmental impact assessment; food composition; food industry; food processing; greenhouse effect; intermethod comparison; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; plant growth; priority journal; process model; resource allocation; sugarcane",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; molasses, 68476-78-8",,,,"Australian commodities data-sugar (2004) Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, , www.abare.gov.au, ABARE; Andrae, A.S.G., (2009) Global Life-cycle Impact Assessment Ofmaterial Shifts: The Example of A Pb-free Electronics Industry, , Springer, London; (2006) Australian Sugar Year Book 2006, , Rural Press Limited, Brisbane; Beeharry, R.P., Carbon balance of sugarcane bioenergy systems (2001) Biomass and Bioenergy, 20 (5), pp. 361-370. , DOI 10.1016/S0961-9534(00)00094-5, PII S0961953400000945; Beer, T., Grant, T., Brown, R., (2000) Life Cycle Emissions Analysis of Alternative Fuels for Heavy Vehicles CSIRO Atmospheric Research Report to the Australian Greenhouse Office, , Report no.
