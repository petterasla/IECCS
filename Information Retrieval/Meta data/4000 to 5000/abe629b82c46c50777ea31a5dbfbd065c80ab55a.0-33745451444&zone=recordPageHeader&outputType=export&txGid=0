In this paper, the prehistoric record for pikas in the Great Basin is used to place these losses in deeper historical context. Location: The Great Basin, or area of internal drainage, of the western United States. Methods: The location, elevation, and age of all reported prehistoric Great Basin specimens of American pikas were extracted from the literature. Elevations of extinct pika populations were arrayed through time, and latitudes and longitudes of those populations used to determine changing distances of those populations from the nearest extant populations. Results: The average elevation of now-extinct Great Basin pika populations during the late Wisconsinan (c. 40,000-10,000 radiocarbon years ago) and early Holocene (c. 10,000-7500 years ago) was 1750 m. During the hot and dry middle Holocene (c. 7500-4500 years ago), the average elevation of these populations rose 435 m, to 2168 m. All prehistorically known late Holocene (c. 4500-200 years ago) populations in the Great Basin are from mountain ranges that currently support populations of this animal, but historic period losses have caused the average elevation of pika populations to rise an additional 152 m. The total elevational increase, from the late Wisconsinan and early Holocene to today, has been 783 m. As lower elevation pika populations were lost, their distribution increasingly came to resemble its modern form. During the late Wisconsinan, now-extinct pika populations were located an average of 170 km from the nearest extant population. By the late Holocene, this distance had declined to 30 km. Main conclusions: Prehistoric alterations in the distribution of pika population in the Great Basin were driven by climate change and attendant impacts on vegetation. Today, Great Basin pikas contend with both climate change and anthropogenic impacts and thus may be on the brink of extinction. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Extinction; Global warming; Great Basin; Ochotona princeps; Pikas","extinction; population distribution; prehistoric; small mammal; Basin and Range Province; Great Basin; North America; United States; Animalia; Ochotona princeps; Ochotonidae",,,,,,"Beever, E.A., Brussard, P.F., Berger, J., Patterns of apparent extinction among isolated populations of pikas (Ochotona princeps) in the Great Basin (2003) Journal of Mammalogy, 84, pp. 37-54; Benson, L.V., Kashgarian, M., Rye, R., Lund, S., Paillet, F., Smoot, J., Kester, C., Lindström, S., Holocene multidecadal and multicentennial droughts affecting northern California and Nevada (2002) Quaternary Science Reviews, 21, pp. 659-682; Bole Jr., B.P., Some high altitude records for mammals in the Inyo-White mountains of California (1938) Journal of Mammalogy, 19, pp. 245-246; Brown, J.H., Mammals on mountaintops: Nonequilibrium insular biogeography (1971) American Naturalist, 105, pp. 467-478; Brown, J.H., The theory of insular biogeography and the distribution of boreal birds and mammals (1978) Great Basin Naturalist Memoirs, 2, pp. 209-227. , ed. by.
