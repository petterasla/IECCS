Soil C contents indicated that east of the Southern Alps, increased decomposition of organic matter with global warming would provide a positive feedback to further increase in atmospheric CO2. This decrease in New Zealand's soil C, could contribute about 0.5×1015g C to the atmosphere over the next 60 yrs. These conclusions were generally supported by changes in soil C turnover estimated from ""bomb' 14C enrichment. The unexpectedly slow turnover found for two soils was explained by a ""memory' effect from the former southern beech forest that grew on these soils in prehistoric times. Accumulation of Al-humus under the forest may be responsible for the slow C turnover observed. -from Author",,"carbon dioxide; carbon storage; climate change; global warming; grassland soil; New Zealand, South Island",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00224588,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027065848
