Crop residue management should serve a double function, both confronting global warming and food security by increasing carbon sequestration in agriculture and increasing grain yields. Historically, the North China Plain has experienced different crop residue management practices. While direct burning in the field remains an environmental problem in the region, crop residue amendment triggers benign cycling of C and nutrients in agriculture. Data showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) in topsoil increased by 0.174 to 1.74 g kg-1, with an average of 0.79 g kg-1 after wheat residue amendment collected from 35 sites in the North China Plain. The average increase in grain yield achieved by wheat residue amendment in the region is 260 kg ha-1 year-1 for wheat and 310 kg ha-1 year-1 for maize, for a total of 570 kg ha-1 year-1. At the same time, the available potassium (K2O), the available phosphorus (P2O5), and total nitrogen in soil increased, significantly or not. With the development of the economy, technology, and supporting policy, crop residue management can play an increasingly important role in sustainable agricultural development.","Crop residue; Management; North China Plain; Soil organic carbon (SOC); Sustainable agriculture","Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",,,,,,"Fan, B.Q., Liu, Q.L., Effect of conservation tillage and straw application on the soil microorganism and P dissolving characteristics (2005) Chinese Journal of Eco-Agriculture, 13, pp. 130-132. , in Chinese; Han, L.J., Yan, Q.J., Liu, X.Y., Hu, J.Y., Straw resources and their utilization in China (2002) Transactions of the CSAE, 18, pp. 87-91. , in Chinese; He, N.Z., Lin, X.Y., Lin, R.X., Zhu, B.L., Huang, Z.L., Li, M.Y., Zhang, W.M., Wang, Z.D., Impacts of mulch and bury on N, P and K release contained in crop residue (1995) Chinese journal of Soil Science, 26 (7), pp. 40-42. , in Chinese; Jacinthe, P.A., Lal, R., Kimble, J.M., Carbon budget and seasonal carbon dioxide emission from a central Ohio Luvisol as influenced by wheat residue amendment (2002) Soil & Tillage Research, 67, pp. 147-157; Lal, R., Residue management, conservation tillage and soil restoration for mitigating greenhouse effect by CO2-enrichment (1997) Soil & Tillage Research, 43, pp. 81-107; Lao, X.R., Wu, Z.Y., Gao, Y.C., Effect of long term returning straw on soil fertility (2002) Transactions of the CSAE, 18, pp. 49-52. , in Chinese; Liu, G.D., (2004) Methods and applications to evaluate the regional agricultural impacts on recourses and environments - A case study on high-yielding county, Huantai, North China, , PhD dissertation, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China in Chinese; Paustian, K., Andren, O., Janzen, H.H., Lal, R., Smith, P., Tian, G., Tiessen, H., Woomer, P.L., Agricultural soils as a sink to mitigate CO2 emissions (1997) Soil Use and Management, 13, pp. 230-244; Shen, Y.H., Huang, X.G., Wang, H.Q., Field effects of straw mulching (1998) Agricultural Research in Arid Areas, 16 (1), pp. 45-50. , in Chinese; Smil, V., Crop residues: Agriculture's largest harvest (1999) Bioscience, 49, pp. 299-308; Sun, W.H., Lao, X.R., Dong, Y.L., Bi, J.J., Impacts on grain yield and soil K of crop residue amendment in wheat-maize rotation (2004) Crops, 4, pp. 14-16. , in Chinese; Wang, Y., Sun, K.G., Jiao, Y., Guo, Z.Y., Wu, C.X., Li, R.P., Study on the fixed site trials for the combined application of K fertilizer and straw in Henan major soil types (1996) Henan Agricultural Science, 1, pp. 20-24. , in Chinese; Yang, W.Y., Wang, L.Y., Present situation and prospects of returning application of crop straw (1999) Journal of Sichuan Agricultural University, 17 (2), pp. 211-216. , in Chinese; Yuan, J.F., Effects of straw mulch in wheat field and its effect on yield increase (1996) Eco-Agriculture Research, 4 (3), pp. 61-65. , in Chinese; Zeng, M.X., Zhang, Y.J., Effects of returning straw into the field on farmland eco-environment (1997) Agro-environment & Development, 14 (1), pp. 1-7. , in Chinese; Zeng, M.X., Jin, W.X., Zhao, X.Y., Li, X., Appropriate situations of wheat residue amendment in the North China Plain (1995) Soil & Fertilizers, 4, pp. 30-36. , in Chinese; Zeng, M.X., Wang, R.F., Peng, S.Q., Zhang, Y.J., Cui, Y., Shan, X.Z., Liao, C.Z., Tian, Y.G., Summary of returning straw into field of main agricultural areas in China (2002) Chinese Journal of Soil Science, 33 (5), pp. 336-339. , in Chinese; Zhang, Q.Z., (2006) Contribution of crop residue amendment to carbon sequestration in the high-yielding grain region of North China Plain, , PhD dissertation, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China in Chinese; Zhao, C.X., (2004) Effects of different crop straw return and fertilizer input on crop growth in high-yielding agro-ecosystems, , Master's thesis, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China in Chinese","Wu, W.; College of Resources and Environmental Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100094, China; email: wuwenl@cau.edu.cn",,,,,,,,10440046,,,,"English","J.
