However, this is not self-evident, since water vapor content in the atmosphere may be significantly affected by atmospheric convections, such as cumulus convection, which involve strong vertical motions of air. To find an explanation, global warming experiments were run in this study that included atmospheres at radiative-convective equilibrium with differing amounts of a noncondensable greenhouse gas. The models used were the dynamical convection model (DCM) and kinematic circulation model (KCM). When the noncondensable greenhouse gas is increased in the models, the free atmosphere in both the DCM and KCM show similar increases in air temperature and water vapor content. Changes in temperature and water vapor occur such that the relative humidity remains mostly constant. As Iwasa et al. show, water vapor distribution is controlled by a net circulation that is driven by radiative cooling. It is not convectively forced. Relative humidity is unchanged because the net circulation that increases temperature leaves the subsidence flow pattern similar. The DCM reveals a new aspect of global warming. The vertical temperature profile in the dry convective boundary layer (CBL) becomes dry adiabatic, a lapse rate larger than the moist adiabatic lapse rate in the free troposphere. Both the depth of the CBL and tropospheric temperatures increase. The development of the CBL accompanies an additional temperature increase in the bottom atmosphere and at the surface, in contrast to temperature profiles predicted from models without such CBL structures. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Earth atmosphere; Greenhouses; Heat convection; Humidity control; Mathematical models; Moisture control; Troposphere; Vapors; Atmospheric convections; Dynamic convection models (DCM); Greenhouse gases; Global warming; climate change; convective boundary layer; global warming; greenhouse gas; temperature profile; water vapor",,,,,,"Betts, A.K., Ridgeway, W., Climatic equilibrium of the atmospheric convective boundary layer over the tropical ocean (1989) J.
