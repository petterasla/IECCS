These are climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion (increased UV-B radiation), acidic deposition, SMOG (increased ground-level ozone), suspended particulate matter, and hazardous air pollutants. Atmospheric scientists and decision makers have largely addressed these issues individually resulting in single-issue policies. However, it is now recognized that these issues are inter-related, and they may interact to cause negative as well as some beneficial effects, not only on the state of the atmosphere but also on societal and ecological systems. This paper illustrates through several examples the atmospheric dysfunction caused by the linkages among the six air issues. It also points to potentially conflicting policies arising from the single-issue approach, and it emphasizes the need for better integration of air issues. The linkages are summarized qualitatively in Table I.","Acidic deposition; Air issues; Air toxics; Climate change; Global warming; Ground-level ozone; Hazardous air pollutants; Smog; Stratospheric ozone depletion; Suspended particulate matter; UV-B radiation","ozone; acid rain; air pollutant; canada; climate; conference paper; greenhouse effect; policy; suspended particulate matter; Acid rain; Air quality; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Global warming; Ozone layer; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Ultraviolet radiation; Ozone depletion; Smog; Air pollution; acid deposition; air issue; air pollution; air quality; airborne particulates; atmospheric pollution; climate change; integration need; ozone depletion; pollution policy; suspended particulate matter; Canada",,,,,,"Alcamo, J., Shaw, R., Hordijk, L., (1990) The RAINS Model of Acidification: Science and Strategies in Europe, 402p. , Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, Boston; Munn, R.E., Atmospheric Change in Canada: Assessing the whole as well as the parts (1995) Summary Report of a Workshop, 36p. , Institute for Environmental Studies, University of Toronto; Nilsson, L.-O., Forest biogeochemistry interactions among greenhouse gases and N deposition (1995) Water, Air, and Soil Pollut., 85, pp. 1557-1562; Penner, J.E., Connell, P.S., Wuebbles, D.J., Covey, C.C., (1988) Climate Change and Its Interactions with Air Chemistry: Perspectives and Research Needs, 90p. , Technical Information Department, University of California, Livermore; Rodhe, H., Grennfelt, P., Wisniewski, J., Agren, C., Bengtsson, G., Johansson, K., Kauppi, P., Sellden, G., Acid Reign ' 95?-Conference Summary Statement (1995) Water, Air, and Soil Pollut., 85, pp. 1-14; Samson, P., Augustine, S., Sillman, M., Linkages between global climate warming and ambient air quality (1989) Global Climate Change Linkages: Acid Rain, Air Quality and Stratospheric Ozone, pp. 79-93. , J.
