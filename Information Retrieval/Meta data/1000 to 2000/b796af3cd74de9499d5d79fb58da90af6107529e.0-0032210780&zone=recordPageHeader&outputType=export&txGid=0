By using three independent methods, the two-hourly observations have been sorted by air mass origins into those from 'unpolluted' or Northern Hemisphere baseline air masses and those from 'polluted' European air masses. Northern Hemisphere baseline methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide concentrations have risen throughout the 10 year period and their respective mid-1996 levels are the highest mid-year levels recorded so far. For ozone, the mid-1996 annual mean concentrations was within 0.1 ppb of the highest mid-year level. The elevated greenhouse gas concentrations found in 'polluted' air masses provide clear evidence for the presence of substantial emission sources in Europe. Using a simple climatological long-range transport model and a sophisticated Lagrangian dispersion model, it has been possible to estimate the magnitudes of the greenhouse gas emissions required to support the observations. Estimates of European source strengths of methane, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and halocarbons agree well with the available emission inventories. Using the Mace Head observations, significant additional contributions to global climate change have been identified from the trace gases: methane, nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone, over and above that driven by carbon dioxide. The radiative forcing consequences of a range of HCFCs and HFCs will only become of significance should their emissions grow to become comparable with those of the CFCs that they have replaced.","Carbon dioxide;
