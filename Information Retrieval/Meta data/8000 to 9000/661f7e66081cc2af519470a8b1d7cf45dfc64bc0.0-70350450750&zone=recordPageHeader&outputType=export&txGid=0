In fact, there hasrecently been growing attention in including environmental concerns at the strategic level of supply chainmanagement. In this part 2, the spatially explicit multi-echelon mixed integer linear program (MILP)modeling framework described in part 11 of this work has been extended by including environmental issuesalong with the traditional economic ones within a more comprehensive multi-objective optimization tool.The economics have been assessed by means of supply chain analysis techniques, focusing on biomasscultivation site locations, ethanol production capacity assignment and facilities location, as well astransport system optimization. The environmental performance of the system has been evaluated in termsof greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, by adopting a well-to-tank (WTT) approach to consider the supplynetwork operating impact on global warming over the entire life cycle. The strategic design tool asdeveloped has been applied and solved in assessing the emerging corn-based Italian ethanol system. Theresulting outcomes demonstrate the valuable support that the model may provide in formulating a welladvisedstrategic policy to promote the market penetration as well as to reduce the social and environmentalimpacts of biomass-based fuels.
