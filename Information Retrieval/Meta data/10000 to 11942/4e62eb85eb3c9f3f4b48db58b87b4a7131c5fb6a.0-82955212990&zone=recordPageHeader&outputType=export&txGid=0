Cultivation of rice is seriously affected by the HTD in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which directly affects food security in this region and in the whole of China. It is important to monitor and assess crop HTD using satellite remote sensing information. This paper reviews the recent development of monitoring rice HTD using optical remote sensing information. It includes the use of optical remote sensing information to obtain the regional spatial distribution of high temperatures, mixed-surface temperature retrieval for rice fields based on mixed decomposition information, the development of field and thermal infrared testing and modeling, and the satellite/ground-based remote sensing coupled method for monitoring rice HTD. Finally, the prospects for monitoring crop HTD based on remote sensing information are summarized. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","high-temperature damage; hyperspectral remote sensing; infrared remote sensing; rice; satellite and ground-based optical remote sensing","Coupled method; Food security; Ground based; High temperature; High-temperature damage; Hyperspectral remote sensing; infrared remote sensing; Optical remote sensing; Remote sensing information; rice; Rice fields; Satellite remote sensing; Temperature retrieval; Thermal infrared; Yangtze River; Crops; Food supply; Global warming; Information use; Satellites; Surface testing; Remote sensing; climate change; climate effect; crop production; cultivation; damage; global warming; ground-based measurement; high temperature; monitoring system; remote sensing; rice; satellite data; spatial distribution; spectral analysis; China; Yangtze River",,,,,,"(2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Summary for Policymakers Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Rosenzweig, C., Parry, M.L., Potential impact of climate-change on world food-supply (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 133-138; Nicholls, N., Increased Australian wheat yield due to recent climate trends (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 484-485; Gifford, R., Angus, J., Barrett, D., Climate change and Australian wheat yield (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 448-449; Lobell, D.B., Asner, G.P., Climate and management contributions to recent trends in US Agricultural Yield (2003) Science, 299, p. 1032; Tubiello, F.N., Soussana, J.F., Howden, S.M., Crop and pasture response to climate change (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 104, pp. 19686-19690; (1986) China Rice Cultivation (in Chinese), , Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing: China Agriculture Press; Chen, S.H., Li, J., (2007) Model Chinese Rice (in Chinese), , Beijing: Jindun Press; Yao, F.M., Zhang, J.H., (2008) Impact of Climate Change on Crop Yield and Its Simulation in China, , Beijing: Meteorological Press; Gao, L.Z., Li, L., (1992) Meteorological Ecology of Rice Crop (in Chinese), , Beijing: China Agriculture Press; Peng, S., Huang, J., John, E., Rice yield decline with higher night temperature from global warming (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 101, pp. 9971-9975; Zhao, H.Y., Yao, F.M., Zhang, Y., Correlation analysis of rice seed setting rate and weight of 1000-grain and agro-meteorology over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (2006) Sci Agri Sin, 39, pp. 1765-1771; Yao, F.M., Xu, Y.L., Lin, E.D., Assessing the impacts of climate change on rice yields in the main rice areas of China (2007) Clim Change, 80, pp. 395-409; Xie, X.J., Li, B.B., Shen, S.H., Influence of high temperature stress on some physiological characteristics of flag leaves of rice variety Yangdao 6 (in Chinese) (2009) Chin J Agrome, 30, pp. 84-87; Chen, L.X., Zhu, Q.G., Luo, H.B., (1991) East Asian Monsoon (in Chinese), pp. 162-192. , Beijing: Meteorological Press; Zhang, J.H., Fu, C.B., Yao, F.M., Study on respondence of ecosystem to East Asian Monsoon in Eastern China using remote sensing data derived from remote sensing (2004) Prog Nat Sci, 14, pp. 279-283; Yin, J., Zhang, C.J., Zhang, C.M., Climatic diagnostic analysis of the exceptional high temperature in summer 2003 in Jiangxi Province (in Chinese) (2005) J Nanjing Inst Meterol, 28, pp. 855-861; Yin, D.P., Yan, M.L., Pei, H.Y., Synoptic character analysis on high temperature appearing under the control of subtropical high (in Chinese) (2006) Sci Meteorol Sin, 26, pp. 559-563; Tian, X.H., Tsutomu, M., Li, S.H., High temperature stress on rice anthesis: Research progress and prospects (in Chinese) (2007) Chin J Appl Ecol, 18, pp. 2632-2636; Wang, J.L., Chen, X.B., Progresses in rice heat tolerance (in Chinese) (2006) Hunai Agric Sci, 6, pp. 23-26; Sun, J.L., (1996) Pandect on Dynamic Monitoring and Yield Estimation for Crop in China (in Chinese), , Beijing: Chinese Science and Technique Press; Wang, R.C., Huang, J.F., (1996) Crop Yield Estimation Remote Sensing (in Chinese), , Beijing: China Agriculture Press; Wang, J.H., Zhao, C.J., Huang, W.J., (2008) Basis and Application of Agriculture Quantitative Remote Sensing (in Chinese), , Beijing: Science Press; Price, J.C., Land surface temperature measurements from the split window channels of the NOAA 7 advanced very high resolution radiometer (1984) J Geophys Res, 89, pp. 7231-7237; Kerr, Y.H., Lagouarde, J.P., Imberon, J., Accurate land surface temperature retrieval from AVHRR data with use of an improved split window algorithm (1992) Remote Sens Environ, 41, pp. 197-209; Prata, A.J., Land surface temperature derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer and the along-track scanning radiometer 1 (1993) Theory.
