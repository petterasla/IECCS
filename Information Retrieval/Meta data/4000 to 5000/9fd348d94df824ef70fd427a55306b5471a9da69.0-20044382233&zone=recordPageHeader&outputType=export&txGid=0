We examined ∼1000-yr chronologies for five species of high-elevation conifers at 13 sites in western North America. Using non-parametric ordination and cluster analysis, we decomposed the variability at annual to decadal timescales into two dimensions, both of which are significantly correlated to temperature and precipitation variation. Tree-ring sites map onto the ordination axes according to species and relative position on the landscape. A spectral analysis of the ordination axes indicates a secular trend and significant quasi-periodic variation on scales of years to decades. Further, we find that the pattern of high-elevation conifer growth rates during the last half of the twentieth century are different than any time in the past 1000 years, indicating a distinct biological signature of global climate change. © 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.","Cluster analysis; Dendrochronology; Global warming; Late Holocene; Ordination; Paleoclimatology; Sierra Nevada","alpine environment; altitude; climate change; global warming; growth; tree; California; North America; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Western Hemisphere; White Mountains [California-Nevada]; World; Coniferophyta",,,,,,"Barber, V.A., Juday, G.P., Finney, B.P., Reduced growth of Alaskan white spruce in the twentieth century from temperature-induced drought stress (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 668-673; Biondi, F., Cayan, D.R., Gershunov, A., North pacific decadal climate variability since 1661 (2001) Bulletin of the American Meteorology Society, 14, pp. 5-9; Bradley, R.S., Jones, P.D., (1992) Climate since A.D. 1500, , London, New York: Routledge; Briffa, K.R., Increasing productivity of 'natural growth' conifers in Europe over the last century (1992) Tree Rings and Environment: Proceedings of the International Symposium, pp. 64-71. , Barthohin, T.S., Berglurd, B.E., Eckstein, D. and Schweingruder, F.H., editors, Sweden: Department of Quaternary Geology, Lund University, Lundqua Report 34; Briffa, K.R., Osborn, T.J., Seeing the wood from the trees (1999) Science, 284, pp. 926-927; Briffa, K.R., Jones, P.D., Bartholin, T.S., Eckstein, D., Schweingruber, F.H., Karlen, W., Zetteberg, P., Eronen, M., Fennoscandian summers from A.D. 500: Temperature changes on short and long time scales (1992) Climate Dynamics, 7, pp. 111-119; Bunn, A.G., Lawrence, R.L., Bellante, G.J., Waggoner, L.A., Graumlich, L.J., Spatial variation in distribution and growth patterns of old growth strip-bark pines (2003) Arctic, Antarctic and Alpine Research, 35, pp. 323-330; Cayan, D.R., Dettinger, M.D., Diaz, H.F., Graham, N.E., Decadal variability of precipitation over western North America (1998) Journal of Climate, 11, pp. 3148-3166; Clarke, K.R., Non-parametric multivariate analyses of changes in community structure (1993) Australian Journal of Ecology, 18, pp. 117-143; Crowley, T.J., Causes of climate change over the past 1,000 years (2000) Science, 289, pp. 270-277; Dettinger, M.D., Cayan, D.R., Diaz, H.F., Meko, D., North-south precipitation patterns in western North America on interannual-to-decadal timescales (1998) Journal of Climate, 11, pp. 3095-3111; Fritts, H.C., (1976) Tree Rings and Climate, , London, New York: Academic Press; Gabriel, K.R., The biplot graphical display of matrices with application to principal component analysis (1971) Biometrika, 58, pp. 446-453; Gedalof, Z., Smith, D.J., Low-frequency climate variability and regime-scale shifts in Pacific North America (2001) Geophysical Research Letters, 28, pp. 1515-1518; Graumlich, L.J., Subalpine tree growth, climate, and increasing CO2: An assessment of recent growth trends (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 1-11; A 1000-year record of temperature and precipitation in the Sierra Nevada (1993) Quaternary Research, 39, pp. 249-255; Graybill, D.A., (1987) Cirque Peak Tree-ring Chronology.
