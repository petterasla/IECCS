This legislation, culminating with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, has been instrumental in defining methods for identifying and protecting endangered or threatened species and their habitats. Current legislation, however, assumes that the range of a protected species will stay constant over time. This assumption may no longer be valid, as the unprecedented increase in the number and concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has the potential to cause a global warming of 1.0-4.5°C and a sea-level rise (SLR) of 31-150 cm by the year 2100. Changes in climate of this magnitude are capable of causing shifts in the population structure and range of most animal species. This article examines the effects that SLR may have on the habitats of endangered and threatened species at three scales. At the regional scale 52 endangered or threatened plant and animal species were found to reside within 3 m of mean sea level in the coastal stages of the US Southeast. At the state level, the habitats of nine endangered or threatened animals that may be at risk from future SLR were identified. At the local level, a microscale analysis was conducted in the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina, USA, on the adverse effects that SLR may have on the habitats of the American alligator, brown pelican, loggerhead sea turtle, and wood stork. © 1993 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Endangered species; Greenhouse effect; Habitat loss; Sea-level rise; South Carolina; Threatened species","American alligator; brown pelican; endangered species; loggerhead; sea level rise; wood stork; USA, South Carolina, Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge; Alligator mississippiensis; Caretta caretta; Mycteria americana; Pelecanus occidentalis; sea water; alligator; aquatic fauna; article; bird; climate; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; human; law; population structure; species; turtle; united states; wildlife",,,,,,"Behler, J.L., King, F.W., (1979) The Audubon Society field guide to North American reptiles and amphibians, , National Audubon Society, Alfred A.
