The history of human development rests on the availability and use of energy, the transformation from the early use of fire and animal power that improved lives, to the present world with use of electricity and clean fuels for a multitude of purposes. Energy is the neglected issue of the development debate. The lack of access to reliable and clean energy supplies is a major barrier to improving human well-being around the globe. There are an estimated 1.6 billion people living in the rural areas of developing countries who lack access to electricity, and so dependence on fossil fuels. Combustion of fossil fuels produces large amounts of CO2, an important greenhouse gas. In response to increasing concern about the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases on global climate, international action has been agreed to reduce these emissions. On the other hand, renewable energy is the great, barely tapped solution to the two great challenges of the coming century such as poverty and global warming. Not only can renewable energy provide a clean, flexible power source for homes, schools and hospitals, at the micro-to-medium scale it has huge potential to create meaningful and useful jobs.","Energy; Environmental issues; Renewables; Sustainable development","Developing countries; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Parameter estimation; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Emission reduction; Environmental issues; Flexible power sources; Energy policy",,,,,,"Boyle, G., (1996) Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future, , Oxford: The Open University; Ezzati, M., Indoor Air Quality in Developing Nations (2004) Encyclopedia of Energy, 3, pp. 343-350. , New York: Elsevier; (2000) Rome: The Energy and Agriculture Nexus, , Food and Agriculture Organization; Fay, J.A., Golomb, D.S., (2002) Energy and the Environment, , Oxford University Press; Gunerhan, H., Agi, S., Energy-environment-city triangle (2004) Energy Sources, 26, pp. 697-706; Kaygusuz, K., Renewable energy sources: The key to a better future (2002) Energy Sources, 24, pp. 787-799; (2002) Beyond Kyoto: Energy Dynamics and Climate Stabilization, , OECD/IEA, Paris: OECD/IEA; (2002) World Energy Outlook, , OECD/IEA, Paris: OECD/IEA; OECD/IEA. 2002c.
