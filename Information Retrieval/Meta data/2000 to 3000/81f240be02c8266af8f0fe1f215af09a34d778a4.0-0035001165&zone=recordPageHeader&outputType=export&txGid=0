Selling emission reduction units before a market has actually developed presents pricing problems for both sellers and buyers. In the case of sequestered carbon and in the example of a Costa Rican project, it may be economically beneficial to both buyer and seller alike for the buyer to purchase the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a carbon tradable offset (CTO). It is shown by valuing purchases and sales of CTO options that advantages from such an instrument are possible to both seller and buyer at least until a true market in GHG offset trading develops. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Carbon tradable offsets; Climate change; Emission reduction unit; Global warming; Greenhouse gas offsets; Kyoto Protocol","carbon emission; cleaner production; economic instrument; emissions trading; environmental economics; Kyoto Protocol; Costa Rica",,,,,,"Arts, K., Peters, P., Schrijver, N., Van Sluijs, P., Legal and institutional aspects (1994) Joint Implementation to Curb Climate Change: Legal and Economic Aspects, , O.
