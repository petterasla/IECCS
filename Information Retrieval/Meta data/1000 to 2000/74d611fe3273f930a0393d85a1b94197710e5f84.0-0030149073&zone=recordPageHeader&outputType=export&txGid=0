Insurance companies, and increasingly banks and pension funds, have come to fear that a warming world holds the danger of unmanageable property-catastrophe losses triggered by an increase in extreme climate-related events, plus a spectrum of major knock-on problems for debt and equity investments. This emerging greenhouse market-driver now has major implications for corporate strategy in both the financial and energy sectors.","Banking; Climate change; Insurance; Solar energy","Banking; Energy sector; Economic and social effects; Finance; Greenhouse effect; Insurance; Marketing; Social aspects; Solar energy; Global warming",,,,,,"Leggett, J.K., (1996) Climate Change and the Financial Institutions: The Emerging Threat, the Solar Solution, , Gerling Akademie Verlag, Munich. 212pp",,,,,,,,,09601481,,,,"English","Renew.
