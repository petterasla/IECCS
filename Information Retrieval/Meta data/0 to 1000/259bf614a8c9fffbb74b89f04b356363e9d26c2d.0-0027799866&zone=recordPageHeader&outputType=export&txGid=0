The measurements were made at three temperatures (287 K, 270 K and 253 K) with a Fourier transform spectrometer operating at 0.03 cm-1 apodized resolution. Integrated cross sections have been introduced into a two-dimensional radiative-chemical-dynamical model in order to calculate the global warming potential (GWP) of each gas. -Authors",,"dynamic model; Fourier transform spectrometer; global warming; hydrohalocarbon; infrared cross section",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027799866
