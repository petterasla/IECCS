Box 339, Bloemfontein 9300, South Africa","Palynological and sedimentological data from a core extracted from Lake Eteza shed new light on the Holocene vegetation and climate history in KwaZulu-Natal and can be linked to regional and global climate change. A 2072. cm core with nineteen radiocarbon dates and chronological extrapolation to the bottom of the sequence suggests that sedimentation started ca. 10. 200. cal. yrs. BP. Between ca. 10. 200 and 6800. cal. yrs. BP pollen indicators point to a change from intermediately humid conditions to comparatively drier grassy environments. This is in good agreement with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fluctuations from a core in the Mozambique Channel which influence precipitation in coastal KwaZulu-Natal, and the beginning of the Holocene Thermal Maximum ca. 10. 500. cal. yrs. BP. The lower section of the core corresponds to gradually increasing Holocene sea levels along the coast and development of freshwater or estuarine conditions at Lake Eteza. The middle Holocene (ca. 6800-3600. cal. yrs. BP), when the sea level reached its highest stand and SST peak, indicate humid climatic conditions that favoured an increase of forest trees, e.g. Podocarpus, and undergrowth plants like Issoglossa. As a consequence of higher precipitation and increase of the water table, conditions were favourable for the spread of mangrove, swamp and possibly riverine forest. During the late Holocene after ca. 3600. cal. yrs. BP a decrease of Podocarpus and other trees as well as an increase of Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, grasses and Phoenix coincide with a return to lower sea levels and drier conditions. The decrease of all trees including Phoenix at ca. 700. cal. yrs. BP, accompanied by rapid sedimentation rates, possibly reflect forest clearing and upland erosion induced by activities of Iron Age settlers. A dry period at the globally recognized onset of the Little Ice Age might have contributed to these changes. Late Iron Age settlers have probably already introduced Zea mays, which was detected in the profile since ca. 210. BP. The appearance of neophytes like Pinus, Casuarina and pollen of Ambrosia-type in the youngest sediments indicates increased disturbance of European settlements and land use since ca. 100. cal. yrs. BP. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","African coast; Forest reconstruction; Human impact; Southern Hemisphere; Vegetation history","chronology; climate change; coastal zone; coniferous tree; core analysis; estuarine ecosystem; global climate; grass; human activity; human settlement; humid environment; Hypsithermal; Iron Age; land use; Little Ice Age; maize; paleoclimate; paleoecology; palynology; radiocarbon dating; sea surface temperature; sedimentation rate; sedimentology; shrub; vegetation dynamics; vegetation history; water table; Indian Ocean; KwaZulu-Natal; Lake Eteza; Mozambique Channel; South Africa; Ambrosia; Casuarina; Poaceae; Podocarpus; Zea mays",,,,,,"Abbot, R.T., Spread of Melanoides tuberculata (1973) The Nautilus, 87 (1), p. 29; Allanson, B.R., Baird, D., (1999) Estuaries of South Africa, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bard, E., Rostek, F., Sonzogni, C., Interhemispheric synchrony of the last deglaciation inferred from alkenone palaeothermometry (1997) Nature, 385, pp. 707-710; Barron, J.A., Diatoms (1993) Fossil Prokaryotes and Protists, pp. 155-167. , Blackwell Sciences, J.H.
