Appropriate treatments to decompose halon waste is important to protect the environment. A dry process to decompose halon has been developed. Solid alkaline carbonate and hydrate obtained from dolomite were prepared for the reactants to decompose halon and to react with the fluorine and bromine produced by the halon decomposition. Twelve kinds of reactants were obtained by changing the burning temperature and burning time. The amount of the decomposed halon and the conversion were correlated with the pore distributions in the reactants. The distributions of F and Br differed depending on the preparation of the reactants. The difference would be attributed to the reactivity and the diffusion rate of the gases produced by the decomposing halon.","Decomposition; Dolomite; Halon; Pore distribution; Pore volume","Solid reactant condition; Adsorption; Carbon; Decomposition; Diffusion; Global warming; Ozone; Thermal effects; Chemical engineering; waste disposal",,,,,,"Babushok, V., Noto, T., Burgess, D.R.F., Hamins, A., Tsang, W., Influence of CF 3I, CF 3Br, and CF 3H on the high-temperature combustion of methane (1996) Combustion and Flame, 107, pp. 351-367; Battin-Leclerc, F., Come, G.M., Baronnet, F., The inhibiting effect of CF 3Br on the reaction CH 4 + O 2 at 1070 K (1994) Combustion and Flame, 99, pp. 644-652; Kennedy, E.M., Li, K., Moghtaderi, B., Dlugogorski, B.Z., A process for disposal of halon 1301 (CF 3Br) (1999) Chem.
