It is the least populating fuel available, and can be produced anywhere there is water and a clean source of electricity. A fuel cycle in which hydrogen is produced by solar-electrolysis of water, or by gasification of renewably grown biomass, and then used in a fuel-cell powered electric-motor vehicle (FCEV), would produce little or no local, regional or global pollution. Hydrogen FCEVs would combine the best features of battery-powered electric vehicles (BPEVS)-zero emissions, high efficiency, quiet operation and long life-with the long range and fast refueling time of internal-combustion-engine vehicles (ICEVs). If fuel-cell technology develops as hoped, then hydrogen FCEVs will be a significant advance over both hydrogen ICEVs and solar BPEVs: they will be cleaner and more efficient than hydrogen ICEVs, have a much shorter refueling time than BPEVs and have a lower life-cycle cost than both. Solar-hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles would be general-purpose zero-emission vehicles, and could be an important component of a strategy for reducing dependence on imported oil, mitigating global warming and improving urban air quality, at an acceptable cost. © 1993.",,,,,,,,"Adcock, Bargon, Dudfield, Mitchell, Naylor, Newbold, Prospects for the application of fuel cells in electric vehicles (1992) Journal of Power Sources, 37, pp. 201-207; (1990) Alternative Energy Sources for Road Transport, Hydrogen Drive Test, , Verlag TUV Rheinland, for the Federal Ministry of Transport, Koln, Germany; Amphlett, Mann, Peppley, Stokes, Some design considerations for a catalytic methanol steam reformer (1991) Proceedings of the 26th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference, 3, pp. 642-649. , American Nuclear Society, La Grange, Illinois, August 4–9, Boston, Massachusetts; Appleby, Grove anniversary fuel cell symposium-closing remarks (1990) Journal of Power Sources, 29, pp. 267-276; Appleby, Fuel cell technology and innovation (1992) Journal of Power Sources, 37, pp. 223-239; Appleyard, Electric vehicle drive systems (1992) Journal of Power Sources, 37, pp. 189-200; Ballard Powers Systems, (1990) The Ballard fuel cell, , North Vancouver, BC; Bockris, (1980) Energy Options, , Halsted Press, New York; Braess, Regar, Electrically propelled vehicles at BMW-experience to date and development trends (1991) SAE Technical Paper Series. #910245, , Society of Automotive Engineers, Warrendale, PA; Brewer, Hydrogen-fueled aircraft-1983 update (1986) Recent Developments in Hydrogen Technology, 1, pp. 55-152. , K.D.
