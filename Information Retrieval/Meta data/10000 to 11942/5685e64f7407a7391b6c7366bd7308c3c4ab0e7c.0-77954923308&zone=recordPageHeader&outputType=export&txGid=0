Arrhenius parameters and equations were used to calculate relative incinerability of three bromofluorocarbons (halon 1301, halon 1211, and halon 2402) and two hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC-22 and HCFC-123) that are not in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Thermal Stability-Based Ranking of Hazardous Waste Incinerability. Halons and HCFCs evaluated in this report have Incinerability Indices that rank below Class I. Thus, they may be disposed of in incinerators that have proven destruction and removal efficiency >99.99% for at least one Class I principal organic hazardous constituent. A discussion of thermal destruction mechanisms of these compounds is given. Thermal destruction may result in products of incomplete combustion that exhibit ozone-depleting or global-warming potential. Additional theoretical and possibly experimental evaluations will be required to address these issues. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2010.","chemical kinetics and equilibria; climate change; Halons; hazardous materials; hydrochlorofluorocarbons; incinerability; ozonedepleting substance; thermal treatment","Arrhenius parameters; Chemical kinetics; chemical kinetics and equilibria; Class I; Destruction and removal efficiency; Experimental evaluation; Global warming potential; Halogenated organic compounds; Halon 1211; Halon 1301; Hazardous wastes; Hydrochlorofluorocarbons; Incomplete combustion; Theoretical calculations; Theoretical estimation; Thermal destruction; Thermal stability; Thermal treatment; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental Protection Agency; Halon; Hazardous materials; Heat treatment; Ozone; Removal; Waste incineration; Climate change; 1,1,1 trichloroethane; 1,2 dichlorobenzene; 1,2,4,5 tetrachlorobenzene; bromochlorodifluoromethane; bromotrifluoromethane; carbon tetrachloride; chlorobenzene; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; dichlorodifluoromethane; halon 2402; hydrochlorofluorocarbon 123; hydrochlorofluorocarbon 22; methyl bromide; tetrachloroethylene; trichlorobenzene; unclassified drug; article; chemical reaction kinetics; climate change; combustion; degradation kinetics; environmental protection; foam; greenhouse effect; hazardous waste; high temperature procedures; incineration; municipal solid waste; oxidation; ozone depletion; process monitoring; solid waste management; system analysis; theoretical model; theoretical study; thermostability; waste component removal",,"1,1,1 trichloroethane, 71-55-6; 1,2 dichlorobenzene, 95-50-1; carbon tetrachloride, 56-23-5; chlorobenzene, 108-90-7; dichlorodifluoromethane, 75-71-8; methyl bromide, 74-83-9; tetrachloroethylene, 127-18-4; trichlorobenzene, 12002-48-1",,,,"Dellinger, B., Lamb, C.W., (2002) Theoretical DRE Calculations for Incinerators and Thermal Oxidizers, , IT3 Conference, May, 13-17.
