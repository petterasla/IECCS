The dinumal CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from sheep were continuously recorded using the flow-through chamber method. A type new type of non-disperse infrared (NDIR) gas sensors based on pulse IR source was introduced, and by using the high performance pyroelectric IR sensor with built in interference filter and the ""single light and two wavelengths"" technology, CH4 and CO2 measurement from ruminants was achieved. Animals were given dry oat hay as the basic diet and supplemented concentrate with the ratio of 7:3. The results showed that the recovery was 96.7% and 96.2% for CH4 and CO2, respectively. Methane and carbon dioxide output from sheep respectively averaged 15.6 g per day and 184.7 g per day, equivalent to 6.8 and 71.1kg per animal. Diurnal fluctuations in hourly rates of CH4 and CO2 production in hourly of methane increased during day light to reach a peak at or near sunset and then declined towards sunrise, and consideration was given to the dry matter intake of the animals used in these studies and its possible effects on CH4 production.","Carbon dioxide; Methane; NDIR gas analyser; Ruminant","Carbon dioxide emissions; Diurnal fluctuations; Dry matters; Flowthrough; Gas sensors; Interference filters; IR sensor; IR source; Loss of energy; NDIR gas analyser; Two wavelength; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Mammals; Sensors; Wool; Methane; carbon dioxide; methane; animal; diet; diet supplementation; greenhouse effect; infrared spectrophotometry; periodicity; sheep; veterinary; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Periodicity; Sheep; Spectrophotometry, Infrared",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; Carbon Dioxide; Methane",,,,"Cicerone, R.J., Oremland, R.S., (1988) Global Biochem., 2, p. 299; Christiansen, T.R., Cox, P., (1995) Tellus, Ser.
