The environmental impact of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) plant is very much less than that of a coal-fired plant (a factor of 1 300 for air pollution and a factor of 1 5 for water pollution). Compared with a conventional gas plant, impact is reduced by between 50 and 98%. Damage to cultural monuments and buildings is negligible from a fuel cell plant. Socioeconomic negative impacts are reduced by about 30% relative to conventional gas plants (aesthetics and noise) whereas employment is unaltered. Impact on health and safety is greatly reduced compared with that from coal-fired plants and is about 70% of that from conventional gas plants. Preliminary results suggest that society's willingness to pay (WTP) for clean air, and thereby better health, matches the cost of installing emission-reducing equipment on conventional power plants. There is probably an additional WTP for other benefits (e.g., decreased risk of global warming). Thus, the utility of very small emissions, lower CO2 discharges, and other benefits from SOFC generators may compensate for the increased cost incurred in producing electricity by SOFC generators. © 1991.",,"Electric Power Plants; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Emission-reducing equipment; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Fuel Cells",,,,,,"Abrahamsen, Effects of long range transported air pollutants on forest.
