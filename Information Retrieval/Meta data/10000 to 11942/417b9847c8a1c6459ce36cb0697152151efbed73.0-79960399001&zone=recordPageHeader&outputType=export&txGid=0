Following the rule that only measurable is manageable, mensuration of greenhouse gas intensiveness of different products, bodies, and processes is going on worldwide, expressed as their carbon footprints. The methodologies for carbon footprint calculations are still evolving and it is emerging as an important tool for greenhouse gas management. The concept of carbon footprinting has permeated and is being commercialized in all the areas of life and economy, but there is little coherence in definitions and calculations of carbon footprints among the studies. There are disagreements in the selection of gases, and the order of emissions to be covered in footprint calculations. Standards of greenhouse gas accounting are the common resources used in footprint calculations, although there is no mandatory provision of footprint verification. Carbon footprinting is intended to be a tool to guide the relevant emission cuts and verifications, its standardization at international level are therefore necessary. Present review describes the prevailing carbon footprinting methods and raises the related issues. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon footprint; Direct emissions; Embodied emissions; Greenhouse gases","Carbon footprint; Common resources; Direct emissions; Embodied emissions; Footprinting; Greenhouse gas management; Greenhouse gases; Global warming; carbon emission; concentration (composition); estimation method; greenhouse gas; air pollution indicator; article; carbon footprint; energy consumption; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Environmental Monitoring; Statistics as Topic",,"Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"(2009) An Inconvenient Truth, Carbon Calculator, , http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/carboncalculator/, Accessed 11 Sept 2009; Bellassen, V., Leguet, G., The emergence of voluntary carbon offsetting (2007) Mission Climate Research Report No. 11, , Caisse des depots Paris; Berg, W., Brunsch, R., Hellebrand, H.J., Kern, J., Methodology for measuring gaseous emissions from agricultural buildings, manure, and soil surfaces (2006) Workshop on Agricultural Air Quality, , 5-8 June 2006, Washington, DC; Bokowski, G., White, D., Pacifico, A., Talbot, S., Dubelko, A., Phipps, A., (2007) Towards Campus Climate Neutrality: Simon Fraser University's Carbon Footprint, , Simon Fraser University; (2007) What Is A Carbon Footprint?, , http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/ downloads/A/ABP_ADV_what_on_earth_is_a_carbon_footprint.pdf, BP Accessedon 7 Aug 2007; Brewer, R.S., (2008) Literature Review on Carbon Footprint Collection and Analysis, , http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/09-05/09-05.pdf, Accessed on 29 January 2009; Brewer, R.S., Carbon metric collection and analysis with the personal environmental tracker (2008) Workshops Proceedings.
