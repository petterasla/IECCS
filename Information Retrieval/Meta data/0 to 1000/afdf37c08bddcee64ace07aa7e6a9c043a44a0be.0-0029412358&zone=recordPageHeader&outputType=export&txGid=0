The paper describes the analysis of the drainage systems of three catchment areas, each with different surface characteristics, within the Borough of Gosport. The performance of each system is examined under a combination of three possible sea-level rise scenarios and two possible storm conditions. The results give cause for concern and have to be taken seriously; it is proposed that effects of rising sea levels, due to global warming, should be taken into account in current design work. It is proposed that a new assessment procedure ""climatic impact assessment' becomes a compulsory requirement for all schemes that might be sensitive to the effects of climate change. -from Authors",,"climate change; climate impact assessment; climatic change; coastal development; design need; drainage; drainage system; engineering; forward planning; planning; sea level rise; sea-level rise; water management; UK, England, Hampshire, Gosport; Climate change; Drainage; Environmental impact; Global warming; Performance; Sea level; Societies and institutions; Storms; Climatic impact assessment; Sea level rise; Civil engineering; Change; Climate; Drainage; Global Warming; Sea Level Changes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029412358
