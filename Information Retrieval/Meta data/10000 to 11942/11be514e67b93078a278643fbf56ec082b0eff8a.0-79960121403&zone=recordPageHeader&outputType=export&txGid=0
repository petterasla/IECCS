This paper discusses this development in the PPI and offers some illustrative examples to demonstrate the vital need for opening up new strategic options. To address these challenges, we launch a dynamic strategic framework for a PPI firm. This dynamic capabilities- and strategic options-based framework comprises of (i) sensing the weak signals of the operational environment, (ii) formulating them as strategic options in order to capture their upside potential, (iii) hedging against the downside risks of the options, (iv) exercising these options in often thin (i.e., imperfect) intangible knowledge assets markets, and (v) reconfiguring the existing knowledge base and capabilities to sustain competitive advantage obtained. The framework will be illustrated with strategic options possible for the PPI the main focus being on the interface between the PPI and energy industry by means of a forest biorefinery case. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic capabilities; Forest biorefinery; Pulp and paper industry; Scale economies; Scope economies; Strategic options","Dynamic capabilities; Forest biorefinery; Pulp and paper industry; Scale economies; Scope economies; Strategic options; Climate change; Competition; Industrial management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Pulp; Refining; Paper and pulp industry; Economic Analysis; Forests; Industrial Engineering; Paper Industry; Pulp Industry; Refiners; Seasonal Variation",,,,,,"Ambrosini, V., Bowman, C., What are dynamic capabilities and are they a useful construct in strategic management?
