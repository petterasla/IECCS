Calculations of CO2 consumption by silicate weathering show that CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere of ca. 1018/Myr could account for inferred Paleocene/Eocene atmospheric CO2 contents, and the resulting greenhouse effect would have contributed to Eocene warmth. Extensive portions of the Tethyan orogen underwent regional metamorphism culminating in the Eocene. Prograde metamorphism may have been contemporaneous with the Late Paleocene global warming. We calculated the amount of metamorphic CO2 produced at depth in the Himalayan orogen with data on the timing of the India/Asia collison, duration of prograde regional metamorphism, and proportions and bulk compositions of metamorphic CO2 source rocks. If CO2 was generated at a constant rate over a 10 Myr period of prograde metamorphism in the Himalayan orogen, we estimate that ca. 1018-1019 moles/Myr of metamorphic CO2 were produced at depth. Significant expulsion of metamorphic CO2 to the atmosphere may have occurred by focused fluid flow along shear zones such as the extensive Main Central Thrust in the Himalayan orogen. An additional ca. 1018/Myr could have been contributed by Eocene regional metamorphism in the Mediterranean Tethys (i.e., from the Alps to Turkey). The extensive metamorphism associated with the India/Asia collision, and the closing of Tethys, may have contributed to CO2-greenhouse warming in the early to mid Cenozoic. © 1993.",,"carbon dioxide; metamorphism; orogenesis; palaeoclimate; Tertiary",,,,,,"Absar, Prakash, Aggarwal, A preliminary conceptual model of Nubra Valley geothermal system, Ladakh, J and K, India (1991) J.
