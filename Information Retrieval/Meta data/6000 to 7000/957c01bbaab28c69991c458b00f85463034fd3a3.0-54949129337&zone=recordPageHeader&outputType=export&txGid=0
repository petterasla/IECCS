Emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, from energy use in Asian countries now exceed those from the European Union or North America. Three of the top five emitters - China, India, and Japan, are Asian countries. Any meaningful global effort to address global climate change requires the active cooperation of these and other large Asian countries, if it is to succeed. Issues of equity between countries, within countries, and between generations, need to be tackled. Some quantitative current and historic data to illustrate the difficulties involved are provided, and one approach to making progress is suggested. © 2008 New York Academy of Sciences.","Asia; China; Climate change; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; India; Japan","carbon dioxide; Asia; China; climate change; conference paper; developing country; global climate; greenhouse gas; India; industrialization; Japan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Effect; Humans",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"(2006) Kyoto Protocol Status of Ratification, Updated 10 July 2006., , United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
