The use of stabilization technology relating to bulk waste materials, coal ash, oil ash and incinerator ash is discussed. The extension of this technology to inert minestone waste and tailings, contaminated dredged sediments and phosphogypsum is explored. Uses of stabilized wastes are considered in the areas of habitat restoration, coastal defense and fishery enhancement. It is suggested that rehabilitation of marine dump sites receiving loose waste such as pulverized fuel ash (PFA) could be enhanced by the continued dumping of the material but in a stabilized block form, so creating new habitat diversity. The emphasis of coastal defenses is changing from ""hard' seawalls to ""soft' options which include offshore barriers to reduce wave energy reaching the coast. Stabilized waste materials could be included in these and other marine constructions with possible economic benefit. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), policy regarding marine structures and fishery enhancement is outlined. A case is made for the inclusion of fishery enhancement features in future coastal structures. -from Authors",,"coastal conservation; coastal fisheries; fishery enhancement; habitat enhancement; policy approach; reef development; sea dumping; waste disposal; UK; Coasts; Structures; Waste Disposal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00074977,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028665980
