Shallow autocompaction is an important component of elevation change that acts to decrease relative elevation. Unlike vertical accretion, which can be determined from repeated surveys of artificial marker horizons, autocompaction is difficult to measure. This report presents the results of a preliminary study that uses cesium-137 dating and down-core measurements of sediment bulk density to numerically model vertical accretion, shallow autocompaction and surface elevation change. The models produce vertical accretion rates that are comparable to rates derived from artificial marker horizons, and long-term surface elevation changes that are in close agreement with sedimentation rates based on cesium-137 dating of well-compacted sediment. The model results suggest that average annual vertical accretion may be higher than average annual surface elevation change by a factor of 1.6 to 21. Sedimentation rates derived from cesium-137 dating also are higher than average annual surface elevation change by a factor of 1.1 to 4.7. These findings suggest that sedimentation rates based on cesium-137 dating will tend to be lower than vertical accretion and higher than long-term surface elevation change. The results of the study re-emphasize the importance of fully accounting for shallow autocompaction when attempting to predict marsh surface elevation change.","Bulk density; Coastal marsh; Sea-level rise; Sedimentation rate; Vertical accretion","accretion; bulk density; cesium isotope; compaction; modeling; saltmarsh; sedimentation rate",,,,,,"Allen, J.R.L., Salt-marsh growth and stratification: A numerical model with special reference to the Severn Estuary, southwest Britain (1990) Marine Geology, 95, pp. 77-96; Allen, J.R.L., Geological Impacts on Coastal Wetland Landscapes: Some general effects of Sediment Autocompaction in the Holocene of Northwest Europe (1999) The Holocene, 9 (1), pp. 1-12; Baumann, R.H., Day, J.W., Miller, C.A., Mississippi deltaic wetland survival: Sedimentation versus coastal submergence (1984) Science, 224, pp. 1093-1094; Blais, J.M., Kalff, J., Cornett, R.J., Evans, R.D., Evaluation of 210Pb dating in lake sediments using stable Pb, Ambrosia pollen, and 137Cs (1995) Journal of Paleolimnology, 13 (2), pp. 169-178; Cahoon, D.R., Reed, D.J., Day J.W., Jr., Estimating shallow subsidence in microtidal salt marshes of the southeastern United States: Kaye and Barghoorn revisited (1995) Marine Geology, 128, pp. 1-10; Childers, D.L., Day J.W., Jr., Marsh-water column interactions in two Louisiana estuaries.
