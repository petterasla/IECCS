Simultaneous inversion of the data, as well as averaging of the individual site reconstructions, indicate that this high magnitude of GST warming exceeds over two times that of globally averaged GST's [Science 282 (1998) 279] and is significantly higher than that of surface temperature histories based on instrumental records and tree ring reconstruction in northern and western Canada [Holocene 7 (1997) 375; Science 278 (1997) 1251; Clim.
