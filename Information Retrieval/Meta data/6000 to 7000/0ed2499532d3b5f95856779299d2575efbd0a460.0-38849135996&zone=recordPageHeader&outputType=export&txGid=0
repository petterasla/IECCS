The appearance of the water is, however, influenced by a number of physical and biological factors such as the frequency of storms, the hydrological balance, the water level and the growth of algae. Here we report the results of a survey designed to test the reaction of the local population to these seasonal and inter-annual variations. This survey was based on a questionnaire completed by 960 permanent inhabitants of the shoreline villages and was designed to explore their awareness of the local and regional factors responsible for the changes. About one-quarter of the respondents considered that the drying effects of global climate change had already had an effect on the Lake Balaton area. Although younger (16-26) and middle-aged (27-50) respondents benefit most from good water quality, those in the oldest age group (51-92) were more concerned about the quality of the water and broader issues such as biodiversity and the conservation of the landscape. Considering that the future of the lake depends on the youngest generation, this suggests that their environmental education could be improved to strengthen their understanding of environmental issues. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Lake; Local inhabitants; Questionnaire; Sociological survey; Water quality","Climate change; Environmental impact; Hydrology; Social aspects; Storms; Surveying; Local inhabitants; Sociological survey; Lakes; alga; climate change; environmental education; global climate; growth rate; lacustrine environment; questionnaire survey; water level; water quality; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Hungary; Lake Balaton; algae",,,,,,"Alkan Olsson, J., Berg, K., Local stakeholders' acceptance of model-generated data used as a communication tool in water management (2005) Ambio, 34, pp. 507-512; Babbie, E., (2001) The Practice of Social Research, , Wadsworth/Thomson Learning Wadsworth; Bertram, P.E., Reynoldson, T.B., Developing ecosystem objectives for the Great Lakes: Policy, progress and public participation (2004) Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Stress and Recovery, 1, pp. 89-95; Hajnal, É., Padisák, J., Analysis of long-term ecological status of Lake Balaton based on the ALMOBAL phytoplankton database (2008) Hydrobiologia, , doi: 10.1007/s10750-007-9207-x; Hostmann, M., Borsuk, M., Reichert, P., Truffer, B., Stakeholder values in decision support for river rehabilitation (2005) Archiv für Hydrobiologie, Supplement, 155, pp. 491-505. , Large Rivers 15; Jöborn, A., Danielsson, I., Arheimer, B., Jonsson, A., Larsson, M.H., Lundquist, L.J., Löwgren, M., Tonderski, K., Integrated eater management for eutrophication control: Public participation, pricing policy, and catchment modelling (2005) Ambio, 34, pp. 482-488; Jonsson, A., Public participation in water resources management: Stakeholder voices on degree, scale and methods in future water management (2005) Ambio, 34, pp. 495-500; Löwgren, M., The water framework directive: Stakeholder preferences and catchment management strategies - Are they reconcilable?
