Nitrogen is considered to be an effective up-regulatory nutrient for crops grown under stress and non-stress conditions. In this study, we try to evaluate N fertiliser effects on contents of carbohydrate and N dynamics, dry matter accumulation in shoot, yield under post-anthesis waterlogging. Waterlogging after anthesis significantly reduced grain yield due to decrease in thousand-kernel-weight and in grain number per spike. High N fertiliser application aggravated grain yield loss due to post-anthesis waterlogging. These yield losses were related to the decreases in dry matter accumulation, redistribution of stored photosynthate to the grain, and the conversion capacity from carbohydrate to starch in grain. The decrease in dry matter accumulation could be attributed to the reduced activities of Pn (photosynthesis) and SPS (sucrose phosphate synthase) in the flag leaf, while the low capacity in starch synthesis could be explained by the reduced activities of sucrose synthase (SS) and soluble starch synthase (SSS) in grain. Total N uptake in shoot was also reduced, which could contribute to the losses in biomass and yield by waterlogging. The decrease in Pn was inconsistent with the increase in N content in the flag leaf at high N fertiliser application under post-anthesis waterlogging. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Dry matter distribution; Enzyme activity; Photosynthesis; Sink-source relationship; Starch; Winter wheat","carbohydrate; crop production; crop yield; enzyme activity; fertilizer application; nitrogen; nutrient dynamics; photosynthesis; starch; waterlogging; wheat; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Ahmed, S., Nawata, E., Sakuratani, T., Changes of endogenous ABA and ACC, and their correlations to photosynthesis and water relations in mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.)
