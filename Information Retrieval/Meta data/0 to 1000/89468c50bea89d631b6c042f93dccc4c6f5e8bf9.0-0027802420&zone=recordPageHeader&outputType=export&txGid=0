Significant lithologic and biotic changes occur in these strata near the top of the Paleocene. Global warming, increased precipitation, and other oceanographic and climatic events that have been recognized in high-latitude, deep-oceanic deposits of the latest Paleocene also influenced mid-latitude, shallow-marine, and terrestrial environments of the western North Atlantic. The diverse well-preserved calcareous nannofossil flora that is present throughout the entire New Jersey boundary section accurately places these events within the uppermost part of the upper Paleocene Zone NP 9. -from Authors",,"neritic sediment; palaeoceanography; Palaeocene; palaeoclimate; USA, New Jersey, Coastal Plain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08838305,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027802420
