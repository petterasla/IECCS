Despite increasing attention on global climate change, few studies have assessed the projected impacts of sea-level rise to threatened and endangered species. Therefore, we estimated the impacts of rising sea levels on the endangered Lower Keys marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris hefneri) across its geographic distribution under scenarios of current conditions, low (0.3-m), medium (0.6-m), and high (0.9-m) sea-level rise. We also investigated the impacts of allowing vegetation to migrate upslope and not allowing migration and of two land-use planning decisions (protection and abandonment of human-dominated areas). Not surprisingly, under all simulations we found a general trend of decreasing total potential LKMR habitat with increasing sea-level rise. Not allowing migration and protecting human-dominated areas both tended to decrease potential LKMR habitat compared with allowing migration and abandoning human-dominated areas. In conclusion, conservation strategies at multiple scales need to be implemented in order to reduce the impact of global climate change on biodiversity and endangered species. At the regional level, managers must consider land-use planning needs that take into account the needs of both humans and biodiversity. Finally, at the local scale those agencies that are in charge of endangered species conservation and ecosystem management need to rethink static approaches to conservation or else stand by and watch ecosystems degrade and species go extinct. This can be accomplished by bioclimatic reserve systems where climatically underrepresented areas are included in conservation planning along with the standard concerns of threat, opportunity, connectivity, and viability. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Climate change; Lagomorph; Land use planning; Lower Keys marsh rabbit; Sea-level rise; Sylvilagus palustris hefneri","Geographic distribution; Lagomorph; Land use planning; Sylvilagus palustris hefneri; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Land use; Mammals; Sea level; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; conservation planning; ecological impact; ecosystem management; endangered species; geographical distribution; lagomorph; land use planning; migration; sea level change; species conservation; article; biodiversity; climate change; endangered species; environmental management; geography; global climate; habitat; lagomorph; land use; mammal; migration; nonhuman; species conservation; Sylvilagus palustris hefneri; vegetation; wildlife conservation; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Geographic Information Systems; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Risk Assessment; Seawater; Lagomorpha; Sylvilagus palustris hefneri",,,,,,"Bush, M.B., Silman, M.R., Urrego, D.H., 48,000 years of climate and forest change in a biodiversity hot spot (2004) Science, 303, pp. 827-829; Chen, E., Gerber, J.F., Myers, R.L., Ewel, J.J., Climate (1990) Ecosystems of Florida, pp. 11-34. , University of Central Florida Press Orlando; Daniels, R.C., White, T.W., Chapman, K.K., Sea-level rise: Destruction of threatened and endangered species habitat in South Carolina (1993) Environmental Management, 17, pp. 373-385; Faulhaber, C.A., (2003) Updated Distribution and Reintroduction of the Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit, , M.S. thesis, Texas A&M University, College Station; Feagin, R.A., Sherman, D.J., Grant, W.E., Coastal erosion, global sea-level rise, and the loss of sand dune plant habitats (2005) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 3, pp. 359-364; Fish, M.R., Côté, I.M., Gill, J.A., Jones, A.P., Renshoff, S., Watkinson, A.R., Predicting the impact of sea-level rise on Caribbean sea turtle nesting habitat (2005) Conservation Biology, 19, pp. 482-491; Forys, E.A., Humphrey, S.R., Home range and movements of the Lower Keys marsh rabbit in a highly fragmented habitat (1996) Journal of Mammalogy, 77, pp. 1042-1048; Forys, (1999) Journal of Wildlife Management, 63, p. 251; Forys, (1999) Landscape Ecology, 14, p. 177; Grabherr, G., Gottfried, M., Pauli, H., Climate effects on mountain plants (1994) Nature, 369, p. 448; Howe, S.E., (1988) Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit Status Survey, , United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Jacksonville Field Station Jacksonville, FL; (2001) Climate Change 2001, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
