Nowadays, the research of climate change is mainly based on climatic proxy using traditional statistical method. However, climatic system is nonlinear, non-stationary and hierarchical, which makes even harder to detect and analyze abrupt climate changes. As well known, climatic system is made up of several sub-systems, and there may be inherent connections between them; however, there is only a few research methods and theories in this field. This article introduces a new detecting method, the heuristic segmentation algorithm, which is well fitted to nonlinear and non-stationary time series. Then, through dealing with northern hemisphere tree rings and Beijing stalagmite based on high and low frequency series, we try to distinguish abrupt changes in different scales and disclose its physial mechanism. To define a new physical quantity, the abrupt density, and analyze the distribution characteristics of abrupt changes before and after 1000 a, We take Huabei area's climatic change as an example to explore the inherent connections between local area and global area.","Abrupt change; Global temperature change; Heuristic segmentation algorithm; Human activeness; Little ice stage",,,,,,,,"Gong, Z.-Q.; Department of Physics, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China",,,,,,,,10003290,,WLHPA,,"Chinese","Wuli Xuebao",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33344457082
