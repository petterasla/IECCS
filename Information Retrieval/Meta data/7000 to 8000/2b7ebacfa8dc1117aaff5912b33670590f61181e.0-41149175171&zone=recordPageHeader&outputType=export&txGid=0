The experimental design was a complete random block design that consisted of four replicate blocks, with each block containing a 15 m × 15 m control and heated plot. Black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] was the overstory species and Epilobium angustifolium was the dominant understory. Soil temperature was maintained (∼5°C) above the control soil temperature using electric cables inside water filled polyethylene tubing for each heated plot. Air inside a 7.3-m-diameter chamber, centered in the soil warming plot, contained approximately nine black spruce trees was heated ∼5°C above control ambient air temperature allowing for the testing of soil-only warming and soil+air warming. Soil surface CO2 flux (RS) was positively correlated (P &lt; 0.0001) to soil temperature at 10cm depth. Soil surface CO2 flux (RS) was 24% greater in the soil-only warming than the control in 2004, but was only 11% greater in 2005, while R S in the soil+air warming treatments was 31% less than the control in 2004 and 23% less in 2005. Live fine root mass (&lt; 2 mm diameter) was less in the heated than control treatments in 2004 and statistically less (P &lt; 0.01) in 2005. Similar root mass between the two heated treatments suggests that different heating methods (soil-only vs. soil + air warming) can affect the rate of decomposition. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Black spruce; Carboncycling; Climate change; Global warming; Picea mariana; Q10; Soil CO2 flux; Soil temperature acclimation","acclimation; boreal forest; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; ecosystem response; experimental design; global warming; soil carbon; soil temperature; Canada; Manitoba; North America; Thompson; Chamerion angustifolium; Epilobium; Picea mariana",,,,,,"Atkin, O.K., Edwards, E.J., Loveys, B.R., Response of root respiration to changes in temperature and its relevance to global warming (2000) New Phytologist, 147, pp. 141-154; Batjes, N.H., Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world (1996) European Journal of Soil Science, 47, pp. 151-163; Bond-Lamberty, B., Wang, C., Gower, S.T., A global relationship between the heterotrophic and autotrophic components of soil respiration?
