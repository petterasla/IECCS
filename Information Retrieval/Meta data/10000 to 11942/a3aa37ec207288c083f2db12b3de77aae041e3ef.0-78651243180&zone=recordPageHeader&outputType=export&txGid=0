It is based on the assumption that the regional warming will enhance the lower-level stability due to the thermal inertia of the sea with respect to its overlying air. The enhanced stability implies more effective trapping of the near surface moisture, and as a result-further increase of the relative humidity. The marine boundary layer over the Mediterranean is modeled. The central feature of the model is the marine inversion capping the marine moist air, which intensity is positively correlated with the stability. Simple calculations indicate that if the temperature increases, while the stability remains unchanged, the near-surface relative humidity would not be affected. But, an increase in the stability would result in an increase in the near-surface relative humidity. This prediction is validated through observed trends of the respective fields, using the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and soundings from the eastern Mediterranean. The results are consistent in indicating an increase in the near-surface temperature, the lower-level stability and the relative humidity over the eastern part of the Mediterranean, but not in its western part. The results for the eastern Mediterranean support the expectation for an aggravation of heat stress beyond that imparted by the temperature rise. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Coastal regions; Eastern Mediterranean; Enhanced stability; Heat stress; Marine boundary layers; Moist air; NCEP/NCAR; Near surface temperature; Near-surface; Potential change; Reanalysis; Regional warming; Relative humidities; Summer season; Temperature increase; Temperature rise; Thermal inertia; Coastal zones; Global warming; Moisture; Stability; Thermal stress; Atmospheric humidity; boundary layer; climate prediction; coastal zone; environmental stress; global warming; marine environment; moisture; numerical model; relative humidity; temperature effect; Mediterranean Region",,,,,,"Baldi, M., Dalu, G., Maracchi, G., Pasqui, M., Cesarone, F., Heat waves in the Mediterranean: a local feature or a large scale effect?
