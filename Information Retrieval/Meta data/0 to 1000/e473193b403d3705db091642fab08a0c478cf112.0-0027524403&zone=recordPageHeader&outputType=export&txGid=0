The technology is based on internal combustion engines running on natural gas. Electricity is generated with high efficiency from a fuel that has the lowest carbon to energy content of the fossil fuels. Furthermore, this form of CHP has the potential to be applied very widely. Viable installations could range from 40 kW(e) in small commercial buildings to over 50 MW(e) on large industrial sites. Small-scale CHP therefore offers great scope for reducing emissions of CO2, a major contributor to global warming. © 1993.","Economics; Environment; Small-scale CHP","combined heat and power; economic effect; emission reduction; environmental impact; small-scale production; UK; Chandipura virus",,,,,,"Evans, Environmental and Economic Implications of Small-Scale CHP (1990) Energy and Environment Paper No 3, , Energy Technology Support Unit, Harwell Laboratory, Didcot, UK; Evans, Environmental and Economic Implications of Small-Scale CHP (1990) Energy and Environment Paper No 3, , Energy Technology Support Unit, Harwell Laboratory, Didcot, UK; Evans, Environmental and Economic Implications of Small-Scale CHP (1990) Energy and Environment Paper No 3, , Energy Technology Support Unit, Harwell Laboratory, Didcot, UK; Jackson, Mitchell, Sweet, Study of leakage from the UK natural gas distribution system (1990) Energy Policy; Jackson, Mitchell, Sweet, Study of leakage from the UK natural gas distribution system (1990) Energy Policy; Industrial Combined Heat and Power: The Potential for New Users (1988) Energy Efficiency Series No. 7, , HMSO, London; Good Practice Guide No 1 (1989) Guidance Notes for the Implementation of Small-Scale Packaged Combined Heat and Power, , Energy Technology Support Unit, Harwell Laboratory, Didcot, Oxon; Good Practice Guide No 3 (1990) Introduction to Small-Scale Combined Heat and Power, , Energy Technology Support Unit, Harwell Laboratory, Didcot, UK; Op cit, Ref 1Op cit, Ref 1Op cit.
