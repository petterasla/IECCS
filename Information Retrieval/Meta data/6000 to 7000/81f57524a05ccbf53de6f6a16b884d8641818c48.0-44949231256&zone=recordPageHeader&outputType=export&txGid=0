We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems. Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species. Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable conditions. Although most researchers focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions, some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between climate change and invasive species that will influence how aquatic ecosystems and their biota will respond to novel environmental conditions. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Aquatic systems; Climate change; Global warming; Invasive species","sodium chloride; water; climate effect; disease; ecological impact; fish culture; freshwater ecosystem; global warming; ice cover; invasive species; new species; salinization; streamflow; survival; virulence; water temperature; animal; chemistry; climate; demography; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; fish; greenhouse effect; invertebrate; physiology; plant; review; temperature; Animals; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Greenhouse Effect; Invertebrates; Plants; Sodium Chloride; Temperature; Water",,"sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; water, 7732-18-5; Sodium Chloride, 7647-14-5; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Beebee, T.J.C., Amphibian breeding and climate (1995) Nature, 374, pp. 219-220; Bennett, W.A., Currie, R.J., Wagner, P.F., Beitinger, T.L., Cold tolerance and potential overwintering of the red-bellied piranha Pygocentrus nattereri in the United States (1997) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 126, pp. 841-849. , and; Bernardo, J.M., Ilheu, M., Matono, P., Costa, A.M., Interannual variation of fish assemblage structure in a Mediterranean River: Implications of streamflow on the dominance of native or exotic species (2003) River Research and Applications, 19, pp. 521-532. , and; Bossenbroek, J.M., Johnson, L.E., Peters, B., Lodge, D.M., Forecasting the expansion of zebra mussels in the United States (2007) Conservation Biology, 21, pp. 800-810. , and; Burgmer, T., Hillebrand, H., Pfenninger, M., Effects of climate-driven temperature changes on the diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates (2007) Oecologia, 151, pp. 93-103. , and; Carlton, J.T., Geller, J.B., Ecological roulette: The global transport of nonindigenous marine organisms (1993) Science, 261, pp. 78-82. , and; Clarkson, R.W., Effectiveness of electrical fish barriers associated with the Central Arizona Project (2004) North American Journal of Fisheries Management, 24, pp. 94-105; Cooney, S.J., Covich, A.P., Lukacs, P.M., Harig, A.L., Fausch, K.D., Modeling global warming scenarios in greenback cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii stomias) streams: Implications for species recovery (2005) Western North American Naturalist, 65, pp. 371-381. , and; Correia, A.M., Ferreira, O., Burrowing behavior of the introduced red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Decapoda: Cambaridae) in Portugal (1995) Journal of Crustacean Biology, 15, pp. 248-257. , and; Courtenay Jr., W.R., Nonindigenous fishes (1997) Strangers in Paradise; Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida., pp. 109-122. , Pages. in.
