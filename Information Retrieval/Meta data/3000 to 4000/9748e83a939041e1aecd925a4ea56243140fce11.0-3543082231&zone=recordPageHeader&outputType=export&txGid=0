L7R 4A6, Canada","The effects of global warming can increase the risk of exotic species introductions in eastern Canadian Arctic waters by reducing surface ice cover and allow increased access to commercial vessels. Ballast water discharged by incoming overseas vessels is an important means for introducing species on a global scale. Analyses of air temperatures at Churchill, Manitoba between 1943 and 2002 indicated an increase in mean temperature within the past decade. Churchill is the only major northern port in this region where grain has been exported on a limited basis due to the short navigation season. Economic analyses of grain exported from Canadian and U.S. ports indicated some cost advantages for using northern ports. The Hudson Bay region is vulnerable to increased exotic species introductions because of its southerly location. Current ballast water exchange measures to reduce the risk of introductions may not be effective because most vessels enter the region with ballast, and the ballast exchange zone is located relatively close to coastal areas where the habitat could be favorable for an introduced species to become established. The probability of a large crab species introduced to this region from northern European waters is discussed. The risk of ballast water-related exotic species introduction to this region may be reduced by expanding the types of cargo handled and developing a strong import market. This approach would accommodate an increase in the number of vessels with cargo, and substantially reduce the volume of ballast carried to this region.","Arctic region; Ballast water; Exotic species","Ballast tanks; Biodiversity; Coastal zones; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Economic and social effects; Global warming; Ice; Ocean habitats; Risk assessment; Commercial vessels; Exotic species; Surface ice cover; Environmental impact; ballast water; cargo handling; coastal water; global warming; introduced species; air temperature; Arctic; article; Canada; crab; economic aspect; environmental factor; Europe; grain; greenhouse effect; health care access; marketing; probability; risk; species introduction; water analysis; Animals; Animals, Wild; Arctic Regions; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Greenhouse Effect; Population Dynamics; Risk Assessment; Ships; Survival Analysis; Temperature; Transportation; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Biodiversity; Ice; Pollution Control; Risk Assessment; Vessels; Arctic; Canada; Canadian Arctic; North America; Decapoda (Crustacea)",,,,,,"Atkinson, E.G., Wacasey, J.W., Benthic invertebrate collected from Hudson Strait, Foxe Channel and Foxe Basin, Canada, 1949 to 1970 (1989) Canadian Data Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences No. 746, , Ottawa, Ontario, 102 PP; Barber, F.G., (1983) Macroalgae at 75 m in Hudson Bay.
