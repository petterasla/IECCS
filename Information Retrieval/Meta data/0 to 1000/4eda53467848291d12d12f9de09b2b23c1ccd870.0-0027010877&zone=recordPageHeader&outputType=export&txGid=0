The limited evidence available suggests that chance long distance dispersal events will be critically important in determining migration rates. The authors examine the JABOWA-derived gap replacement models and vital attributes/FATE models and ask what we need to know about dispersal and establishment to make improved projections of vegetation dynamics under climate change using these models. The minimal modifications of these models required to incorporate directional migration of species are described. To predict establishment success of species, a more fundamental understanding is needed of how establishment ability under different conditions relates to seed and seedling attributes and how this may be affected by elevated CO2. The authors examine whether plant functional types based on vegetative attributes (used to model the response of adult plants) are correlated with functional types based on seed and seedling attributes. Evidence suggests that the two sets of attributes are not strongly correlated; consequently, models of vegetation dynamics will need to incorporate seed biology explicitly. -from Authors",,"climatic change; dispersal; migration; vegetation dynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00671924,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027010877
