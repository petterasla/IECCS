This has potentially large ecosystem implications through changes in snowpack properties and ground-icing, which can block the access to herbivores' winter food and thereby suppress their population growth rates. However, the supporting empirical evidence for this is still limited. We monitored late winter snowpack properties to examine the causes and consequences of ground-icing in a Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) metapopulation. In this high-arctic area, heavy ROS occurred annually, and ground-ice covered from 25% to 96% of low-altitude habitat in the sampling period (2000-2010). The extent of ground-icing increased with the annual number of days with heavy ROS (≥10 mm) and had a strong negative effect onreindeer population growth rates. Our results have important implications as a downscaledclimate projection (2021-2050) suggests a substantial future increase in ROS and icing. The present study is the first to demonstrate empirically that warmer and wetter winter climate influences large herbivore population dynamics by generating ice-locked pastures. This may serve as an early warning of the importance of changes in winter climate and extreme weather events in arctic ecosystems. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Caribou; Climate change; Forage accessibility; Herbivore; Ice; Population dynamics; Rain-on-snow; Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus; ROS; Svalbard reindeer; Ungulat; Vegetation","ice; rain; snow; arctic environment; climate change; deer; future prospect; herbivore; population growth; sampling; snowpack; ungulate; wild population; animal; article; climate change; feeding behavior; growth, development and aging; Norway; physiology; plant; reindeer; season; Animals; Climate Change; Feeding Behavior; Ice; Norway; Plants; Rain; Reindeer; Seasons; Snow; Arctic; Rangifer tarandus",,"Ice",,,,"Aanes, R., Sæther, B.-E., Øritsland, N.A., Fluctuations of an introduced population of Svalbard reindeer: The effects of density dependence and climatic variation (2000) Ecography, 23, pp. 437-443; Aanes, R., Saether, B.-E., Smith, F.M., Cooper, E.J., Wookey, P.A., Areoritsland, N., The Arctic Oscillation predicts effects of climate change in two trophic levels in a high-arctic ecosystem (2002) Ecology Letters, 5 (3), pp. 445-453. , DOI 10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00340.x; Albon, S.D., Stien, A., Irvine, R.J., Langvatn, R., Ropstad, E., Halvorsen, O., The role of parasites in the dynamics of a reindeer population (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 269, pp. 1625-1632; Bartsch, A., Kumpula, T.K., Forbes, B.C., Stammler, F., (2010) Ecological Applications, 20, pp. 2346-2358; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multi-Model Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , Springer, Berlin, Germany; Coulson, S.J., Leinaas, H.P., Ims, R.A., Sovik, G., Experimental manipulation of the winter surface ice layer: The effects on a High Arctic soil microarthropod community (2000) Ecography, 23 (3), pp. 299-306; Engen-Skaugen, T., Haugen, J.E., Hanssen-Bauer, I., Dynamically downscaled climate scenarios available at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (2008) MET Report, , Oslo, Norway; Forchhammer, M., Boertmann, D., The muskoxen Ovibos moschatus in north and northeast Greenland: Population trends and the influence of abiotic parameters on population dynamics (1993) Ecography, 16, pp. 299-308; Fuglei, E., Oritsland, N.A., Prestrud, P., Local variation in arctic fox abundance on Svalbard, Norway (2003) Polar Biology, 26 (2), pp. 93-98; Gilg, O., Sittler, B., Hanski, I., Climate change and cyclic predator-prey population dynamics in the high Arctic (2009) Global Change Biology, 15, pp. 2634-2652; Grenfell, T.C., Putkonen, J., A method for the detection of the severe rain-on-snow event on Banks Island (2008) Water Resources Research, 44, pp. 1-9. , October 2003, using passive microwave remote sensing; Hansen, B.B., Aanes, R., Herfindal, I., Sæther, B.-E., Henriksen, S., Winter habitat-space use in a large arctic herbivore facing contrasting forage abundance (2009) Polar Biology, 32, pp. 971-984; Hansen, B.B., Aanes, R., Sæther, B.-E., Feedingcrater selection by high-arctic reindeer facing ice-blocked pastures (2010) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 88, pp. 170-177; Hansen, B.B., Aanes, R., Sæther, B.-E., Partial seasonal migration in high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) (2010) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 88, pp. 1202-1209; Hansen, B.B., Henriksen, S., Aanes, R., Saether, B.-E., Ungulate impact on vegetation in a two-level trophic system (2007) Polar Biology, 30 (5), pp. 549-558. , DOI 10.1007/s00300-006-0212-8; Hansen, B.B., Herfindal, I., Aanes, R., Sæther, B.-E., Henriksen, S., Functional response in habitat selection and the tradeoffs between foraging niche components in a large herbivore (2009) Oikos, 118, pp. 859-872; Helle, T., Kojola, I., Demographics in an alpine reindeer herd: Effects of density and winter weather (2008) Ecography, 31 (2), pp. 221-230. , DOI 10.1111/j.0906-7590.2008.4912.x; Ims, R.A., Henden, J.-A., Killengreen, S.T., Collapsing population cycles (2008) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 23 (2), pp. 79-86. , DOI 10.1016/j.tree.2007.10.010, PII S0169534707003552; Climate change 2007: Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (2007) Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC, Cambridge University Press, New York, New York, USA; Johansen, B., Tømmervik, H., Karlsen, S.R., (2009) Vegetasjonskart Over Svalbard Basert På Satellittdata, , In Norwegian.
