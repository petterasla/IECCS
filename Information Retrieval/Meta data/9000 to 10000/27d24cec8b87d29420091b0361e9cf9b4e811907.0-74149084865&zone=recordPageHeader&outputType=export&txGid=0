In the present study, pure plasma and plasma catalytic activation of methane and carbon dioxide were investigated for syngas production. For pure plasma process, the effects of discharge power, CH4/CO2 ratios in the feed, total flow rate, as well as the concentration of the balanced gas of Ar were studied. Ar in the feed has great effects on the conversion and the stability of the reaction. At 120 °C and atmospheric pressure, the conversion of CH4 increased from 39% to 56% and that of CO2 increased from 23% to 30% when the Ar content in the feed increased from 0% to 50%, whereas Ar showed little effect on the H2/CO ratios in the products. Moreover, the conversions of CH4 and CO2 remained unchanged within the testing hours in the presence of 50% of Ar, which was contrastive with those obtained without Ar in the feed. When Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was filled in the discharge gap at 450 °C, the synergism between the catalyst and dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma was achieved. Conversions of CH4 for plasma alone, plasma-catalysis and catalysis alone were 13%, 69% and 10%, respectively. Selectivities to CO and H2 under the plasma-catalytic process were, respectively, 76% and 57%. © 2009.","Cu-Ni/γ-Al2O3; Methane; Partial oxidation; Plasma; Synthesis gas","Catalytic activation; Catalytic process; Combined effect; Concentration of; Dielectric-barrier discharges; Discharge gaps; Discharge power; Methane partial oxidation; Plasma process; Plasma synthesis; Syn-gas; Syngas production; Utilization of methane; Argon; Atmospheric pressure; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalysis; Catalysts; Dielectric materials; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; High pressure effects; Methane; Oxidation; Plasmas; Synthesis (chemical); Synthesis gas; Electric discharges",,,,,,"Liu, C.J., Xu, G.H., Wang, T., (1999) Fuel Process Technol., 58, p. 119; Suzuki, S., Sasaki, T., Kojima, T., (1996) Energy Fuels, 10, p. 531; Motret, O., Pellerin, S., Nikravech, M., Massereau, V., Pouvesle, J.M., (1997) Plasma Chem.
