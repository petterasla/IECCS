The methodology chosen is the life cycle assessment (LCA), described in the international standard series ISO 14040-43. The functional unit has been defined as the production of 1 kWh of electricity. Energy use needed to construct, operate, and dismantle the power plants is estimated. These results are used to calculate the ""energy payback time"" of these technologies. Results were around 1 yr for both power plants. Environmental impacts analyzed include the global warming impacts along the whole life cycle of the power plants, which were around 200 g/kWh generated. Finally, the environmental impacts associated with the compliance of the solar thermal power objectives in Spain were computed. Those figures were then used to estimate the avoided environmental impacts including the potential CO2 emission savings that could be accomplished by these promotion policies. These savings amounted for 634 kt of CO2 equiv./yr.
