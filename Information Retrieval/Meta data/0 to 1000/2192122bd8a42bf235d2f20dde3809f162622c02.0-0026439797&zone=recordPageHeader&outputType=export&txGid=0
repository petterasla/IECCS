A major reduction of 38 years was found in the residence time for Lake Michigan (62 years as compared with the 100 year value previously reported) due to the consideration of flow exchange between Lakes Michigan and Huron. This indicates that Lake Michigan may respond much faster to reductions in contaminant loadings than previously expected. Because of their low ratio of volume to outflow, only Lakes Erie and Ontario are affected by normal climatic variations of less than 20 years in duration. Extreme lake level conditions over the period of 2 to 8 years can also significantly affect the residence times of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Thus high levels in the early 1970s may have contributed to the improvement of water quality in Lake Erie. Existing diversions and potential global warming appear to have no significant effect on residence times. -from Author",,"climate change; flushing rate; lake water quality; residence time; North America, Great Lakes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03801330,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026439797
