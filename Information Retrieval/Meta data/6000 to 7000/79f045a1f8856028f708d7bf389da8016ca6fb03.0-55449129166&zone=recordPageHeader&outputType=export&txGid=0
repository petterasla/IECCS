Here we show that these hydrologic changes may have a profound effect on mosquito population dynamics and rates of mosquito-borne disease transmission. We develop a simple model, which treats the mosquito reproductive cycle as a phase oscillator that responds to rainfall frequency forcing. This model reproduces observed mosquito population dynamics and indicates that mosquito-borne disease transmission can be sensitive to rainfall frequency. These findings indicate that changes to the hydrologic cycle, in particular the frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall events, could have a profound effect on the transmission rates of some mosquito-borne diseases. © 2007 Shaman, Day.",,"rain; airborne infection; article; controlled study; disease transmission; egg laying; host susceptibility; hydrology; mosquito; nonhuman; oscillatory potential; population dynamics; reproduction; seasonal population dynamics; sensitivity analysis; signal transduction; animal; climate; computer simulation; female; greenhouse effect; male; methodology; physiology; population dynamics; Animals; Climate; Computer Simulation; Culicidae; Female; Global Warming; Male; Mosquito Control; Population Dynamics; Rain; Reproduction",,,,,,"Kettle, D.S., (1995) Medical and Veterinary Entomology, , Wallingford, UK: CAB International. 725 p; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Geneva: IPCC. 881 p; (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Geneva: IPCC. 1032 p; Patz, J.A., Hulme, M., Rosenzweig, C., Mitchell, T.D., Goldberg, R.A., Climate change (Communication arising): Regional warming and malaria resurgence (2002) Nature, 420, pp. 627-628; Pascual, M., Ahumada, J.A., Chaves, L.F., Rodó, X., Bouma, M., Malaria resurgence in the East African highlands: Temperature trends revisited (2006) PNAS, 103, pp. 5829-5834; Gill, C.A., (1938) The Seasonal Periodicity of Malaria and the Mechanism of the Epidemic Wave, , London: J&A Churchill; Mitchell, C.J., Francy, D.B., Monath, T.P., (1980) Arthropod Vectors, pp. 313-379. , ed () St. Louis encephalitis.
