Adaptive governance strategies, however, remain a low priority for political leaderships in the MENA region. To date, most MENA governments have concentrated the bulk of their resources on large-scale supply side projects such as desalination, dam construction, inter-basin water transfers, tapping fossil groundwater aquifers, and importing virtual water. Because managing water demand, improving the efficiency of water use, and promoting conservation will be key ingredients in responding to climate-induced impacts on the water sector, we analyze the political, economic, and institutional drivers that have shaped governance responses. While the scholarly literature emphasizes the importance of social capital to adaptive governance, we find that many political leaders and water experts in the MENA rarely engage societal actors in considering water risks. We conclude that the key capacities for adaptive governance to water scarcity in MENA are underdeveloped. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Adaptive governance; Dam construction; Global climate changes; Groundwater aquifer; Hydrological data; Inter-basin water transfer; Low priorities; Middle East and North Africa; Political leadership; Social capitals; Virtual water; Water demand; Water experts; Water scarcity; Water sector; Water use; Aquifers; Climate models; Desalination; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; River basin projects; Water filtration; Water pollution; Water quality; Water supply; Climate change; adaptive management; aquifer; climate change; climate modeling; dam construction; data set; desalination; global climate; governance approach; political power; risk assessment; social capital; strategic approach; vulnerability; water availability; water demand; water quality; water resource; water use; Middle East; North Africa",,,,,,"Abderrahman, W.A., Water demand management in Saudi Arabia (2001) Water Management in Islam, , N.
