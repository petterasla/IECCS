Volta 6, 56126 Pisa, Italy","Gorgonian corals are long-lived, slow-growing species exhibiting slow population dynamics. Demographic data collected over a period of 11 yr on a small population of temperate, canopyforming gorgonians dwelling near the edge of the summer thermocline in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea enabled us to assess its responses to the large mortality events that occurred in 1999 and 2003. Changes in population density, size structure and recruitment were examined. Overall, 2101 adult colonies and recruits were observed in situ and 240 photographic plots analyzed. During the first 3 years (2004 to 2006) after the mass mortalities, our measurements revealed a dramatic reduction in the density of healthy colonies (90% suffered total or partial mortality), a shift in the dominant size class towards smaller size and a significant reduction in recruitment. In the following years (2007 to 2008) a significant recovery of injured colonies was found, with almost complete detachment of the dead colonies, a reduction in mortality and a 4-fold increase in recruitment. These findings indicate clear-cut restoration trends of the population, suggesting that recovery after extensive mortality could be faster than predicted by our current knowledge of gorgonian population dynamics. © Inter-Research 2009.","Eastern Ligurian Sea; Global climate change; Mass mortality; Octocorals; Paramuricea clavata; Population dynamics; Recruitment; Sediment cover","climate change; coral; global change; mass mortality; population dynamics; population size; thermocline; Mediterranean Sea; Anthozoa; Gorgonacea; Gorgonia; Paramuricea clavata",,,,,,"Airoldi, L., The effects of sedimentation on rocky coastal assemblages (2003) Oceanogr Mar Biol Annu Rev, 41, pp. 161-203; Astraldi, M., Gasparini, G.P., La circolazione costiera nel Mar Ligure Orientale (1986) Boll Mus 1st Biol Univ Genova, 52, pp. 317-331; Babcock, R., Davies, P., Effects of sedimentation on settlement of Acropora millepora (1991) Coral Reefs, 9, pp. 205-208; Ballesteros, E., Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages: A synthesis of present knowledge (2006) Oceanogr Mar Biol Annu Rev, 44, pp. 123-195; Bally, M., Garrabou, J., Thermodependent bacterial pathogens and mass mortalities in temperate benthic communities: A new case of emerging disease linked to climate change (2007) Glob Change Biol, 13, pp. 2078-2088; Beissinger, S.R., McCullough, D.R., (2002) Population Viability Analysis, , The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL; Bramanti, L., Magagnini, G., De Maio, L., Santangelo, G., Recruitment, early survival and growth of the Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum (L 1758), a 4-year study (2005) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 314, pp. 69-78; Bulleri, F., Benedetti-Cecchi, L., Acunto, S., Cinelli, F., Hawkins, S.J., The influence of canopy algae on vertical patterns of distribution of low-shore assemblages on rocky coasts in the northwest Mediterranean (2002) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 267, pp. 89-106; Caswell, H., (2001) Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis and Interpretation, , 2nd edn Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA; Cerrano, C., Bavestrello, G., Bianchi, C.N., Others And, C.R., A catastrophic mass-mortality episode of gorgonians and other organisms in the Ligurian Sea (north-western Mediterranean), summer 1999 (2000) Ecol Lett, 3, pp. 284-293; Cerrano, C., Arillo, A., Azzini, F., Others And, C.B., Gorgonian population recovery after a mass mortality event (2005) Aquat Conserv: Mar Freshw Ecosyst, 15, pp. 147-157; Cocito, S., Sgorbini, S., Bianchi, C.N., Zonation of a suspension-feeder assemblage on a temperate rocky shoal: The influence of water current and bottom topography.
