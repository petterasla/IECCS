State emissions are significant on a global scale. CO2 and CO are the main GHGs associated with global warning. At the present time, coal is responsible for 30-40% of the world CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. SO2 and NOx contribute to acid rain. Carbon assessments can play an important role in a strategy to control carbon dioxide emissions while raising revenue. In 1992, Turkish Ministry of Environment issued a regulation providing for emissions testing for cars, trucks and vans. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
