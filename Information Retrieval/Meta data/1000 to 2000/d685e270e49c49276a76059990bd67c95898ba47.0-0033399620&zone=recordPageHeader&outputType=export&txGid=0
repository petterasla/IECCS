The climate sensitivity of the coupled model using three different parametrisations of sub-grid scale mixing is 3°C for a doubling of CO2 (6°C for a quadrupling of CO2). This suggests that the ocean has only a weak feedback on global mean surface air temperature although significant regional differences, notably at high latitudes, exist with different sub-grid scale parametrisations. In the experiment using the Gent and McWilliams parametrisation for mixing associated with mesoscale eddies, an enhancement of the surface response in the Southern Ocean is found. This enhancement is largely due to the existence of more realistic sea-ice in the climatological control integration and the subsequent enhanced ice-albedo feedback upon warming. In accordance with earlier analyses, the Gent and McWilliams scheme decreases the global efficiency of ocean heat uptake. During the transient phase of all experiments, the North Atlantic overturning initially weakened but ultimately recovered, surpassing its former strength. This suggests that in the region around the North Atlantic the ocean acts as a negative feedback on local warming during the transient phase but a positive feedback at equilibrium. During the transient phase of the experiments with a more sophisticated and realistic parametrisation of sub-grid scale mixing, warmed Atlantic water was found to penetrate at depth into the Arctic, consistent with recent observations in the region.",,"climate feedback; coupling; global warming; oceanic general circulation model; parameterization",,,,,,"Böning, C.W., Holland, W.R., Bryan, F.O., Danabasoglu, G., McWilliams, J.C., An overlooked problem in model simulations of the thermohaline circulation and heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean (1995) J Clim, 8, pp. 515-523; Bryan, F., Parameter sensitivity of primitive equation ocean general circulation models (1987) J Phys Oceanogr, 17, pp. 970-985; Bryan, K., Lewis, L.J., A water mass model of the World Ocean (1979) J Geopohys Res, 84, pp. 2503-2517; Carmack, E.C., Macdonald, R.W., Perkin, R.G., McLaughlin, F.A., Pearson, R.J., Evidence for warming of Atlantic water in the southern Canadian Basin of the Arctic Ocean: Results from the Larsen-93 expedition (1995) Geophys Res Lett, 22, pp. 1061-1064; Danabasoglu, G., McWilliams, J., Sensitivity of the global ocean circulation to parametrization of mesoscale tracer transports (1995) J Clim, 8, pp. 2967-2987; Danabasoglu, G., McWilliams, J.C., Gent, P.R., The role of mesoscale tracer transports in the global ocean circulation (1994) Science, 264, pp. 1123-1126; Da Silva, A.M., Young, C.C., Levitus, S., Atlas of marine data 1994 (1994) Vol 3: Anomalies of Heat and Momentum Fluxes, 3, p. 99. , NOAA Atlas NESDIS 8, US Department of Commerce, NOAA, NESDIS, Washington, DC; England, M.H., Using chlorofluorocarbons to assess ocean climate models (1995) Geophys Res Lett, 22, pp. 3051-3054; Fanning, A.F., Weaver, A.J., An atmospheric energy-moisture balance model: Climatology, interpentadal climate change, and coupling to an ocean general circulation model (1996) J Geophys Res, 101, pp. 15111-15128; Fanning, A.F., Weaver, A.J., Temporal-geographical meltwater influences on the North Atlantic conveyor: Implications for the Younger Dryas (1997) Paleoceanogr, 12, pp. 307-320; Fanning, A.F., Weaver, A.J., On the role of flux adjustments in an idealized coupled climate model (1997) Clim Dyn, 13, pp. 691-701; Fanning, A.F., Weaver, A.J., A horizontal resolution and parameter sensitivity study of heat transport in an idealized coupled climate model (1997) J Clim, 10, pp. 2469-2478; Gent, P.R., McWilliams, J., Lsopycnal mixing in ocean circulation models (1990) J Phys Oceanogr, 20, pp. 150-155; Gill, A., (1982) Atmosphere-ocean Dynamics, p. 662. , Academic Press, London; Gordon, H.B., O'Farrel, S.P., Transient climate change in the CSIRO coupled model with dynamic sea ice (1997) Mon Weather Rev, 125, pp. 875-907; Graves, C.E., Lee, W.H., North, G.R., New parametrizations sensitivities for simple climate models (1993) J Geophys Res, 98, pp. 5025-5036; Griffes, A.M., Gnanadesikan, A., Pacanowski, R.C., Larichev, V.D., Dukowicz, J.K., Smith, R.D., Isoneutral diffusion in a z-coordinate model (1998) J Phys Oceanogr, 28, pp. 805-830; Hartman, D.L., (1994) Global Physical Climatology, p. 411. , Academic Press, San Diego; Hibler W.D.
