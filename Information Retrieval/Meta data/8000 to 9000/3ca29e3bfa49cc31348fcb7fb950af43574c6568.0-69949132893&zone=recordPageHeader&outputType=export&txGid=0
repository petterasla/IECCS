The determinant for such variation remains poorly understood. This study documented the activity of influenza over a 10-year period in Hong Kong; examining its association with changes in temperature and relative humidity. The two types of influenza exhibited different correlations with meteorological variations. Influenza A showed two seasonal peaks occurring respectively in winter/spring and summer months in most years. Influenza B showed a clear winter/spring peak, but its activity during summer months was more variable. Cold and humid conditions were associated with a higher activity of both influenza A and B. In contrast, hot and humid conditions were associated with a higher activity of influenza A, but were associated with only a moderate, less consistent increase in the activity of influenza B. A trend of increase in the magnitude of summer peaks of influenza A, but not influenza B, was observed. A hypothetical 2°C rise in temperature would decrease the proportion of favorable days for influenza A in December-April from 78% to 57%, but an increase from 58% to 71% in May-November; with a similar effect (from 83% to 62%) for influenza B during December-April, but a modest change (from 17% to 18%) during May-November. The presence of two seasonal peaks of influenza annually emphasizes the need to evaluate the duration of protective immunity offered by vaccination. Further study onthe effects of climate change and global warming on the activity of influenza is warranted. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Hong kong; Influenza; Meteorology; Season; Subtropical","article; climate change; disease activity; disease association; Hong Kong; human; humidity; immunity; influenza; Influenza virus A; Influenza virus B; nonhuman; seasonal variation; spring; summer; temperature; vaccination; winter; Climate; Hong Kong; Humans; Humidity; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; Influenza, Human; Seasons; Temperature",,,,,,"Chew, F.T., Doraisingham, S., Ling, A.E., Kumarasinghe, G., Lee, B.W., Seasonal trends of viral respiratory tract infections in the tropics (1998) Epidemiology and Infection, 121 (1), pp. 121-128. , DOI 10.1017/S0950268898008905; Chiu, S.S., Lung Lau, Y., Chan, K.H., Wong, W.H.S., Peiris, J.S.M., Influenza-related hospitalizations among children in Hong Kong (2002) New England Journal of Medicine, 347 (26), pp. 2097-2103. , DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa020546; Cox, N.J., Subbarao, K., Influenza (1999) Lancet, 354, pp. 1277-1282; Cox N, J., Subbarao, K., Global epidemiology of influenza: Past and present (2000) Annual Review of Medicine, 51, pp. 407-421. , DOI 10.1146/annurev.med.51.1.407; Dowell, S.F., Seasonal variation in host susceptibility and cycles of certain infectious diseases (2001) Emerg Infect Dis, 7, pp. 369-374; Dowell, S.F., Shang Ho, M., Seasonality of infectious diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome - What we don't know can hurt us (2004) Lancet Infectious Diseases, 4 (11), pp. 704-708. , DOI 10.1016/S1473-3099(04)01177-6, PII S1473309904011776; Hemmes, J.H., Winkler, K.C., Kool, S.M., Virus survival as a seasonal factor in influenza and poliomyelitis (1960) Nature, 188, pp. 430-431; (2008) Climate of Hong Kong, , http://www.weather.gov.hk/cis/climahk_e.htm, Hong Kong Observatory accessed November 5, 2008; Lee, T.C., Leung, W.M., Chan, K.W., Climatological normals for Hong Kong 1971-2000 (2006) Hong Kong Observatory Technical Note (Local) No.83, , Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, 2006; Leung, Y.K., Wu, M.C., Yeung, K.K., Leung, W.M., Temperature projections for Hong Kong in the 21st century (2007) Hong Kong Meteorol Soc Bull, 14, pp. 13-22; Lo, J.Y.C., Tsang, T.H.F., Leung, Y.-H., Yeung, E.Y.H., Wu, T., Lim, W.W.L., Respiratory infections during SARS Outbreak, Hong Kong, 2003 (2005) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 11 (11), pp. 1738-1741; Lofgren, E., Fefferman, N.H., Naumov, Y.N., Gorski, J., Naumova, E.N., Influenza seasonality: Underlying causes and modeling theories (2007) Journal of Virology, 81 (11), pp. 5429-5436. , DOI 10.1128/JVI.01680-06; Lowen, A.C., Mubareka, S., Steel, J., Palese, P., Influenza virus transmission is dependent on relative humidity and temperature (2007) PLoS Pathogens, 3 (10), pp. 1470-1476. , http://pathogens.plosjournals.org/archive/1553-7374/3/10/pdf/10. 1371_journal.ppat.0030151-L.pdf, DOI 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151; McMichael, A.J., Environmental and social influences on emerging infectious diseases: Past, present and future (2004) Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 359, pp. 1049-1058; IPCC, 2007: Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability: Contribution of the Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Parry M, Canziani O, Palutikof J, van der Linder P, Hanson C, (Eds.)
