Study species included five emergents and one canopy species. In the year of highest growth for individual species, mean diameter increments were 25-112% greater than in the year of least growth. These among-year differences were significant for five of the six species. For all six species, mean adult diameter increments were higher than average in 1985 and were lower than average in 1986 and 1988. In the class ≥ 50 cm tall and ≤ 1 cm diameter, mean diameter increments were 3-10 times greater in the year of highest growth than in the year of least growth. In each of the other two juvenile size classes (1-10 cm and 10-30 cm in diameter), two species showed highly significant among-year growth variations. Annual rainfall was not correlated with the annual growth patterns. Although the two years of highest overall growth, 1984 and 1985, were exceptionally dry, adult trees of two species showed their greatest growth in one of the highest rainfall years (1990). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) appears to control productivity of tropical wet forests. Recent data show strong year to year variation in monthly PAR. -from Authors",,"canopy tree; growth; photosynthetically active radiation; rain forest; Costa Rica, La Selva",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028164312
