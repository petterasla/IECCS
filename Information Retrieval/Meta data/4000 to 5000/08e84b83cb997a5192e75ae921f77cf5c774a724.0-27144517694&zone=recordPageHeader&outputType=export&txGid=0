The environmental burden impact indicator (EBII), the resources depletion impact indicator (RII), and the environmental impact comprehensive indicator (EICI) are defined. The specific environmental impact values of different grade concretes with or without fly ash were presented. In the embodied process of concrete with or without fly ash, the key potential environmental impact categories are global warming and dust emission, and it is an effective way for reducing the embodied environmental impact of concrete to mix fly ash and lower grade cement. The method presented in this paper makes it possible to quantitatively assess the embodied environmental impact of concrete with or without fly ash. The results calculated in this paper can be used to quantitatively assess the life cycle environmental impact of construction materials and buildings.","Concrete; Embodied environmental impact; Fly ash; Quantitative assessment",,,,,,,"Liu, S., Lin, Z., Kang, M., Environmental impact assessment of cement-concrete system (2000) J.
