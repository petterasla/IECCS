There is popular perception that heavy rainfalls have become more frequent, and that this trend will increase with global warming. Most of the literature examines this question from the point of view of climatology using definitions of ""heavy,""""very heavy,"" or ""extreme"" rainfall, which are different from those commonly used by civil engineers. This article identifies the differences in meaning used by the climate and civil engineering communities and examines trends in the observed record in the frequency of exceedances (not trends in magnitudes). Using concepts recognized as the basis for design of the Nation's civil infrastructure, we look at trends in the number of exceedances of thresholds for a variety of precipitation frequencies and event durations used by civil engineers. We found that the estimated trends in exceedances at one-day and multiday durations were statistically significant and increasing for the Ohio River Basin and surrounding states but the reverse was true for the Semiarid Southwest (i.e., not significant and decreasing trends). In addition, we found the magnitude of the trends was small for all but the more frequent events and also small with respect to the uncertainty associated with the precipitation frequency estimates themselves. © 2011 American Water Resources Association.","Climate variability/change; Precipitation; Rainfall frequency; Rainfall intensity; Stationarity; Statistics; Time series analysis","Civil engineers; Civil infrastructures; Climate variability/change; Engineering community; Heavy rainfall; Ohio River; Precipitation frequency; Rainfall frequency; Rainfall intensity; Semantic difference; Stationarity; Civil engineering; Climatology; Engineers; Global warming; Precipitation (chemical); Semantics; Statistics; Time series; Time series analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Rain; civil engineering; climate effect; climatology; global warming; perception; precipitation (climatology); precipitation intensity; rainfall; river basin; time series analysis; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis; United States",,,,,,"Bonnin, G.M., Martin, D., Lin, B., Parzybok, T., Yekta, M., Riley, D., (2006) NOAA Atlas 14 Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States Volume 2 Version 3.0: Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia.
