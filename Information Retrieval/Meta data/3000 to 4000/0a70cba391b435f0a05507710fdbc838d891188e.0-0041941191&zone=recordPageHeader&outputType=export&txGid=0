The data include the 220-year observed precipitation in Seoul, South Korea, the dryness-wetness intensity data in eastern China for the last 530 years, and other two independent chronologies of dryness-wetness grades in the past millennium in eastern China based on instrumental observations and historical documents. Various analysis methods including wavelet transform and rotated empirical orthogonal function were used in revealing climate variations from these datasets. Major results show that the dry and wet anomalies initially appeared in the north part of eastern China and then migrated southward to affect south China. This process is repeated about every 70 years. However, in contrast in the last two decades of the twentieth century a dry situation appeared in north China and a wet climate predominated in the south part of the country. The multidecadal variations of the monsoon circulation in East Asia and the thermal contrast between inland Asia and its surrounding oceans may contribute to the dry-wet phase alternation or the migration of dry-wet anomalies. In regional scale variations, a consistent dry or wet pattern was observed spreading from the lower Yangtze River valley to South Korea. Frequencies of severe dry-wet situations were low in the eighteenth and nineteenth century and they were higher in the twentieth century. The recent increasing trend in frequencies of severe dry-wet chances occurred along with global warming and regional climatic changes in China.",,"climate variation; decadal variation; Holocene; monsoon; spatiotemporal analysis; Asia",,,,,,"Bradley, R.S., Jones, P.D., Climate since AD 1500 (1992) Climate Since AD 1500, pp. 1-16. , Bradley RS, Jones PD (eds) Routledge, London; Brunet, Y., Collinean, S., Wavelet analysis of diurnal and nocturnal turbulence above a maize crop (1994) Wavelets in Geophysics, pp. 129-150. , Foufoula-Georgiou E, Kumar P (eds) Academic, San Diego, USA; (1981) Atlas of Flood and Drought in China in the Last 500 Years, p. 332. , Central Meteorological Bureau Cartological Press, Beijing, China; Cho, H.-K., Na, I.-S., Changes in climate in Korea during the eighteenth century-centering on rainfall amount (1979) J Korean Studies, 22, pp. 83-103. , in Korean; (1995) Report of the Damage Caused By Disaster in China, p. 406. , Damage Report China Statistical Press, Beijing, China; Fu, C.-B., Diaz, H.F., Dong, D.-F., Fletcher, J.O., Changes in atmospheric circulation over Northern Hemisphere oceans associated with the rapid warming of the 1920s (1999) Int J Climatol, 19, pp. 581-606; Hu, Q., Feng, S., A southward migration of centennial-scale variations of drought flood in eastern China and the western United States (2001) J Clim, 15, pp. 1323-1328; Jiang, J.-M., Zhang, D., Fraedrich, K., Historical climate variability of wetness in East China (1960-1992): A wavelet analysis (1997) Int J Climatol, 17, pp. 968-981; Jones, P.D., Recent warming in global temperature series (1994) Geophys Res Lett, 21, pp. 1149-1152; Jung, H.-S., Lim, G.-H., Oh, J.-H., Characteristics of the instrumental precipitation records during the last 220 years in Seoul, Korea (2000) Proc Climate Change and Variability and the 29th International Geophysical Congress, August 9-13, 2000, , Konkuk University, Seoul.
