Since agriculture has been implicated as one contributor to that increase, a monitoring program was undertaken during the 1993 and 1994 cropping season (May-October) to evaluate the effect of several soil management practices on N2O emission from still. Our results show that rates of N2O emission were generally near baseline levels during most sampling occasions. Major, but short-lived, fluxes of N2O were observed after rainfall events and during the days immediately following fertilized application. It was during these times that most of the seasonal N2O loss occurred. An excellent relationship was found between seasonal N2O loss (y) and the maximum daily flux of N2O (x) during a season (y = -0.4 x2 + 43.1 g + 338, r2 = 0.89, P &lt; 0.0001). The N2O emission data were log normally distributed for both years. Average daily emission of N2O were 69 ± 6.3 g (range, 0.3-74.7 g) N2O-N ha-1 day-1 and 17.6 ± 10.5 g (range, 0.1-326 g) N2O-N ha-1 day-1 during the 1993 and 1994 seasons, respectively. Seasonal N2O-N losses were, in general, highest in the continuous corn (CC) (Zea mays L.) plots and lowest in the soybean (Glycine max L.) plots of the corn/soybean/wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) rotation (CSW-V). Average N loss as N2O during a cropping season was between 0.6 kg (for the soybean crop of the CSWV rotation and ridge till treatment) and 3.7 kg N2O-N ha-1 year-1 (for the CC rotation and the chisel till treatment). Approximately 0.5-3% of the inorganic N fertilizer added was lost as N2O. Our data show that seasonal N2O-N loss from chisel-till plots were generally significantly higher than from no-till or ridge till plots.","Chisel tillage; Crop rotation; Cropping systems; Gaseous N losses; Greenhouse gases; N cycling; No-tillage; Ridge tillage","crop rotation; fertilizer; global warming; greenhouse gas; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; rainfall; soil management; tillage; USA, Ohio",,,,,,"Anderson, I.C., Levine, J.S., Poth, M.A., Riggan, P.J., Enhanced biogenic emissions of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide following surface biomass burning (1988) J.
