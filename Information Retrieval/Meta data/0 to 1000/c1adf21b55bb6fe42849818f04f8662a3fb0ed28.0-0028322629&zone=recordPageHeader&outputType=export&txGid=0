In this study we examine this possibility by using a coupled energy balance climate-thermo-dynamic sea ice model. Results indicate that if summer ice albedo is high enough, and there is some mechanism for initially maintaining ice through the summer season, then it may be possible to have ice sheet growth under the conditions of CO2 induced warming. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",,"atmospheric carbon dioxide; climate change; global warming; ice albedo; ice caps; ice sheet; precipitation",,,,,,"Andrews JT (1991) Association of ice sheets and sea level with global warming: a geological perspective on aspects of global change.
