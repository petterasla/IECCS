We use a reduced-gravity model to investigate the response of the Atlantic overturning circulation to changes in forcing. We find that variability at decadal and higher frequencies is confined to a single hemisphere. This implies that (a) overturning variability resulting from high frequency changes in buoyancy forcing in the Labrador and Greenland Seas will be limited to the North Atlantic, and (b) any observed decadal and higher frequency fluctuations in North Atlantic overturning can only result from changes in the surface fluxes within the North Atlantic basin itself. These results suggest that Southern Ocean wind forcing is not important for North Atlantic overturning on decadal and shorter timescales.",,"Catchments; Global warming; Gravitation; Climate change; Climate models; Global warming; Frequency fluctuations; Geophysics; Oceanography; global warming; meridional circulation; thermohaline circulation; Atlantic Ocean; High frequency HF; Higher frequencies; Meridional overturning circulations; Model experiments; Overturning circulation; Paleoclimate records; Reduced-gravity model; Thermohaline circulations",,,,,,"Broecker, W.S., The great ocean conveyor (1991) Oceanogr, 4, pp. 79-89; Cane, M.A., A mathematical note on Kawase's study of the deep-ocean circulation (1989) J.
