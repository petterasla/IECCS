The results showed that the amount of energy consumed in irrigated wheat production was 13 205.90 MJ ha -1 and in rainfed wheat production was 14 134. 93 MJ ha -1. In the surveyed farm holdings, the energy input-output ratio for the irrigated wheat was 3.80, while benefit-cost ratio was 0.81. The productivity of irrigated wheat was calculated to be 3.67. The energy input-output ratio for rainfed wheat was 2.51, while the benefit-cost ratio was 0.53. The productivity of rainfed wheat was calculated to be 2.43. About 77% of the total energy inputs used in irrigated wheat production was non-renewable, while only about 23% was renewable. The total energy input used in rainfed wheat production was non-renewable 75% and 25% renewable energy. This study suggested that diesel-oil and fertilizers were not efficiently used. Intensive input use in irrigated wheat and rainfed wheat raises some problems like environmental pollution and global warming.","Economic analysis; Fertilizer; Input-output energy; Productivity; Wheat","Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Altintas, G., (2006) Production input and cost of some crops grown in Tokat, , Amasya and Yozgat province, Tokat Soil and Water Resources Research Institute, Tokat; Canakci, M., Topakci, M., Akinci, I., Ozmerzi, A., Energy use pattern of some field crops and vegetable production: Case study for Antalya Region, Turkey (2005) Energy Conversion and Management, 46, pp. 655-666; De, D., Singh, S., Chandra, H., Technological impact energy consumption in rainfed soybean cultivation in Madhya Pradesh (2001) Apply Energy, 70, pp. 193-213; Erdal, G., Esengun, K., Erdal, H., Gunduz, O., Economic analysis of energy input in sugar beet production in the province of Tokat, Turkey (2007) Energy, 32, pp. 35-41; Esengun, K., Erdal, G., Gunduz, O., Erdal, H., An economic analysis and energy use in staketomato production in Tokat province of Turkey (2007) Renewable Energy, 32, pp. 1873-1881; (2007) FAOSTAT database, , http://www.faostat.fao.org/site/567/default.aspx, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Gul, U., Wheat (2004) Agricultural Economics Research Institute, 7 (15), pp. 1-2; Helsel, Z.R., Energy and alternatives for fertilizer and pesticide use (1992) Energy in world agriculture, 6, pp. 177-210. , In: Fluck RC, editor.
