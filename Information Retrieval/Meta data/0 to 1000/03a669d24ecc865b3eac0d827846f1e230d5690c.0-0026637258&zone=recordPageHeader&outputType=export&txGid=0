According to recent general circulation model calculations, by the year 2020 the global mean temperature will have risen to 1.3 to 2.5 °C above the preindustrial 1840 mean. By the year 2070, the range of temperature increase will be 2.4 to 5.1 °C, and sea level will have risen 33 to 75 cm. Measurements from Antarctic ice cores show temperature swings of 4 to 5 °C between ice ages and interglacial periods. Fossil fuel-based energy use through power generation and transportation is viewed as the major cause of the very recent and projected future temperature rise. Recent arguments of scientists and policy makers have increasingly focused on the exact scope of global-scale changes and consequences of the globally rising energy appetite. The question of global warming has become the most important scientific issue. © 1992.","Air pollution; Climate change; Greenhouse gases","chlorofluorocarbon; fossil fuel; methane; nitrous oxide; air pollution; air temperature; antarctica; carbon dioxide measurement; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; temperature measurement",,"methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,,"Mohnen, V.A.; Atmospheric Science Research Center, State University of New York, Albany, NY 12205, United States",,,,,,,,07307268,,ETOCD,,"English","Environ.
