We have elicited subjective probability intervals for the occurrence of such major changes under global warming from 43 scientists. Although the expert estimates highlight large uncertainty, they allocate significant probability to some of the events listed above. We deduce conservative lower bounds for the probability of triggering at least 1 of those events of 0.16 for medium (2-4 °C), and 0.56 for high global mean temperature change (above 4 °C) relative to year 2000 levels.","Climate change; xpert elicitation","accuracy; article; climate change; controlled study; greenhouse effect; priority journal; probability; scientist; temperature acclimatization; temperature sensitivity; Antarctic Regions; Climate; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Greenland; Ice Cover; Probability; South America; Trees",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Abrupt climate change (2003) Science, 299, pp. 2005-2010; Meehl, G.A., Stocker, T.F., (2001) Climate Change 2007-The Physical Science Basis, pp. 747-846. , Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, eds, Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK, pp; Alley, R.B., Clark, P.U., Huybrechts, P., Joughin, I., Ice-sheet and sea-level changes (2005) Science, 310, pp. 456-460; Smith, J.P., Schellnhuber, H.-J., Mirza, M.Q., (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, pp. 913-967. , Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, eds, Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, pp; (2006) Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, , Schellnhuber HJ, Cramer W, Nakicenovic N, Wigley T, Yohe G, eds , Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Lenton, T.M., Tipping elements in the earth's climate system (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 1786-1793; de Finetti, B., (1974) Theory of Probability, , John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK; Savage, L.J., (1954) The Foundation of Statistics, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Raiffa, H., (1968) Decision Analysis: Introductory Lectures on Choices Under Uncertainty, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Garthwaite, P.H., Kadane, J.B., O'Hagan, A., Statistical methods for eliciting probability distributions (2005) J Amer Stat Ass, 100, pp. 680-701; Kahneman, D., Slovic, P., Tversky, A., (1982) Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, , Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Morgan, M.G., Henrion, M., (1990) Uncertainty: A Guide to Dealing with Uncertainty in Quantitative Risk and Policy Analysis, , Cambridge Univ Press, New York; Cooke, R.M., (1991) Experts in Uncertainty, , Oxford Univ Press, Oxford; Oppenheimer, M., O'Neill, B.C., Webster, M., Agrawala, S., The limits of consensus (2007) Science, 317, pp. 1505-1506; Morgan, M.G., Keith, D.W., Subjective judgments by climate experts (1995) Environ Sci Technol, 29, pp. 468-476; Vaughan, D.G., Spouge, J.R., Risk estimation of collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet (2002) Clim Change, 53, pp. 65-91; Zickfeld, K., Expert judgements on the response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to climate change (2007) Clim Change, 82, pp. 235-265; Ramsey, F.P., (1931) The Foundations of Mathematics and Other Logical Essays, p. 156. , ed Braithwaite RB Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, pp; Winkler, R.L., The quantification of judgment: Some methodological suggestions (1967) J Amer Stat Ass, 62, pp. 1105-1120; Walley, P., (1991) Statistical Reasoning with Imprecise Probabilities, , Chapman and Hall, London; Troffaes, M.C.M., Decision making under uncertainty using imprecise probabilities (2007) Int J Approx Reas, 45, pp. 17-29; Clemen, R.T., Winkler, R.L., Combining probability distributions from experts in risk analysis (1999) Risk Analysis, 19, pp. 187-203; Gregory, J.M., A model intercomparison of changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation in response to increasing CO2 concentration (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, pp. L12703; Stouffer, R.J., Investigating the causes of the response of the thermohaline circulation to past and future climate changes (2006) J Clim, 19, pp. 1365-1387; Collins M, CMIP Modelling Groups (2005) El Niño- or La Niñ a-like climate change?
