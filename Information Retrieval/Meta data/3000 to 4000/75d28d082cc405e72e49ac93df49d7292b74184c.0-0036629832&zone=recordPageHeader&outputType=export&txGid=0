Field experimentation is the best way to gather data, but experimental data are specific to the management, soils and climate that represent the research site. Inadequate field data exist to address all management options across all soil types and climates. We have used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change inventory approach to estimate changes in soil carbon storage resulting from various land use and management options. We generate a regional assessment of the relative impact of implementing changes in agricultural management on soil carbon storage. For each agricultural region of the United States, we present an estimated annual change in soil carbon storage for each management option. Results should prove especially useful in evaluating management options and tradeoffs.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Global warming; IPCC; Soil organic carbon; Soil quality","agricultural management; carbon sequestration; soil carbon; soil management; United States",,,,,,"Black, A.L., Tanaka, D.L., A conservation tillage-cropping systems study in the Northern Great Plains of the United States (1997) Soil Organic Matter in Temperate Agroecosystems: Long-term Experiments in North America, pp. 335-342. , E.A.
