To capture the distinct susceptibilities associated with lack of infrastructure, potential property loss, and gross human exposure, we develop an integration of climate change projections and poverty, wealth, and population metrics. Our analysis shows that most nations of the world are threatened by the interaction of regional climatic changes with one or more relevant socioeconomic factors. Nations that have the highest levels of poverty, wealth, and population face greater relative exposure in those dimensions. However, for each of those socioeconomic indicators, spatial heterogeneity in projected climate change determines the overall international pattern of socioclimatic exposure. Our synthesis provides a critical missing piece to the climate change debate and should facilitate the formulation of climate policies that account for international variations in the threat of climate change across a range of socioeconomic dimensions. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate change; CMIP3; GCM; Global warming; Greenhouse gas","article; climate change; environmental exposure; greenhouse gas; policy; poverty; priority journal; social aspect; socioeconomics; Climate; Environmental Exposure; Greenhouse Effect; Human Activities; Humans; Population; Poverty; Vehicle Emissions",,"Vehicle Emissions",,,,"(2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group I (, eds Solomon S, Qin D, Manning M, Marquis M, Averyt K, Miller HL, Chen Z Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Stavins, R.N., (2004) Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 04-28, , Resources for the Future, Washington, DC; Giorgi, F., (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L08707; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Pal, J.S., Trapp, R.J., Giorgi, F., (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 15774-15778; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Pal, J.S., Giorgi, F., Gao, X., (2007) Geophys Res Lett, 34, pp. L11706; (2007) Summary for Policy Makers, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group I , Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; (2006) World Development Indicators 2006, , World Bank , World Bank, Washington, DC; (2007) World Development Indicators Database, , World Bank , World Bank, Washington, DC; Carter, T.R., Jones, R.N., Lu, X., Bhadwal, S., Conde, C., Mearns, L.O., O'Neill, B.C., Zurek, M.B., (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
