This poses increasing pressure on oil supply and reserves. Concomitant is the concern about environmental pollution, especially by carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion, with the risk of global warming. Environmental well-being requires a modified mix of energy sources to emit less carbon dioxide, starting with a move to natural gas and ending with the market penetration of renewable energies. Efforts should focus on advanced oil and gas production and processing technologies and on regeneratively produced fuels like hydrogen or bio-fuels as well. Within the framework of an industrial initiative in Germany, a process of defining one or two alternative fuels was started, to bring them into the market within the next years.",,"Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Hydrogen fuels; Renewable energy resources; Synthetic fuels; Biofuels; Fossil energy reserves; Automotive fuels",,,,,,,"Isenberg, G.; Daimler-Benz, Reseach Cent Ulm, Ulm, Germany",,,"Elsevier Sequoia SA, Lausanne, Switzerland",,,,,03787753,,JPSOD,,"English","J Power Sources",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033361454
