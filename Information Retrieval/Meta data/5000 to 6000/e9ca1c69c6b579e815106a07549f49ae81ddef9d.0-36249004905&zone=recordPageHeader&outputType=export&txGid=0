The GNSS technique was incorporated into a float based tide gauge system. A prototype of such an instrument was developed based on principles of conventional tide gauges, where high frequency noise is reduced mechanically. The ability of the GNSS based tide gauge (GTG) to monitor sea levels was tested in several experiments. The performance of the GTG was compared to that of a traditional tide gauge. The method of data analysis and data comparison between the GPS measurements and the tide gauge data is presented. The results show that the GTG is equal in performance to the traditional float operated tide gauge. It seems that the GTG is capable of delivering the same level of accuracy (1 cm), and its results are as reliable as its competitor, the traditional float tide gauge. The suggested instrument can be easily integrated into the array of permanent GNSS stations and assist in absolute measurements of sea level changes, caused by global warming and the greenhouse effect, for example.",,"GNSS; measurement method; remote sensing; sea level change; tide gauge",,,,,,"Ben-Michel, C., Even-Tzur, G., Monitoring sea level using GPS - The difference between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea levels as a test case (2006) XXIII International FIG Congress, , Munich, Germany; Bingley, R.M., Dodson, H., Teferle, N., Baker, F., GPS monitoring of changes in ground level for flood and coastal defense (2001) 36th MAFF Conference of River and Coastal Engineers, , Keele, UK; Estey, L.H., Meertens, C.M., TEQC: The multi-purpose toolkit for GPS/GLONASS data (1999) GPS Solutions, 3 (1), pp. 42-49; (1985) Manual on Sea Level Measurement and Interpretation, , Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Volume I-Basic Procedures, UNESCO; (2006) Manual on Sea Level Measurement and Interpretation, Volume IV: An Update to 2006, JCOMM Technical Report No., , Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission; Mitchum, G.T., An overview of tide gauge measurements (1997) IGS Workshop on Methods for Monitoring Sea Level, , March 17-18; Neilan, R., Van Scoy, P.A., Woodworth, P.L., (1997) Proceedings of the Workshop on Methods for Monitoring Sea Level: GPS and Tide Gauge Benchmark Monitoring, , GPS altimeter calibration, Workshop organized by the IGS and PSMSL, Pasadena, CA; Teferle, F.N., Strategies for long-term monitoring of tide gauges using GPS (2003), University of Nottingham, Institute of Engineering Surveying and Space Geodesy, Ph.D. thesisYang, M., Lo, C.F., Real-time kinematic GPS positioning for centimeter level ocean surface monitoring (2000) Natl.
