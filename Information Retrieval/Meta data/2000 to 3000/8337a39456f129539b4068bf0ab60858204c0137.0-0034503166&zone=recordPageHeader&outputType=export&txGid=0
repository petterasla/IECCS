Consequently, interannual variations in regions such as the intermountain West, with snowmelt annual maximum floods, may be related to low-frequency variations in winter/spring large-scale climate variability. Changes in the seasonality of basin precipitation and temperature consequent to slow changes in the baseline climate state (e.g., owing to natural climate variations and/or potential global warming trends) may have significant impacts on such floods. A case study of the Blacksmith Fork River in northern Utah that explores such a hypothesis is presented here. Trends and associations in the magnitude and timing of annual maximum floods are documented, their impact on time-varying estimates of the 100 year flood is assessed, and relationships with known large-scale, quasi-oscillatory patterns of climate variability are explored. Evidence for structured low-frequency variation in flood timing and magnitude and its relation to winter/spring precipitation and temperature and to tropical (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) and extratropical (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) Pacific climate precursors is presented. Mechanisms for these ocean-atmosphere teleconnections to basin precipitation, temperature, and flood potential are discussed.",,"climate; flood; melting; snow; climate variation; flood; magnitude; snowmelt; United States",,,,,,"Alexander, W.P., Grimshaw, S.D., Treed regression (1996) J.
