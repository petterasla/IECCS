In addition there is both growing evidence and concern that changes in rainfall patterns associated with global warming may substantively affect the nature of such risk. Eighty-nine years of daily rainfall data from a site in southern Zambia are analysed. The analyses illustrate approaches to assessing the extent of possible trends in rainfall patterns and the calculation of weather-induced risk associated with the inter-and intra-seasonal variability of the rainfall amounts. Trend analyses use monthly rainfall totals and the number of rain days in each month. No simple trends were found. The daily data were then processed to examine important rain dependent aspects of crop production such as the date of the start of the rains and the risk of a long dry spell, both following planting and around flowering. The same approach is used to assess the risk of examples of crop disease in instances when a 'weather trigger' for the disease can be specified. A crop water satisfaction index is also used to compare risks from choices of crops with different maturity lengths and cropping strategies. Finally a different approach to the calculations of these risks fits a Markov chain model to the occurrence of rain, with results then derived from this model. The analyses shows the relevance of this latter approach when relatively short daily rainfall records are available and is illustrated through a comparison of the effects of El Niño, La Niña and Ordinary years on rainfall distribution patterns. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.",,,,,,,,"Allen, G.R., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., Crop evapotranspiration-Guidelines for computing crop water requirements (1998) FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56; Brown, M.E., (2008) Famine Early Warning Systems and Remote Sensing Data, , Berlin: Springer; Cooper, P.J.M., Dimes, J., Rao, K.P.C., Shapiro, B., Shiferaw, B., Twomlow, S., Coping better with current climatic variability in the rain-fed farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa: An essential first step in adapting to future climate change?
