Among them allergies to airborne pollen might increase or change in pattern due to the invasion of new allergic plants or due to different behavior of plants like earlier flowering. In this study we used the longest Swiss airborne pollen data set to examine the influence of the temperature increase on the time of flowering. In the case of Basel, where pollen data for 39 years are available, it was shown that due to a temperature increase the start of flowering in the case of birch occurred about 13 days earlier. Apart from a shift of the start of the flowering there is also a trend to higher annual birch pollen quantities and an increase in the daily maximal pollen concentration. Due to global warming and because symptoms might appear earlier in the year people suffering from a pollen allergy might face a new unaccustomed situation. © 2008 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.","Airborne pollen distribution; Climate change; Environmental observations; Pollen allergy","article; birch; climate change; flowering; greenhouse effect; human; pollen; pollen allergy; pollen development; pollen germination; sea level rise; Switzerland; weather",,,,,,"Alley, R., IPCC 2007.
