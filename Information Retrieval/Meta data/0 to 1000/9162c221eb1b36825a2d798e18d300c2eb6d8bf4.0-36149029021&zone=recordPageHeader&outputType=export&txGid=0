The problem can be ameliorated by reducing fossil fuel consumption through conservation and expanded use of nuclear and solar power. In particular, major reductions can be achieved if fossil fuels are replaced in electricity generation and if electricity assumes a larger role in the overall energy economy.","Carbon dioxide; Electricity use; Global warming; Nuclear power",,,,,,,,"Bodansky, D.; Dept. of Phys., Washington Univ., Seattle, WA, United States",,,,,,,,07413335,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-36149029021
