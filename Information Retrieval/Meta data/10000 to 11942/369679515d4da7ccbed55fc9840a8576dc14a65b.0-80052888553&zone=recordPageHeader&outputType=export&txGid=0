Temperature, precipitation and hydrology data during the past 29 years from 1979 to 2007 were collected and analyzed using parametric and non-parametric methods, the connection between temperature and precipitation by the combination of grey correlation analysis method and the hypothesis testing for trend of climate change. The results show a high increase in temperature in the study area as well as an extreme and highly variable hydrological regime in this region, where flash floods can exceed the total runoff from a sequence of years. These variations may be due to the geographical location of the Kaidu River Basin in arid zone. It also reveals that precipitation has a much greater impact on stream flow than that of temperature. The development of new approaches was proposed as responses to climate change in this arid region. © 2011 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Global warming; Kaidu River; Precipitations; Stream flow; Temperature",,,,,,,"Bindoff, N., Solomon, S.D., Qin, D., Manning, M., Chen, Z., Marquis, M., Averyt, K.B., Miller, H.L., (2007) The Physical Science Basis: Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. 125. , Cambridge, UK, USA, chap. 5; Bloomfield, P., Nychka, D.W., Climate spectra and detecting climate change (1992) Climate Change, 21, pp. 275-287; Box, J.E., Cohen, A.E., Upper-air temperatures around Greenland: 1964-2005 (2006) Geophysical Research Letters, 33. , (L12706). doi: 10. 1029/2006GL025723; Chen, J., An, Z.S., Liu, L.W., Ji, J.F., Yang, J.D., Chen, Y., Variations in chemical compositions of the eolian dust in Chinese Loess Plateau over the past 2.5 Ma and chemical weathering in the Asian inland (2001) Science in China (Series D), 44 (5), pp. 403-413; Chen, Y., Takeuchi, K., Xu, C., Chen, Y., Xu, Z., Regional climate change and its effects on river runoff in the Tarim Basin (2006) China: Hydrological Processes, 20 (10), pp. 2207-2216; Chen, Y.N., Li, W.H., Chen, Y.P., Zhang, H.F., Water resources and ecological problems in Tarim River Basin, Xinjiang, China (2003) Water and Environmental Management, pp. 3-12. , P.
