A number of studies of the potential effects of climate change on the Great Lakes were commissioned by the US Environmental Protection Agency, using common scenarios of global warming derived mainly from general circulation models. These studies found that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere could eventually lower Great Lakes water levels by 0.5 to 2.5m; reduce ice cover by 1 to 2 1/2 months; lengthen shipping season while increasing shipping and dredging costs; reduce dissolved oxygen levels in shallow lake basins; and increase fish productivity. Measures should be taken in the near future to anticipate many of these impacts and mitigate their effects or avoid costly political issues. -Author",,"climate change; environmental impact; global warming; water level; Canada, Great Lakes; USA, Great Lakes; Climate; Global Warming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026359030
