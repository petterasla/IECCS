Climatologists say the world cannot wait 20 years for alternative fuels to start reversing the global warming trend-line, since by then considerable climate alteration and coastal damage will be manifest. The point is to dramatically reduce CO2, a by-product of internal combustion engine operations, as quickly as feasible to overcome the half-century lead-time of CO2 buildup already in the atmosphere. Since CO2 production correlates directly with vehicle mass, this paper makes the case for quickly reducing vehicle size. It also argues for re-introducing electric vehicles on a large scale, and altering the conventional highway configuration to achieve greater productivity. Fuel cells, even when fully accepted, will not improve important aspects of modern urban transport such as safety and traffic flow.","Alternative fuels; CO2 reduction; Electric vehicles; Highway configuration; Right-of-way productivity","Byproducts; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Internal combustion engines; Productivity; Synthetic fuels; Traffic control; Transportation; CO2 reduction; Highway configuration; Right-of-way productivity; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Hoffert, M.I., Caldeira, K., Benford, G., Advanced technology paths to global climate stability: Energy for a greenhouse planet (2002) Science, 298, pp. 981-987; (2001) Summary for Policymakers, , www.ipcc.ch/pub/spm22-01.pdf, A Report of Working Group 1 of the IPCC; (2002) Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2002 (122nd Edition), , Washington, DC (also earlier editions); (2003) Pocket Guide to Transportation, , BTS03-01, US Dept. of Transportation, Washington, DC (also earlier editions); noteMastoshi, A., (1975) Traffic Quarterly, 29 (4). , The Eno Foundation for Transportation; Mumford, L., (1981) The Highway and the City, , Greenwood Press, Westport, CO; Jacobs, J., (1961) The Death and Life of Great American Cities, , Vintage Books, New York; Goodman, R., (1972) After the Planners, , Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK; Wright, P.A., Ashford, N.J., Stammer, R.J., (1998) Transportation Engineering: Planning and Design, , 4/e, John Wiley & Sons, New York; Riley, R.Q., (1994) Alternative Cars in the 21st Century: A New Personal Transportation Paradigm, , SAE Inc., Warrendale, PA; (2002) World Development Indicators 2002, , Oxford U.P., New York (also earlier editions); Yarrow, A.L., Galloping Ghosts!
