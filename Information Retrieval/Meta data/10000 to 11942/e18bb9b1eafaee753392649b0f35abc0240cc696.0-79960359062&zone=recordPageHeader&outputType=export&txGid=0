However, since the late 1990s, the Nile basin countries-with the encouragement and support of the international community-have made some attempts to establish basin-wide cooperative institutions. This process of engagement and collaboration is presently under severe stress due to increasing demand and decreasing supply of water resources in the basin. This situation may be complicated further by the global climate change, which is anticipated to result in long-term changes in the volume and pattern of runoff in the Nile River system. Moreover, the emergence of China as a major player in the power politics of the Nile basin has facilitated a number of unilateral initiatives for large-scale water development projects. In this context, this paper critically examines the survival and sustainability of water cooperation endeavours in the Nile basin as the river faces challenges from the global climate change and shifting regional geo-politics. © 2011 IAHS Press.","China; Climate change; Nile Basin Initiative; Nile River; Water conflicts; Water sharing","20th century; Changing climate; China; Ethiopia; Global climate changes; Long-term changes; Low-intensity conflicts; Nile Basin Initiative; Nile River; Power politics; River systems; Water conflicts; Water development; Rivers; Water resources; Climate change; climate change; geopolitics; hydrological response; international agreement; resource development; river management; runoff; water demand; water management; water relations; water resource; water supply; China; Egypt; Ethiopia; Nile Basin; Sudan",,,,,,"(1998) Africa Research Bulletin, 35 (3); (1999) International Rivers and Lakes, p. 32. , December, 14; (2000) Policy for integrated water resources management: Draft, , African Development Bank; Amosu, A., (2007) China in Africa: It is (still) the governance, stupid, , Washington, DC: Institute for Policy Studies; Beyene, T., Lettenmaier, D.P., Kabat, P., Hydrologic impacts of climate change on the Nile River Basin: Implications of the 2007 IPCC scenarios (2010) Climate Change, 100 (3-4), pp. 433-461; Brewer, N., (2008) The New Great Wall-A guide to China's overseas dam industry, , Berkeley, CA: International Rivers Network; Christiansen, S., Shared benefits, shared problems (1992) The Environment and international security, p. 57. , In: S.
