Specifically, the TC PI is calculated for phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) integrations during the first 70 yr of a transient run forced by a 1% yr -1 CO 2 increase. The linear trend over the period is used to project a 70-yr change in relevant model parameters. The results for a 15-model ensemble-mean climate projection show that the thermodynamic potential intensity (THPI) increases on average by 1.0% to~3.1% over various TC basins, which is mainly attributed to changes in the disequilibrium in enthalpy between the ocean and atmosphere in the transient response to increasing CO 2 concentrations. This modest projected increase in THPI is consistent with that found in other recent studies. In this paper the effects of evolving large-scale dynamical factors on the projected TC PI are also quantified, using an empirical formation that takes into account the effects of vertical shear and translational speed based on a statistical analysis of present-day observations. Including the dynamical efficiency in the formulation of PI leads to larger projected changes in PI relative to that obtained using just THPI in some basins and smaller projected changes in others. The inclusion of the dynamical efficiency has the largest relative effect in the main development region (MDR) of the North Atlantic, where it leads to a 50% reduction in the projected PI change. Results are also presented for the basin-averaged changes in PI for the climate projections from each of the 15 individual models. There is considerable variation among the results for individual model pro- jections, and for some models the projected increase in PI in the eastern Pacific and south Indian Ocean regions exceeds 10%. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate projection; Control parameters; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Dynamical efficiency; Eastern pacific; Individual models; Model parameters; North Atlantic; South Indian Ocean; Statistical analysis; Thermodynamic potentials; Transient response; Tropical cyclone; Vertical shear; Control system analysis; Global warming; Hurricanes; Marine applications; Oceanography; Storms; Thermal conductivity; Climate models; atmospheric dynamics; carbon dioxide; computer simulation; ensemble forecasting; enthalpy; global warming; precipitation intensity; thermodynamics; trend analysis; tropical cyclone; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (East); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East)",,,,,,"Anthes, R.A., Corell, R.W., Holland, G., Hurrell, J.W., MacCracken, M.C., Trenberth, K.E., Hurricanes and global warming-Potential linkages and consequences (2005) Bull.
