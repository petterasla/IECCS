This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Sasa invasion on Global Warming Potential (GWP) in Sphagnum-dominated poor fen at Bibai, central Hokkaido, Japan. Fluxes of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O at Sphagnum-dominated site (Sp) and Sasa invasion site (Sa) were measured by a closed chamber method, using a rectangular transparent acryl chamber, 30 cm x 30 cm x 60 cm (length x width x height), to cover whole plant bodies during the measurement. CO 2 flux measured by this method gives an estimate of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), also known as net CO 2 exchange. Respiration rate was measured by using a shaded chamber. GWP was calculated using a 100-year time horizon recommended by IPCC (factors of 21 for CH 4 and 310 for N 2O). NEE was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) at Sa (223.8 g C m -2 y -1) than at Sp (5.8 g C m -2 y -1). CH 4 emission was higher at Sp (13.2 g C m -2 y -1) than at Sa (6.6 g C m -2 y -1), although the difference between the two sites is not significant. The contribution of CH 4 emission during the snow period (from snow cover to snow melting) to the total annual CH 4 emission accounted for 12% at Sp and 10% at Sa. N 2O emissions were 0.032 and 0.005 g N m -2 y -1 at Sp and Sa, respectively. The estimated GWP was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) at Sa (1009 g CO 2 m -2 y -1) than at Sp (408 g CO 2 m -2 y -1) and the contribution of CO 2 emission to GWP was greater at Sa (81 %) than at Sp (5%). Thus, we conclude that Sasa invasion in Sphagnum-dominated poor fen contributes to global warming due to increased CO 2 emission.","Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas; Poor fen; Sasa invasion; Sphagnum","Sasa; Sphagnum",,,,,,"Alm, J., Saarnio, S., Nykänen, H., Silvola, J., Martikainen, P., Winter CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O fluxes on some natural and drained boreal peatlands (1999) Biogeochemistry, 44, pp. 163-186; Armentano, T.V., Menges, E.S., Patterns of change in the carbon balance of organic soil-wetlands of the temperate zone (1986) J.
