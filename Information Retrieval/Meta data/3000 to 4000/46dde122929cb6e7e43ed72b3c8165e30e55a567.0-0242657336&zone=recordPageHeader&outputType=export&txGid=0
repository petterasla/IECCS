Soil and water conservation are, therefore, key requirements for sustaining productivity and environmental quality in semi-arid cropping systems. Great attention has been paid to the management of, demand for, and more efficient use of water. The comprehensive technical strategies reviewed in this paper include conserving water to combine both increased agricultural productivity and resource conservation; enquiries into how wheat plants respond to drought through morphological, physiological and metabolic modifications that occur in all plant organs; breeding for drought tolerance where there is a delineated stress environment and genotype x environment interactions are stable; and effective conservation of rainfall and high efficiency of use. Valuable techniques such as conservation tillage, mulch cultivation, limited irrigation, introduction of drought-tolerant varieties and rotation systems can be adjusted to local agricultural practices.","Physiological adaptation; Water conservation; Wheat production; Yield improvement","Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Barros, L.C.G., Hanks, R.J., Evapotranspiration and yield as affected by mulch and irrigation (1993) Agronomy Journal, 85, pp. 692-697; Biemelt, S., Keetman, U., Albrecht, G., Re-aeration following hypoxia or anoxia leads to activation of the antioxidative defense system in roots of wheat seedlings (1998) Plant Physiology, 116, pp. 651-658; Blum, A., Crop responses to drought and the interpretation of adaptation (1996) Plant Growth Regulation, 20, pp. 135-148; Deng, X.P., Shan, L., Inanaga, S., High efficient use of limited irrigation water by dryland spring wheat (1995) Agricultural Research in the Arid Areas, 13 (3), pp. 42-46; Deng, X.P., Shan, L., Inanaga, S., Daily photosynthetic characteristics of spring wheat in four growth stages on the Loess Plateau of China (1996) Crop Research in Asia: Proceedings of the 2nd Asian Crop Science Conference, pp. 560-561; Deng, X.P., Shan, L., Inanaga, S., Sensitivity and resistance of seedling establishment to water stress in spring wheat (2002) Cereal Research Communications, 30, pp. 125-132; Deng, X.P., Shan, L., Ma, Y.Q., Inanaga, S., Diurnal oscillation in the intercellular CO2 concentration of spring wheat under the semiarid conditions (2000) Photosynthetica, 38 (2), pp. 187-192; Deng, X.P., Wang, S.Q., Peng, K.S., Assessment of food productive potential on the different land type in the middle-scale eco-agricultural research area of Yan'an (2000) Journal of Chinese Soil and Water Conservation, 14 (5), pp. 87-91; Dhanda, S.S., Sethi, G.S., Inheritance of excised-leaf water loss and relative water content in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) (1998) Euphytica, 104, pp. 39-47; Fred, P., Water supply: The world's next challenge (1991) New Scientist, 129, pp. 34-40; Gamo, M., Classification of arid regions by climate and vegetation (1999) Journal of Arid Land Studies, 1, pp. 9-17; Harlan, J., Centers of origin (1987) Handbook of Plant Science in Agriculture, pp. 15-21. , B.
