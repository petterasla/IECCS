The Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is applied to simulate the effects of temperature on the hydrology and sediment and nutrient load in the lower Pearl River Basin, South China. Calibration and validation results for SWAT showed that the Yamen estuary is appropriate for simulating the impacts of temperature change on both hydrological processes and nutrient input. Thepossible temperature change scenarios were set at T-2, T-1.5, T-1, T-0.5, T+0.5, T+1, T+1.5, T+2, T+2.5, T+3°C compared to the current temperature, T°C. The results showed that the relative variation of discharge with temperature was slight. The sediment load at T+3°C is increased by 13.58% compared to that at T°C. Inorganic N and P inputs to the Yamen estuary showed an increasing trend with the temperature increase from T-2°C to T+3°C. Global warming can reduce the vegetation land cover by slowing plant growth, which will aggravate the water and soil loss. Temperature changes would have an effect on mineralization and nitrification by changing soil temperature and temperatures. The warming is projected to cause an increase of sediment and nutrient load into the estuary and accelerate eutrophication in the coastal area. © 2011 IAHS Press.","Discharge; Nutrient; Pearl river; Sediment; SWAT model; Temperature change","Assessment tool; Coastal area; Discharge; Effects of temperature; Hydrological process; Land cover; Nutrient loading; Nutrient loads; Pearl River; Pearl River basin; Plant growth; Sediment loads; Soil loss; Soil temperature; South China; SWAT model; Temperature change; Temperature changes; Temperature increase; Validation results; Water discharges; Anoxic sediments; Coastal zones; Estuaries; Eutrophication; Gems; Geologic models; Global warming; Nutrients; Rivers; Sedimentology; Soils; Watersheds; Temperature; calibration; climate change; coastal zone; estuary; eutrophication; fluvial deposit; hydrological modeling; mineralization; model validation; nitrification; nutrient; river discharge; soil temperature; temperature effect; Pearl Basin; United States",,,,,,"Aber, J.D., Ollinger, S.V., Federer, C.A., Reich, P.B., Goulder, M.L., Kicklighter, D.W., Melillo, J.M., Lathrop Jr., R.G., Predicting the effects of climate change on water yield and forest production in the northeastern United States (1995) Climate Research, 5 (3), pp. 207-222; Arnold, J.G., Fohrer, N., SWAT 2000: Current capabilities and research opportunities in applied watershed modeling (2005) Hydrol.
