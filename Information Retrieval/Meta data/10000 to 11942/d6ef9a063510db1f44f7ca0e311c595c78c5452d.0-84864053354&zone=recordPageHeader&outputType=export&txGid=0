From the design of the infrastructure to the design of the buildings, from transportation to industry, there are lots that can be done to make a city better suited to sustainability. Yet, questions like ""Is renovating a fossil city the way to go?"" or ""How much can be done to make a present city more sustainable?"" need to be answered. The answers will be searched by selecting and examining cities around the world and in Turkey, in terms of selected indicators of sustainability in city scale. Consequently, the selected cities will be compared.
