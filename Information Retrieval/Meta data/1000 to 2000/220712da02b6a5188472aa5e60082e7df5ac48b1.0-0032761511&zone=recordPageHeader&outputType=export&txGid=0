In particular the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle obtains more energy, and a tendency toward cold events can be observed. These statistical changes are superimposed on an overall warming trend. It is suggested that this information can be used in order to refine climate change detection via the optimal fingerprinting strategy. An optimal spectral fingerprint is developed on the basis of linear perturbation theory of wavelet variances. In order to elucidate the potential of higher-order statistical moments in the climate change detection context the optimal spectral fingerprint technique is applied to the ECHAM4/OPYC greenhouse warming simulation. The results provide a rough estimate of the timescale over which human-caused changes in the statistics of ENSO can be expected to exceed the level of natural variability. These results reveal in particular that recent observed changes of ENSO variability are consistent with the null hypothesis of natural climate variability. Furthermore, an information theoretical approach is adopted to investigate possible influences of global warming on ENSO predictability. © 1999 American Meteorological Society.",,"Computer simulation; Drought; Perturbation techniques; Statistical methods; El Nino southern oscillation; Greenhouse warming; Higher order statistical moments; Linear perturbation theory; Nonstationary response; Optimal spectral fingerprint; Global warming; climate change; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; greenhouse effect",,,,,,"Bacher, A., Oberhuber, J.M., Roeckner, E., ENSO dynamics and seasonal cycle in the tropical Pacific as simulated by the ECHAM4/OPYC3 coupled general circulation model (1997) Climate Dyn., 14, pp. 431-450; Barnett, T.P., Detection of changes in global tropospheric temperature field induced by greenhouse gases (1986) J.
