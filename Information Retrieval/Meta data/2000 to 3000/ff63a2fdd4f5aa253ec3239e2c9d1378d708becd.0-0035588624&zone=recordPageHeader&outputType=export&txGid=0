Tlmt is, the problem of global ivarming itill be looked at in a comprehensive study considering several aspects of the cosmos, tlie Earth, and the phenomenon of life. With such a broad understanding in mind, first analyzes both the disadvantageous and advantageous aspects of the current global tcarming. Second, compares three typical environmental conditions in which humans have lived. Third, employing the concept of global warming, looks at tlie myth of how ancient civilizations appeared and disappeared. Then, considering our Earth system as an open system travelling in the universe, provides an explanation for the current global wanning and for global climate changes. It is expected tliat the explanation presented can be applied to produce long-term predictions for climate changes. © MCB University Press,.","Civilization; Cybernetics; Environment; Global warming; Green issues; Systems","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer systems; Cybernetics; Disasters; Earth atmosphere; Ecology; Environmental protection; Meteorology; Temperature scales; Atmospheric dynamics; Civilization; Environment; Green issues; Global warming",,,,,,"An, Z.S., Wu, X.H., Antient Chinese Environmental Changes in the Last 18,000 Years (1990) Progresses in Natural Sdences, 2, pp. 167-173; Clayton, A., Radcliffe, N.J., (1996) Siistainability: A Systems Approach, , Westview Press, Boulder, CO; Co, J.Z., (1996) Several Progresses and Trends in the Research of Atmospheric Dynamics"", the Frontiers and Future of the Modem Atmospheric Sciences, Press of Meteorology, Beijing, pp. 71-75; Ding, Y.H., ""The main scientific achievements and questions contained in the second IPCC scientific assessment report on climate changes"" (1997) Studies on Climate Changes and Effects in China, pp. 21-25. , in Ding, Y.H. and Shi, G.S.
