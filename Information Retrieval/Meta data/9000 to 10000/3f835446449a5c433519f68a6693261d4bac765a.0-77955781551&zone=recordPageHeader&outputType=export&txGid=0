The defenses code against typhoon attacks for nuclear power plant should be calibrated because of the increasing threat of typhoon disaster and severe consequences. This paper discusses the probabilistic approach of definitions about probable maximum typhoon and probable maximum storm surge in nuclear safety regulations of China and has made some design code calibrations by use of a newly proposed Double Layer Nested Multi-objective Probability Model (DLNMPM). ©2010 Chinese Ocean Engineering Society.","Coastal engineering; Code calibration; Double layer nested multi-objective probability model; Nuclear power plant; Typhoon","Coastal defense; Code calibration; Design codes; Double layers; Multi objective; Nuclear power; Nuclear safety regulation; Probabilistic approaches; Storm surges; Typhoon; Calibration; Coastal engineering; Global warming; Laws and legislation; Multiobjective optimization; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Probability; Sea level; Hurricanes",,,,,,"History of lake pontchartrain and vincinity hurricane protection project (2005), pp. 1-4. , Army Corps of Engineers, U.
