Predictio, Camp Springs, MD 20746, United States","The orbital drift of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-7, -9, -11, -14 series of satellites results in a significant cooling effect on their afternoon path Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) land surface skin temperature (Ts) measurements. This effect mixes with the signal of true variations in the climate system, and thus prevents Ts from being directly used in climate change and global warming studies. This paper applies a physically based 'typical pattern technique' to remove the orbit drift effect from Ts. The technique utilizes a lookup table of representative land skin temperature diurnal cycles derived from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate Community Model (CCM3) coupled with the land surface model, Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS). The generated typical patterns of Ts diurnal cycle are functions of vegetation type, season and latitude, and are combined with satellite observations to remove the cooling effect. Applying this methodology to eighteen years of AVHRR (1981-1998) Ts observations yields an improved skin temperature dataset. Analysis of the drift-corrected skin temperature illustrates a warming trend at the surface over the past two decades, a result which agrees well with the observed surface air temperature trend. A discussion of uncertainties in this technique is also presented.",,"Climatology; Global warming; Satellite observatories; Surface properties; Temperature measurement; Vegetation; Drift-corrected skin temperature; Remote sensing; AVHRR; diurnal variation; error correction; land surface; remote sensing; satellite imagery; surface temperature",,,,,,"Agbu, P.A., James, M.E., (1994) The NOAA/NASA Pathfinder AVHRR Land Data Set Users Manual, , Greenbelt, MD: Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center; Dai, A., Trenberth, K.E., Karl, T.R., Effects of clouds, soil moisture, precipitation, and water vapor on diurnal temperature range (1999) Journal of Climate, 12, pp. 2451-2473; Defries, R.S., Hansen, M., Townshend, J.R.G., Sohlberg, R., Global land cover classification at 8 km spatial resolution: The use of training data derived from Landsat imagery in decision tree classifiers (1998) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 19, pp. 3141-33168; Dickinson, R.E., Henderson-Sellers, A., Kennedy, P.J., (1993) Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) Version IE As Coupled to the NCAR Community Climate Model, p. 72. , NCAR Tech.
