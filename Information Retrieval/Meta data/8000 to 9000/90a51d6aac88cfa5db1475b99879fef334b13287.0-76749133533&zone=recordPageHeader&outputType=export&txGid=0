The computational efficiency is achieved by reformulating of the heat transfer problem as a set of ordinary differential equations for evolution of the temperature wave inside the upper sediment layer. Arising temperature and depth scales completely replace the conductivity of the sediment in the heat transfer equation and can be easily achieved from the lake water temperature observations without any data on the sediment thermal properties. The method is proposed for the scales estimation from the inverse solution of the model equations in special case of the constant water-sediment heat flux in ice-covered lakes. The method is tested on data from sediments of Lake Krasnoye, North-Western Russia. The long-term (1961-2002) modeling of temperature in German lakes Müggelsee and Heiligensee with a coupled one-dimensional model of lake water column and sediments has demonstrated an appreciable effect of the sediment heat storage on near-bottom temperatures in both lakes. Thus, incorporation of the sediment layer into lake temperature models can essentially improve, at low computational costs, the model performance, especially for shallow lakes. In addition, a better forecast of near-bottom temperature evolution on climatic scales can provide a better understanding of the response of lake benthic communities to global warming. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
