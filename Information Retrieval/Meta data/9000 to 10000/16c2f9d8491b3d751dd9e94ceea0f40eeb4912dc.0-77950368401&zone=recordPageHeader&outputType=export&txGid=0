SIWMS provides a detailed view of the environmental impacts and associated costs of municipal solid waste (MSW) management alternatives under conditions of uncertainty. The model follows a life-cycle inventory approach extended with compensatory systems to provide more equitable bases for comparing different alternatives. Economic performance is measured by the net present value. The model is verified against four publicly available models under deterministic conditions and then used to study the impact of uncertainty on Sydney's MSW management 'best practices'. Uncertainty has a significant effect on all impact categories. The greatest effect is observed in the global warming category where a reversal of impact direction is predicted. The reliability of the system is most sensitive to uncertainties in the waste processing and disposal. The results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty at all stages to better understand the behaviour of the MSW system. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Associated costs; Best practice; Economic performance; Integrated waste management; Life Cycle Inventory; Life-cycle assessments; Municipal solid waste; Municipal solid waste management; Net present value; Waste processing; Global warming; Life cycle; Solid wastes; Stochastic models; Waste disposal; Environmental impact; best management practice; computer simulation; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; uncertainty analysis; waste disposal; waste management; acidification; anaerobic digestion; article; biodegradation; calorimetry; chemical composition; controlled study; decision support system; economic evaluation; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; incineration; intermethod comparison; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; process development; process model; recycling; reliability; sensitivity analysis; solid waste management; statistical analysis; stochastic model; uncertainty; validation process; waste disposal; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Incineration; Models, Theoretical; New South Wales; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Stochastic Processes; Uncertainty; Waste Management",,"Soil",,,,"Amlinger, F., Peyr, S., Cuhls, C., Green house gas emissions from composting and mechanical biological treatment (2008) Waste Management and Research, 26, pp. 47-60; Arrena, U., Mastellone, M.L., Perugini, F., The environmental performance of alternative solid waste management options: a life cycle assessment study (2003) Chemical Engineering Journal, 96, pp. 207-222; Bingemer, H.G., Crutzen, P.J., The production of methane from solid waste (1987) Journal of Geophysical Research, 92, pp. 2181-2187; Chang, N.B., Wang, S.F., The development of a decision support system for municipal solid waste management (1996) Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 20, pp. 201-212; Dalemo, M., Sonesson, U., Björklund, A., Mingarini, K., Frostell, B., Jönsson, H., Nybrant, T., Thyselius, L., ORWARE - a simulation model for organic waste handling systems.
