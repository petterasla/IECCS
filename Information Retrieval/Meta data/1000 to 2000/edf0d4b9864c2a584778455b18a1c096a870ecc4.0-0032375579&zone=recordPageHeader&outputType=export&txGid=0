The fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have the potential to compete with the petroleum-fueled internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in cost and performance while effectively addressing air quality, energy insecurity, and global warming concerns. Methanol being a liquid can be easily transported and can be supplied from the existing network of oil company distribution sites. Recently, combining improved catalysts with fuel cell engineering, it has been possible to overcome some of the difficulties that have frustrated previous research and development efforts in realizing a commercially viable direct methanol fuel cell. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMPCs) with power densities between 0.2 and 0.4 W/cm2 at operational temperatures in the range 95-130 °C have been developed. These power densities are sufficient to suggest that stack construction is well worth while. This paper reviews recent advances and technical challenges in the field of DMFCs.","Direct methanol fuel cell; Fuel cell; Methanol; Nafion; Vehicle",,,,,,,"Williams, R.H., Larson, E.D., Katofsky, R.E., Chen, J., (1995) Energy for Sustainable Development, 1, p. 18; Liebhafsky, H.A., Cairns, E.J., (1968) Fuel Cells and Fuel Batteries - A Guide to Their Research and Development, , Wiley, New York; Appleby, A.J., Foulkes, F.R., (1989) Fuel Cell HandBook, , Von Nostrand Reinhold, New York; Appleby, A.J., (1995) Encyclopedia of Energy Technology and the Environment, 2. , Bisic A, Boots S (eds) Wiley, New York; Berger, C., (1968) Handbook of Fuel Cell Technology, , Prentice-Hall, Engelwood Cliffs, New Jersey; Vielstich, W., (1970) Fuel Cells, Translated into English, , Wiley-Interscience, London; Murphy, O.J., Hitchens, G.D., Manko, D.J., (1994) J Power Sources, 47, p. 353; Prater, K.B., (1994) J Power Sources, 51, p. 129; Bockris, J.O'M., Srinivasan, S., (1969) Fuel Cells: Their Electrochemistry.
