The simulated results were compared with that of the present climate, to assess the sensitivity of maize to climatic change. The analysis indicated that soil moisture is sensitive to reduced precipitation, maize development is sensitive to the rise of temperature, and maize growth is affected greatly by temperature elevation and precipitation variation, which cancel out the positive effects of CO2 elevation. It was found that with the severe change of climate, the leaf biomass, the female fringe biomass, and the leaf area index would decline greatly, and the biomass of stem and root would increase greatly. The average yield of maize will decline between 5% and 30%.","Global climate change; Maize growth; Physiological ecology model","agricultural modeling; climate change; ecophysiology; growth response; maize; China",,,,,,"Houghton, T.T., Callander, B.A., Varnesy, S.K., (1992) Climate Change: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Wang, S.-W., Diagnostic studies on the climate change and variability for the period of 1880-1990 (1994) Acta Meteorol Sin, 52, pp. 262-273. , in Chinese; (1990) Scientific Assessment of Climate Change, , Cambridge: Cambridge University; (1992) Climate Change: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge: Cambridge University; Coleman, J.S., Atmosphere CO2, plant nitrogen status and susceptibility of plants to an acute increase in temperature (1994) Plant Cell Environ, 14, pp. 667-674; Wang, C.-Y., A diagnostic experiment of the influence of CO2 on winter wheat (1995) J Environ Sci, 7, pp. 167-175; Wang, C.-Y., A diagnostic experiment of the influence of CO2 on cotton (1995) Acta Meteorol Sin, 9, pp. 501-508. , in Chinese; Wang, C.-Y., Pan, Y.-R., Bai, Y.-M., Wen, M., The experiment study of effects doubled CO2 concentration on several main crops in China (1997) Acta Meteorol Sin, 55, pp. 86-94. , in Chinese; Guo, J.-P., Gao, S.-H., Bai, Y.-M., Wen, M., Wang, C.-Y., A study of impart of CO2 concentration doubling on soybean leaf development and biomass (1995) Quart J Appl Meteorol, 6 (SUPPL.), pp. 62-68. , in Chinese; Zuo, B., Jiang, G., Bai, K., Kuang, T., Effect of elevated CO2 concentration on the conformation of thylakoid membranes and on starch accumulation in chloroplasts from leaves of different crops (1995) Photosythesis from Light to Biosphere, 5, pp. 909-912. , Mathis P.
