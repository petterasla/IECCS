This paper simulates two energy futures for Central America as a region: a minimum cost (maximum development) scenario and a minimum CO2 emissions scenario. The tradeoffs between these two scenarios identify a frontier demonstrating the costs of cutting carbon emissions in Central America. As these costs are relatively low, Central America can use them to negotiate treaties, agreements, and eventually the sale of carbon emission rights to countries or companies facing more expensive carbon reduction strategies. © 1992.","Carbon emissions; Central America; Energy development","air pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide emissions; developing country; economic growth; emission scenario; energy development; environmental protection; global warming; international cooperation; pollution problem; regional cooperation; Central America",,,,,,"World Bank, (1989) Trends in Developing Economies: 1989, , World Bank, Washington, DC, USA; Trocki, La Situacion Energetica en Cinco Paises Centroamericanos (1988) Los Alamos National Laboratory LA-10988-MS, , Los Alamos Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA; Leonard, (1987) Natural Resources and Economic Development in Central America: A Regional Environmental Profile, , Transaction Books, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; Kasperson, Developmental and geographical equity in global environmental change: a framework for analysis (1989) Seminar Presentation, , University of Pennsylvania PARSS Risk and the Environment, PN, USA; Strout first drew attention to this in an article analysing energy demand growth throughout Central America.

Woodfuel prices will increase as the more accessible supplies are exhausted and the less-accessible supplies are utilized. The petroleum price increase (3.5%) is based on the intermediate-price increase forecast in the US Department of Energy (DOE), Annual Outlook on Energy, 1990, DOE-EIA-0383-(90), Energy Information Administration, Wasington, DC, USA, 1990, p 7The primary energy supply mix is taken to give a more accurate representation of total energy requirements than just end-use accounts. This is particularly important in the context of thermal electricity generationThe shadow price of supplying the transport sector is nearly $400, nearly eight times greater than the projected price of gasolineBarbier, Pearce, Thinking economically about climate change (1990) Energy Policy, 18 (1), pp. 11-18; For the analysis in the following paragraphs, no discounting of carbon emissions has been undertaken. That is to say, carbon emissions through time have been accumulated with no time preference even though in real life, the delaying of carbon emissions may have certain benefitsWeiss, Jr, Can market mechanism ameliorate the effects of long-term climate change? (1989) Climatic Change, 15, pp. 299-308; Nordhaus reviews the major studies which have been used to estimate the costs of reducing carbon emissions. In his assessment of the afforestation option, he uses a cost of capital equivalent to 6%.

For example, Costa Rica and Honduras would serve as the electricity exporters while El Salvador might serve as a logical base for improved refinery operations.
