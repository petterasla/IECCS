One fifths died from the combination of dehydration, heatstroke, and hyperthermia and one tenth from dehydration, despite abundant water. Methods and Results: We hypothesized that physiologic adaptation to heat was not effective in the victims attributable to side-effects of drugs (impaired thermoregulation, suppressed thirst) many of these patients were taking. This could explain why many victims died of dehydration despite availability of water. As a consequence of the global climate change heatwaves may occur more frequently and may be more intense, with a strong impact on the future selection of drugs in elderly patients. Conclusion: Insufficient water intake, impaired thermoregulation, and resulting death may be directly linked to the use of certain drugs, implying an immediate need for public awareness during heatwaves and for long-term strategies to mitigate the expected increase in future heatwave-related fatalities. © 2009 EFNS.","Adaptation; Climate change; Drugs; Environmental health; Extreme weather; Global warming; Heatwave; Side-effects; Thermoregulation; Thirst","adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist; anticonvulsive agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biperiden; carbamazepine; Chinese drug; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; clozapine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; disopyramide; ergot derivative; herbaceous agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; mecamylamine; muscle relaxant agent; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; oxybutynin; pizotifen; risperidone; serotonin agonist; tolterodine; tricyclic antidepressant agent; trihexyphenidyl; triptan derivative; tropatepine; trospium chloride; unindexed drug; valproic acid; article; cause of death; climate change; dehydration; electrolyte disturbance; fatality; fluid intake; heat acclimatization; heat stroke; heat tolerance; high risk population; human; hyponatremia; nonhuman; polydipsia; priority journal; side effect; sweating; thermoregulation; thirst; vasodilatation; victim; Body Temperature Regulation; Cause of Death; Climate; Dehydration; Heat Stress Disorders; Humans; Hypothermia, Induced; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Thirst",,"biperiden, 1235-82-1, 514-65-8; carbamazepine, 298-46-4, 8047-84-5; clozapine, 5786-21-0; disopyramide, 3737-09-5; mecamylamine, 60-40-2, 826-39-1; muscle relaxant agent, 9008-44-0; olanzapine, 132539-06-1; oxybutynin, 119618-22-3, 1508-65-2, 5633-20-5; pizotifen, 15574-96-6; risperidone, 106266-06-2; tolterodine, 124937-51-5; trihexyphenidyl, 144-11-6, 52-49-3; tropatepine, 27574-24-9; trospium chloride, 10405-02-4; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1",,,,"Fouillet, A., Rey, G., Laurent, F., Pavillon, G., Bellec, S., Guihenneuc-Jouyaux, C., Clavel, J., Hemon, D., Excess mortality related to the August 2003 heat wave in France (2006) International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 80 (1), pp. 16-24. , DOI 10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4; McMichael, A.J., Woodruff, R.E., Hales, S., Climate change and human health: Present and future risks (2006) Lancet, 367 (9513), pp. 859-869. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68079-3, PII S0140673606680793; Mekjavic, I.B., Eiken, O., Contribution of thermal and nonthermal factors to the regulation of body temperature in humans (2006) Journal of Applied Physiology, 100 (6), pp. 2065-2072. , http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/100/6/2065, DOI 10.1152/japplphysiol.01118.2005; Mise Au Point sur le Bon Usage des Medicaments en Cas de Vague de Chaleur, , http://agmed.sante.bouv.fr/htm/10/, AFSSaPS.
