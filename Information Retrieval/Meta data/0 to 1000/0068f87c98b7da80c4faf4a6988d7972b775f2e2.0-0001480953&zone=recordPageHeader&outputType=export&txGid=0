We manipulated the thermal regime of a stream and analyzed the population genetics of constituent species to examine the effects of global warming on stream invertebrates. 2. 2. Increased temperature resulted in significantly lower total densities of invertebrates and altered growth patterns for two target species. 3. 3. Hyalella azteca showed the greatest change in growth and also exhibited high levels of genetic differentiation among populations. Nemoura trispinosa showed only small shifts in growth and phenology and exhibited little genetic differentiation among populations. 4. 4. The poteintial impacts of global warming may depend critically on the dispersal abilities and genetic structure of lotic populations. © 1995.",,,,,,,,"Atkinson, Temperature and organism size—a biological law for ectotherms?
