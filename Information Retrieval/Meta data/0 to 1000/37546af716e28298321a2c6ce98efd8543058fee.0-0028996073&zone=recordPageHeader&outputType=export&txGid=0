Previously proposed international policy instruments, such as country by country targets, carbon taxes, and tradable permits, face major difficulties as stand alone proposals. The key element of the regime proposed here is to combine annual tradable permits which are allocated based on population in a fixed year with a small carbon tax ($5-10/tonne) on emissions in excess of permits. Both permits and carbon taxes are applied to national level governments, which in turn would use whatever mix of policies desired to reduce national emissions. It is suggested that the initial number of permits correspond to total global emissions in the base year; over time, the number of permits could be reduced and the tax rate increased if improved scientific knowledge so dictates. By allocating permits based on population the equity concerns of developing countries are addressed, while taxing emissions in excess of permit holdings removes the rigidity of a quota system and limits resource transfers by effectively capping the permit trading price, which is a major concern of industrialized countries. To accommodate the difficulties of countries which have not yet achieved the demographic transition, the permit allocation scheme could be subject to a one-time adjustment after 10-15 years based on some weighting of the initial and then-current populations. The proposed scheme is based on the premise that there is a large potential for reducing emissions in developed countries or limiting emission increases in developing countries, and the intention is to create competition between national level governments in implementing cost-effective emission reduction. © 1995.",,"carbon dioxide emissions reduction;

Dickinson, Kennedy, Impacts on regional climate of Amazon deforestation (1992) Geophysical Research Letters, 19, pp. 1947-1950. , For deforestation in the Amazon, compute a surface albedo (reflectivity) increase of 0.07, which causes a decrease in absorbed solar radiation of 16 W/m2, and a reduction in cloud cover giving an increase in solar radiation absorbed at the surface by 13 W/ m2, for a net decrease in solar radiation absorbed at the surface of 3 W/m2. The decrease in cloudiness would reduce absorption of solar radiation in the atmosphere by a further 1–2 W/m2, for a total reduction in the absorption of solar radiation of 4–5 W/m2. Reforestation of 1 million km2 of tropical forest at a carbon density of 150 tonnes/ha would sequester 15 Gt C and reduce greenhouse heating by 0.124 W/m2. Assuming, as an approximation, that the reverse albedo and cloud changes would occur with reforestation as for deforestation, the reduction of surface albedo would [[Truncated]]; Such measures, to the extent that they improve standards of living, will also tend to reduce long-term population growth rates and thus indirectly lead to lower future greenhouse gas emissionsWorld Bank, (1984) World Development Report, p. 286. , See, Oxford University Press, on the relationship between development and population growth rates; Grubb, Sebenius, Participation, allocation and adaptability in international tradable emission permit systems for greenhouse gas control (1992) Proceedings OECD workshop on tradable emission permits to reduce greenhouse gas, , This concern was raised by, Paris; (1992) Climate Change Policy Initiatives, pp. 92-93. , Inter-national Energy Agency, Paris, The clearing house would receive project proposals from countries with opportunities to inexpensively reduce emissions compared to their agreed limit, would evaluate their effect on greenhouse gas emissions, and would link the projects to investment funding from those countries willing to meet part of their emission reduction commitment outside their borders; (1994) Global Climate Change Digest, 7 (6), p. 17; The argument for including all major greenhouse gases in an emission trading scheme or in a single target for overall raiative heating is that it would allow different states to concentrate on reducing emissions of those greenhouse gases whose emissions (and associated heating impact) could be reduced at the lowest costGrubb, Victor, Hope, Pragmatics in the greenhouse (1991) Nature, 354, pp. 348-350. , However, as discussed by, the extra growth in CO2 emissions that can be bought by increasingly stringent controls in CH4 is limited and subject to diminishing returns, while exponential growth in CH4 emissions cannot continue no matter how much CO2 emissions are restricted if global warming is to be limited to 2.5 °C to 4 °C; Harvey, A guide to global warming potentials (1993) Energy Policy, 21, pp. 24-34. , Furthermore, as discussed by, some of the most economically attractive measures to reduce fossil fuel CO2 emissions by switching from coal to natural gas also reduce CH4 emissions, so that simultaneous reductions in both greenhouse gases can be achieved; Recycling the proceeds of the tax back to countries paying the tax would reduce any negative economic impacts of the tax, although for a small tax these impacts would be negligible. Indeed, the tax could be used to increase long-term economic productivity through strategic reinvestment in energy efficient technologies and infrastructure. Net transfers to developing countries would then occur only through sale of tradable permits. Since governments would prefer paying a tax they get back rather than buying permits, the market price of permits would drop below the tax rate in this case. If, on the other hand, the tax revenues are redistributed based on population, this should be done based on population in a fixed year, as in the yearly permit allocation. Even in this case, some of the tax revenues would flow back to developed countries through the purchase of energy efficient technologies and expertise from developed countriesUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) (1992) Agenda 21, , Article 33.15; United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) (1992) Agenda 21, , Article 9.33; Studies by the OECD and World Bank indicate that the fossil fuel subsidy in non-OECD countries averages $92/tonne carbonGrubb, Edmonds, ten Brink, Morrison, The costs of limiting fossil fuel CO2 emissions: A survey and analysis (1993) Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 18, pp. 397-478. , see; Harvey, Review of “Buying Greenhouse Insurance: The Economic Costs of CO2 Emission Reduction” by A S Manne and R Richels (1994) Climatic Change, 28, pp. 405-410; Harvey, Local actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the context of national action plans (1994) National Action to Mitigate Global Climate Change, Proceedings, , Copenhagen, The latter reference discusses innovative concepts to reduce transaction costs and other barriers to energy efficiency improvements as part of comprehensive, city wide building energy and water retrofit programme planned by the City of Toronto; Geller, Establishing an international energy efficiency agency — a response to the threat of global climate change (1991) Energy Policy, 19, pp. 689-695; Chayes, Skolnikoff, Core instututional arrangements for a global climate change regime (1992) presented to the Bellagio Conference; Victor, Chayes, Skolnikoff, Pragmatic approaches to regime building for complex international problems (1992) Global Change: Environmental Challenges and International Responses, pp. 453-474. , N Choucri, MIT Press; Jordon, Paying the incremental costs of global environmental protection The evolving role of GEF (1994) Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, 36, pp. 12-20; Jordon, Paying the incremental costs of global environmental protection: The evolving role of GEF (1994) Environment, 36, pp. 31-36; Harvey, Solar-hydrogen electricity generation in the context of global CO2 emission reducti (1995) Climatic Change, 29, pp. 53-89. , For a discussion of fuel cells and other advanced technologies, see; J Goldemberg, T B Johansson, A K N Reddy and R H Williams, Energy for a Sustainable World, Wiley, New Dehli, p 137J Goldemberg, T B Johansson, A K N Reddy and R H Williams, Energy for a Sustainable World, Wiley, New Dehli, p 142–146For a discussion of the role of side payments (or 'selective incentives') in past international environmental agreementsSand, Lessons learned in global environmental governance (1991) Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review, 18, pp. 213-277. , see; Pearce, Economics and the global environmental challenge (1990) Millennium - Journal of International Studies, 19, pp. 365-387. , For example; Given that fertility levels are below the replacement level in many OECD countries, an eventual population decline would occur in the absence of immigration(1990) Future Demographic Trends in Europe and North America: What Can we Assume Today?, p. 585. , International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenberg, See; Sebenius, Designing negotiations toward a new regime The case of global warming (1991) International Security, 15, pp. 110-148. , for an exposition of the need for built-in ratcheting mechanisms","Harvey, L.D.; The author is with the Department of Geography, University of Toronto, 100 St George Street, Toronto, M5S 1A1, Canada",,,,,,,,09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.
