The evidence from daily time series studies is scarce and inconsistent. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of high environmental temperatures on hospital admissions during April to September in 12 European cities participating in the Assessment and Prevention of Acute Health Effects of Weather Conditions in Europe (PHEWE) project. Methods: For each city, time series analysis was used to model the relationship between maximum apparent temperature (lag 0-3 days) and daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory causes by age (all ages, 65-74 age group, and 75+ age group), and the city-specific estimates were pooled for two geographical groupings of cities. Measurements and Main Results: For respiratory admissions, there was a positive association that was heterogeneous between cities. For a 1̊C increase in maximum apparent temperature above a threshold, respiratory admissions increased by +4.5% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-7.3) and +3.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.8-5.5) in the 751 age group in Mediterranean and North-Continental cities, respectively. In contrast, the association between temperature and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular admissions tended to be negative and did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: High temperatures have a specific impact on respiratory admissions, particularly in the elderly population, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Why high temperature increases cardiovascular mortality but not cardiovascular admissions is also unclear. The impact of extreme heat events on respiratory admissions is expected to increase in European cities as a result of global warming and progressive population aging.","Cardiovascular diseases; Elderly; Heat; Hospital admissions; Respiratory diseases","aged; article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; climate change; controlled study; environmental temperature; Europe; geographic distribution; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; mortality; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; adolescent; adult; age; air pollutant; child; clinical trial; Europe; female; health; heat; hospital admission; infant; male; middle aged; morbidity; multicenter study; newborn; Poisson distribution; preschool child; statistics; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Child; Child, Preschool; Europe; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Patient Admission; Poisson Distribution; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Urban Health; Young Adult",,"Air Pollutants",,,,"Climate change 2007: The physical science basis (2007) Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press;; Basu, R., Samet, J., Relation between elevated ambient temperature and mortality: A review of the epidemiologic evidence (2002) Epidemiol Rev, 24, pp. 190-202; Semenza, J.C., McCullough, J.E., Flanders, W.D., McGeehin, M.A., Lumpkin, J.R., Excess hospital admissions during the July 1995 heat wave in Chicago (1999) Am J Prev Med, 16, pp. 359-360; Kovats, S.R., Hajat, S., Wilkinson, P., Contrasting patterns of mortality and hospital admissions during hot weather and heat waves in Greater London, UK (2004) J Occup Environ Med, 61, pp. 893-898; Schwartz, J., Samet, J., Patz, J., Hospital admissions for heart disease: The effects of temperature and humidity (2004) Epidemiology, 15, pp. 755-761; Koken, P.J.M., Piver, W.T., Ye, F., Elixhauser, A., Olsen, L.M., Portier, C.J., Temperature, air pollution, and hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases among elderly people in Denver (2003) Environ Health Perspect, 111, pp. 1312-1317; Linares, C., Díaz, J., Impact of high temperatures on hospital admissions: Comparative analysis with previous studies about mortality (Madrid) (2008) Eur J Public Health, 18, pp. 317-322; Michelozzi, P., Kirchmayer, U., Katsouyanni, K., Biggeri, A., McGregor, G., Menne, B., Kassomenos, P., Accetta, G., Assessment and prevention of acute health effects of weather conditions in Europe, the PHEWE project: Background, objectives, design (2007) Environ Health, 6, p. 12; Kenney, W.L., Munce, T.A., Invited review: Aging and human temperature regulation (2003) J Appl Physiol, 95, pp. 2598-2603; Baccini, M., Biggeri, A., Accetta, G., Kosatsky, T., Katsouyanni, K., Analitis, A., Anderson, H.R., D'Ippoliti, D., Effects of apparent temperature on summer mortality in 15 European cities: Results of the PHEWE project (2008) Epidemiology, 19, pp. 711-719; Kalkstein, L.S., Valimont, K.M., An evaluation of summer discomfort in the United States using a relative climatological index (1986) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 67, pp. 842-848; O'Neill, M.S., Zanobetti, A., Schwartz, J., Modifiers of the temperature and mortality association in seven US cities (2003) Am J Epidemiol, 157, pp. 1074-1082; Liang, K.-Y., Zeger, S.L., Longitudinal analysis using generalized linear models (1986) Biometrika, 73, pp. 13-22; Chiogna, M., Gaetan, C., Transfer function modelling strategy for combining evidence on air pollution and daily mortality (2003) Proceedings of SCO2003, Treviso.
