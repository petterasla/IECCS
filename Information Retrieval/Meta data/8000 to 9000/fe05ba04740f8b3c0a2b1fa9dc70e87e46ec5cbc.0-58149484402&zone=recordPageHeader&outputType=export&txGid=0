However, there is a large amount of uncertainty in the future climate predictions used for these studies. Specifically, the climate predictions can be very different based on a variety of global climate models and alternative greenhouse emission scenarios. In this study, we coupled a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and a forest process model, PnET-II, to examine the uncertainty (that results from the uncertainty in the future climate predictions) in the forest-type composition prediction for a transitional forest landscape [the Boundary Water Canoe Area]. Using an improved global-sensitivity analysis technique [Fourier amplitude sensitivity test], we also quantified the amount of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction contributed by different climate variables including temperature, CO2, precipitation and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). The forest landscape response was simulated for the period 2000-2400 ad based on the differential responses of 13 tree species under an ensemble of 27 possible climate prediction profiles (monthly time series of climate variables). Our simulations indicate that the uncertainty in the forest-type composition becomes very high after 2200 ad, which is close to the time when the current forests are largely removed by windthrow disturbances and natural mortality. The most important source of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction is from the uncertainty in temperature predictions. The second most important source is PAR, the third is CO2 and the least important is precipitation. Our results also show that if the optimum photosynthetic temperature rises due to CO2 enrichment, the forest landscape response to climatic change measured by forest-type composition may be substantially reduced. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Boundary water canoe area; Forest landscape; Global climatic change; LANDIS-II; PnET-II; Sensitivity; Uncertainty","carbon emission; climate change; global change; global warming; greenhouse gas; photosynthetically active radiation; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,"Aber, J.D., Federer, C.A., A generalized, lumped-parameter model of photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and net primary production in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems (1992) Oecologia, 92, pp. 463-474; Aber, J.D., Ollinger, S.V., Federer, C.A., Predicting the effects of climate change on water yield and forest production in the Northeastern U.S (1995) Climate Research, 5, pp. 207-222; Baker, W.L., Landscape ecology and nature reserve design in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, Minnesota (1989) Ecology, 70, pp. 23-35; Baker, W.L., Effects of settlement and fire suppression on landscape structure (1992) Ecology, 73, pp. 1879-1887; Botkin, D.B., Janak, J.F., Wallis, J.R., Some ecological consequences of a computer model of forest growth (1972) Journal of Ecology, 60, pp. 849-873; Castro, J., Zamora, R., Hodar, J.A., Gomez, J.M., Seedling establishment of a boreal tree species (Pinus sylvestris) at its southernmost distribution limit: Consequences of being in a marginal Mediterranean habitat (2004) Journal of Ecology, 92, pp. 266-277; Cramer, W., Bondeau, A., Woodward, F.I., Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: Results from six dynamic global vegetation models (2001) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 357-373; Crosetto, M., Tarantola, S., Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis: Tools for GIS-based model implementation (2001) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 15, pp. 415-437; Cukier, R.I., Levine, H.B., Shuler, K.E., Nonlinear sensitivity analysis of multiparameter model systems (1978) Journal of Computational Physics, 26, pp. 1-42; Dale, V.H., Joyce, L.A., McNulty, S., Climate change and forest disturbances (2001) Bioscience, 51, pp. 723-734; Drake, B.G., GonzalezMeler, M.A., Long, S.P., More efficient plants: A consequence of rising atmospheric CO2 ?
