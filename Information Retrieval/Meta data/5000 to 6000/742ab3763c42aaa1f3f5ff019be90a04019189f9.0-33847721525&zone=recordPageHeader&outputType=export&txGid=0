Regional differences in energy resources, growth in energy consumption, current technology diffusions, etc., should be considered in the assessments. A global energy systems model, DNE21+, with high regional resolution had treated the energy supply sectors in a bottom-up fashion and the end-use sectors in a top-down fashion, which was expressed by using long-term price elasticity. However, the assessments of technological options in the end-use sectors are currently more important, particularly for the near and middle terms. In order to evaluate the technological options not only in the energy supply sectors but also in the end-use sectors for energy savings and CO2 emission reductions, DNE21+ has been modified for treating two energy-intensive end-use sectors, i.e. steel and cement sectors, in the bottom-up fashion. The results reveal that the cost-effective global CO2 emission reductions in 2030 for stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 concentration at 550 ppmv in comparison with that in the reference case would be approximately 68 MtC/yr and almost zero in the steel and cement sectors, respectively. The cost-effective options include next-generation coke ovens and coke dry quenching (CDQ) in the steel sector. © 2007 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Cement sector; Energy saving; Energy systems model; Global warming mitigation; Iron and steel sector","Cement sector; Energy systems model; Global warming mitigation; Iron and steel sector; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Diffusion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Energy conservation",,,,,,"(2001) Steel Statistical, , http://www.worldsteel.org, IISI International Iron and Steel Institute, Yearbook; (2005) Global Cement Report (sixth edition), Global Cement Statistics 14 year Database, , ed, International Cement Review, Tradeship Publications Ltd, Surrey, United Kingdom; (2005) Can Transnational Sectoral Agreements Help Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions, , OECD, Round Table on Sustainable Development; Akimoto K, Homma T, Kosugi T, Li X, Tomoda T, Fujii Y.
