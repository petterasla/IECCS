This study was conducted to examine responses of plant N relationship (i.e. leaf N concentration, N use efficiency, and plant N content in this study) to a 4-year experimental warming in a tallgrass prairie in the central Great Plains in USA. We measured mass-based N and carbon (C) concentrations of stem, green, and senescent leaves, and calculated N resorption efficiency, N use efficiency, plant N content, and C:N ratios of five dominant species (two C4 grasses, one C3 grass, and two C3 forbs). The results showed that warming decreased N concentration of both green and senescent leaves, and N resorption efficiency for all species. N use efficiencies and C:N ratios were accordingly higher under warming than control. Total plant N content increased under warming because of warming-induced increases in biomass production that are larger than the warming-induced decreases in tissue N concentration. The increases in N contents in both green and senescent plant tissues suggest that warming enhanced both plant N uptake and return through litterfall in the tallgrass ecosystem. Our results also suggest that the increased N use efficiency in C4 grasses is a primary mechanism leading to increased biomass production under warming in the grassland ecosystem. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Global warming; N concentration; N resorption efficiency; N use efficiency; Tallgrass prairie","biomass; global warming; nitrogen; prairie; resorption; Poaceae",,,,,,"Anke, L., Wright, R.F., Experimentally increased soil temperature causes release of nitrogen at a boreal forest catchment in southern Norway (1997) Global Change Biology, 3, pp. 13-21; Arft, A.M., Walker, M.D., Gurevitch, J., Responses of tundra plants to experimental warming: Meta-analysis of the international tundra experiment (1999) Ecological Monographs, 6, pp. 491-511; Billings, S.A., Stephen, F.Z., Heather, W., Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on green leaf tissue and leaf litter quality in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 729-735; Cox, P.M., Betts, R.A., Jones, C.D., Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 186-187; Del, A., Escudero, A., Garrido, J.M., Effects of site characteristics on nitrogen retranslocation from senescing leaves (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 701-708; Escudero, A., Del, A., Garrido, J.M., Effects of leaf longevity and translocation efficiency on retention time of nutrients in the leaf biomass of different wood species (1992) Oecologia, 90, pp. 80-87; Grogan, P., Chapin III, F.S., Initial effects of experimental warming on above- and belowground components of net ecosystem CO2 exchange in arctic tundra (2000) Oecologia, 125, pp. 512-520; Hobbie, E.A., Olszyk, D.M., Rygiewicz, P.T., Foliar nitrogen concentrations and natural abundance of 15N suggest nitrogen allocation patterns of Douglas-fir and mycorrhizal fungi during development in elevated carbon dioxide concentration and temperature (2001) Tree Physiology, 21, pp. 1113-1122; Hungate, B.A., Dukes, J.S., Shaw, M.R., Nitrogen and climate change (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1512-1513; Ineson, P., Benham, D.G., Taylor, K., Effects of climate change on nitrogen dynamics in upland soils. 2.
