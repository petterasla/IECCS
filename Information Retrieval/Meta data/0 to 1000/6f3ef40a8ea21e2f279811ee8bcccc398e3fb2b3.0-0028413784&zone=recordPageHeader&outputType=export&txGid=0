The fuel is reformed into a mixture of hydrogen and CO2 before combustion takes place. These gases are subsequently separated by preferential absorption or by differential phase changes. Thereafter, hydrogen replaces the original fuel for power generation. The liquefied CO2 is discharged into the deep ocean. Water depths of about 500 m appear to be favorable from logistic and thermoeconomic standpoints. Calculations for a 500 MW methane power plant, retrofitted with the proposed system, indicate moderate power and cost penalties. The relative impact of a widespread implementation of this global warming countermeasure is assessed, and the advantages of moderate hydrocarbon consumption trends, as well as of high CO2 discharge fractions are highlighted. This latter point may indicate the need for sweeping changes, such as the establishment of hydrogen-based economies if global warming is to be avoided. © 1994.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Power plants; Reforming reactions; Deep ocean discharge; Differential phase change; Global warming; Precombustion reforming; Industrial emissions",,,,,,"Marchetti, On geoengineering and the CO2 problem (1977) Climatic Change, 1, pp. 59-68; Steinberg, Cheng, Horn, (1984) A systems study for the removal, recovery, and disposal of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power plants in the U.S. Informal Report BNL 35666, , Brookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island, NY; Golomb, Herzog, Tester, White, Zemba, Feasibility, modeling and economics of sequestering power plant CO2 emissions in the deep ocean (1989) Report MIT-EL-89-003, , 13th edition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; Mori, Masutani, Nihous, Vega, Kinoshita, A strategy for pre-combustion removal of carbon dioxide from hydrocarbon-fueled plants (1991) ASME National Heat Transfer Conf.
