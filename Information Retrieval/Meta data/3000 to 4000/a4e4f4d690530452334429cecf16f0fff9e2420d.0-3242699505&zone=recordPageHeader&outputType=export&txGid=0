The article builds on the premise that urban biodiversity exists at a crucial nexus of ecological and societal interactions, linking local, regional, and global scales, and that urban ecologies are projected to become even more dynamic in the future, particularly as a result of global climate change. The pathway proposed to reconcile the biodiversity-urban society relationships is the incorporation of biosphere reserve strategies into regional environmental planning efforts focused on the New York/New Jersey Harbor/Estuary specifically and on the greater New York Metropolitan Region in general. The concepts of the ""ecological footprint"" and vulnerability to global environmental change are used to analyze the current interactions between biodiversity and urban society, and to evaluate the efficacy of adopting biosphere reserve strategies in the region. New York has long been at the forefront of American environmentalism and landscape planning. Coupled with this history is a still small but growing interest in regional environmental planning efforts (e.g., the U.S. EPA Harbor Estuary Program) and green infrastructure (e.g., the 2002 Humane Metropolis Conference organized by the Ecological Cities Project). The research presented here aims to contribute to these nascent activities. As a megacity, New York may serve as a model for other major cities of the world.","Biosphere reserve; Ecological footprint; Environmental change; New York Metropolitan Region; Urban biodiversity","biodiversity; biosphere; climate change; community ecology; conference paper; environmental change; environmental planning; global climate; human; landscape; United States; urban area; City Planning; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment Design; Greenhouse Effect; New Jersey; New York; Waste Management; Malus x domestica; Nexus",,,,,,"Haughton, G., Hunter, C., (1994) Sustainable Cities, , Regional Studies Association.
