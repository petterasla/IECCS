The climate factors that are actually decisive, such as changes in solar energy, which have substantially characterized the temperatures prevailing on the earth and continue to determine them, cannot be controlled by man. Impacts introduced by anthropogenic influences, such as the input of climatically relevant gases into the atmosphere, represent the only possibility of intervention even though the effects of countermeasures on the climate are bound to remain slight. In view of the relatively minor effects that anthropogenic carbon dioxide has had, and will presumably continue to have, on the climate scenario it must be wondered whether the considerable effort expended on countermeasures is always justifiable from an economic point of view. In spite of this, the consumption of fossil fuels, and thus the emission of carbon dioxide, must be kept as low as possible for reasons of environmental protection and the preservation of raw materials. The BGR (Federal Institute for Geosciences and Raw Materials) suggests that these findings should be incorporated in the arguments put forward by policy makers when decisions on industrial development and global warming prevention are made, so that the dialogue between economic and ecological interests can yield sensible and environmentally compatible solutions at reasonable cost. The inclusion of, and even closer cooperation between, neo-climatology, which focuses on the more recent past, and palaeo-climate research, which applies geoscience to reconstruct climatological data, is creating an enhanced basis for future climate forecasts. Sudden and severe climate changes, the reasons for which have not been determined to date, are known to have occurred within one decade in prehistoric times. The justified question about forecasting short- and medium-term climate changes cannot yet be answered by reliable model predictions. In the long run, however, astronomic and geoscientific findings suggest a temperature drop over the next 10000 years.",,,,,,,,,"Berner, U.; Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe, Hannover, Germany",,,,,,,,09490205,,ZKGIF,,"German; English","ZKG Int",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-24044530487
