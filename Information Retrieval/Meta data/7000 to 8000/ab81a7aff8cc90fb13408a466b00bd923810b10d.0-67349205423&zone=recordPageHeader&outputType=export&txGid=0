In the global effort to combat the predicted disaster, several CO2 capture and storage technologies are being deliberated. One of the most promising biological carbon dioxide sequestration technologies is the enzyme catalyzed carbon dioxide sequestration into bicarbonates which was endeavored in this study with a purified C. freundii SW3 β-carbonic anhydrase (CA). An extensive screening process for biological sequestration using CA has been defined. Six bacteria with high CA activity were screened out of 102 colonies based on plate assay and presence of CA in these bacteria was further emphasized by activity staining and Western blot. The identity of selected bacteria was confirmed by 16S rDNA analysis. CA was purified to homogeneity from C. freundii SW3 by subsequent gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography which resulted in a 24 kDa polypeptide and this is in accordance with the Western blot results. The effect of host on metal ions, cations and anions which influence activity of the enzyme in sequestration studies suggests that mercury and HCO3 - ion almost completely inhibit the enzyme whereas sulfate ion and zinc enhances carbonic anhydrase activity. Calcium carbonate deposition was observed in calcium chloride solution saturated with carbon dioxide catalyzed by purified enzyme and whereas a sharp decrease in calcium carbonate formation has been noted in purified enzyme samples inhibited by EDTA and acetazolamide. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bacteria; Carbon sequestration; Carbonate deposition; Carbonic anhydrase; Enzyme purification","16S rDNA analysis; Atmospheric concentration; Calcium carbonate deposition; Calcium carbonate formation; Capture and storage technologies; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Carbon sequestration; Carbonate deposition; Carbonic anhydrase; Chloride solutions; Enzyme purification; Gel filtration; Ion exchange chromatography; Plate assay; Purified enzyme; Screening process; Sulfate ion; Western blots; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Calcium; Calcium alloys; Calcium chloride; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Carbonation; Chromatographic analysis; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Gelation; Global warming; Ion chromatography; Ion exchange; Mercury (metal); Metal ions; Metal refining; Zinc; Air purification; Bacteria (microorganisms); Citrobacter freundii",,,,,,"Bahn, Y.S., Cox, G.M., Perfect, J.R., Heitman, J., Carbonic anhydrase and CO2 sensing during Cryptococcus neoformans growth, differentiation, and virulence (2005) Curr Biol, 15, pp. 2013-2020. , 10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.047; Bertini, I., Canti, G., Luchinat, C., Scozzafava, A., Characterization of cobalt (II) bovine carbonic anhydrase and of its derivatives (1978) J Am Chem Soc, 100, pp. 4873-4877. , 10.1021/ja00483a038; Bertini, I., Luchinat, C., Monnanni, R., Roelens, S., Moratal, J.M., Interaction of carbon dioxide and copper (II) carbonic anhydrase (1987) J Am Chem Soc, 109 (25), pp. 7855-7856. , 10.1021/ja00259a038; Bond, G.M., Stringer, J., Brandvold, D.K., Simsek, F.A., Medina, M.G., Egeland, G., Development of integrated system for biomimetic CO2 sequestration using the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (2001) Energy Fuels, 15, pp. 309-316. , 10.1021/ef000246p; Druckenmiller, M.L., Maroto-Valer, M.M., Carbon sequestration using brines of adjusted pH to form mineral carbonates (2005) Fuel Process Technol, 86, pp. 1599-1614. , 10.1016/j.fuproc.2005.01.007; Fujikawa-Adachi, K., Nishimori, I., Taguchi, T., Onishi, S., Human carbonic anhydrase XIV (CA14): CDNA cloning, mRNA expression, and mapping to chromosome (1999) Genomics, 61, pp. 74-81. , 10.1006/geno.1999.5938; Ghoshal, D., Husic, H.D., Goyal, A., Dissolved inorganic carbon concentration mechanism in Chlamydomonas moewusii (2002) Plant Physiol Biochem, 40, pp. 299-305. , 10.1016/S0981-9428(02)01384-0; Heck, R.W., Tanhauser, S.M., Manda, R., Tu, C., Laipis, P.J., Silverman, D.N., Catalytic properties of mouse carbonic anhydrase V (1994) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 269 (40), pp. 24742-24746; Hou, W.-C., Chen, H.-J., Lin, Y.-H., Dioscorins from different Dioscorea species all exhibit both carbonic anhydrase and trypsin inhibitor activities (2000) Botanical Bulletin of Academia Sinica, 41 (3), pp. 191-196; Karlsson, J., Clarke, A.K., Chen, Z.Y., Hugghins, S.Y., Park, Y.I., Husic, H.D., Moroney, J.V., Samuelsson, G., A novel a-type carbonic anhydrase associated with the thylakoid membrane in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is required for growth at ambient CO2 (1998) EMBO J, 17 (5), pp. 1208-1216. , 10.1093/emboj/17.5.1208; Khalifah, R.G., The carbon dioxide hydration activity of carbonic anhydrase (1971) J Biol Chem, 246, pp. 2561-2573; Kusian, B., Sultemeyer, D., Bowien, B., Carbonic anhydrase is essential for growth of Ralstonia eutropha at ambient CO2 concentrations (2002) J Bacteriol, 184 (18), pp. 5018-5026. , 10.1128/JB.184.18.5018-5026.2002; Liu, N., Bond, G.M., Abel, A., McPherson, B.J., Stringer, J., Biomimetic sequestration of CO2 in carbonate form: Role of produced waters and other brines (2005) Fuel Process Technol, 86, pp. 1615-1625. , 10.1016/j.fuproc.2005.01.008; Lowry, O.H., Rosebrough, N.J., Farr, A.L., Randall, R.J., Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent (1951) J Biol Chem, 193, pp. 265-275; Lu, J.-J., Perng, C.-L., Lee, S.-Y., Wan, C.-C., Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (2000) Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 38 (6), pp. 2076-2080; Maguire, J., Watkin, N., Carbonic anhydrase inhibition (1975) Bull Environ Contam Toxicol, 13, pp. 625-629. , 10.1007/BF01685190; McKibbin, W.J., Wilcoxen, P.J., (2002) Climate Change Policy after Kyoto: Blueprint for A Realistic Approach, , Brookings Institution Press Washington; Mirjafari, P., Asghari, K., Mahinpey, N., Investigating the application of enzyme carbonic anhydrase for CO 2 sequestration purposes (2007) Ind Eng Chem Res, 46, pp. 921-926. , 10.1021/ie060287u; Moroney, J.V., Somanchi, A., How do algae concentrate CO2 to increase the efficiency of photosynthetic carbon fixation?
