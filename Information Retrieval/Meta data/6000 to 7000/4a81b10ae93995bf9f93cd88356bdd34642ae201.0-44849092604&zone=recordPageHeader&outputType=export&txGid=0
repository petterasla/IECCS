Here, we studied species turnover in 51 butterfly assemblages in Britain since 1976, examining extinction and colonisation events together with variation in the abundances of the species. We showed that the species turnover that occurred over 20 years in Britain was associated with colonisation and extinction events and also with variability in the abundance of the species. These changes in community composition differed according to the habitat requirements of the species and their previous distributions, being more evident for habitat specialists and for southerly distributed species. Colonising species often became abundant components of the communities they joined, although this was more evident for generalist than for specialist species. The abundance of species following their arrival, increased with time since colonisation. Species turnover associated with southerly species expanding northwards is consistent with being a response to climate change. The results suggest that climate- and habitat-driven changes in the identity and abundance of species within communities are widespread, and probably ubiquitous. Similar changes are likely to be occurring in other groups of organisms that are similarly undertaking major range shifts associated with climate change. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Abundance; Assemblage; Climate change; Distribution; Extinction; Lepidoptera; Species turnover","abundance; butterfly; climate change; climate effect; colonization; community composition; extinction; geographical distribution; habitat structure; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Lepidoptera",,,,,,"Asher, J., Warren, M., Fox, R., Harding, P., Jeffcoate, G., Jeffcoate, S., (2001) The Millennium Atlas of Butterflies in Britain and Ireland, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Beaugrand, G., Brander, K.M., Lindley, J.A., Souissi, S., Reid, P.C., Plankton effect on cod recruitment in the North Sea (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 661-664; Beaugrand, G., Reid, P.C., Long-term changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton and salmon related to climate (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 801-817; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Cardillo, M., Mace, G.M., Jones, K.E., Multiple causes of high extinction risk in large mammal species (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1239-1241; Colwell, R.K., (2005) EstimateS-statistical Estimation of Species Richness and Shared Species From Samples Version 7.5, , http://purl.oclc.org/estimates, User's guide and application published at; Cowley, M.J.R., Thomas, C.D., Thomas, J.A., Warren, M.S., Flight areas of British butterflies: Assessing species status and decline (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 266, pp. 1587-1592; Fox, R., Asher, J., Brereton, T., Roy, D., Warren, M.S., (2006) The State of Butterflies in Britain and Ireland, , Pisces Publications, UK; Franco, A.M.A., Hill, J.K., Kitschke, C., Impacts of climate warming and habitat loss on extinctions at species' low-latitude range boundaries (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 1545-1553; Genner, M.J., Sims, D.W., Wearmouth, V.J., Southall, E.J., Southward, A.J., Henderson, P.A., Hawkins, S.J., Regional climatic warming drives long-term community changes of British marine fish (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 271, pp. 655-661; Hickling, R., Roy, D.B., Hill, J.K., Fox, R., Thomas, C.D., The distributions of a wide range of taxonomic groups are expanding polewards (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 450-455; Hill, J.K., Collingham, Y.C., Thomas, C.D., Blakeley, D.S., Fox, R., Moss, D., Huntley, B., Impacts of landscape structure on butterfly range expansion (2001) Ecology Letters, 4, pp. 313-321; Hill, J.K., Thomas, C.D., Huntley, B., Climate and habitat availability determine 20th century changes in a butterfly's range margins (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 266, pp. 1197-1206; Hurvich, C.M., Tsai, C.L., Regression and time series model selection in small samples (1989) Biometrika, 76, pp. 297-307; Jiguet, F., Julliard, R., Thomas, C.D., Dehorter, O., Newson, S., Couvet, D., Thermal range predicts bird population resilience to extreme high temperatures (2006) Ecology Letters, 9, pp. 1321-1330; Legendre, P., Legendre, L., (1998) Numerical Ecology, , 2nd edn.
