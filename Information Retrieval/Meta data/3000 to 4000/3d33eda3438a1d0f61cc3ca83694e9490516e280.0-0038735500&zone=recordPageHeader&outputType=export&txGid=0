While previous analyses have related the dynamics of northern ungulates to the NAO, there has been no comparable assessment for the species rich assemblages of tropical and subtropical Africa. Census records for 11 ungulate species in South Africa's Kruger National Park over 1977-96 reveal severe population declines by seven species, which were inadequately explained by indices of ENSO or its effects on annual rainfall totals. An additional influence was an extreme reduction in dry season rainfall, concurrent with and perhaps related to a regional temperature rise, possibly a signal of global warming. Boundary fencing now restricts range shifts by such large mammals in response to climatic variation. Our models project near extirpation of three ungulate species from the park's fauna should these climatic conditions recur.","El Niño-Southern Oscillation; Extinctions; Global warming; Large herbivores; Population dynamics; Rainfall variability","El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; population decline; population dynamics; protected area; rainfall; ungulate; South Africa; Mammalia; Ungulata",,,,,,"Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (1998) Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , Springer Verlag, New York; Campbell, K., Borner, M.B., Population trends and distribution of Serengeti herbivores: Implications for management (1995) Serengeti II.
