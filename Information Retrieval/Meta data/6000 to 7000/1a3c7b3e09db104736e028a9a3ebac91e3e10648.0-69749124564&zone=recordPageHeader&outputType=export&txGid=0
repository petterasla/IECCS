It elucidates the strong link between the cryosphere, oceans and atmosphere. The above aspects are built on a wealth of proxy data from different archives and from across the globe. However, as the studies indicate, there are major limitations as well that hamper a proper understanding of the forcing mechanisms behind the long-term as well as abrupt climate changes. The most serious handicap is the lack of synchronization of records from various archives. Some critical areas such as the Southern Ocean remain grossly under sampled.","Cenozic; Climate change; Glaciation; Neogene; Southern ocean","Cenozoic; climate change; cryosphere; freezing; glaciation; ice sheet; Neogene; paleoclimate; Antarctica; Southern Ocean",,,,,,"Dansgaard, W., Johnsen, S.J., Clausen, H.B., Dahl-Jensen, D., Gundestrup, N.S., Hammer, C.U., Hvidberg, C.S., Bond, G., Evidence for general instability of past climate from a 250-kyr ice-core record (1993) Nature, 364, pp. 218-220; Rajan, S., Khare, N., Emerging visions in Indian marine geosciences - the Southern oceans (2005) Proceedings of the National Seminar on ""Four Decades of Marine Geosciences in India- A Retrospective, 74, pp. 70-76. , Geological Survey of India, Spl.
