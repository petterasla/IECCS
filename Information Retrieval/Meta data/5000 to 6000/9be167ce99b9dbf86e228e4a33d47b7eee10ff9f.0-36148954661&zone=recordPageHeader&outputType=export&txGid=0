However, the life cycle assessment (LCA) of any hydroelectric plant shows that GHG emissions occur at different phases of the power plant's life. This work examines the role of decommissioning hydroelectric dams in greenhouse gas emissions. Accumulated sediments in reservoirs contain noticeable levels of carbon, which may be released to the atmosphere upon decommissioning of the dam. The rate of sediment accumulation and the sediment volume for six of the ten largest United States hydroelectric power plants is surveyed. The amount of sediments and the respective carbon content at the moment of dam decommissioning (100 years after construction) was estimated. The released carbon is partitioned into CO 2 and CH4 emissions and converted to CO2 equivalent emissions using the global warming potential (GWP) method. The global warming effect (GWE) due to dam decommissioning is normalized to the total electricity produced over the lifetime of each power plant. The estimated GWE of the power plants range from 128-380 g of CO2eq./kWh when 11% of the total available sediment organic carbon (SOC) is mineralized and between 35 and 104 g of CO2eq./kWh when 3% of the total SOC is mineralized. Though these values are below emission factors for coal power plants (890 g of CO 2eq./kWh), the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the sediments upon dam decommissioning is a notable amount that should not be ignored and must be taken into account when considering construction and relicensing of hydroelectric dams. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon; Dams; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Sediments; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Hydroelectric dams; Hydroelectric power; carbon dioxide; dam; decommissioning; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power plant; life cycle analysis; partitioning; sedimentation; North America; United States",,,,,,"Aberg, J., Bergstrom, A., Algesten, G., Soderback, K., Jansson, M., A comparison of the carbon balances of a natural lake and a hydroelectric reservoir in Northern Sweden (2004) Water Res, 38, pp. 531-538. , 3; Abril, G., Richard, S., Guerin, F., In Situ measurements of dissolved gases (CO2 and CH 4) in a wide range of concentrations in a tropical reservoir using an equilibrator (2006) Sci Total Environ, 354, pp. 246-251; Annandale, G.W., Morris, G.L., Morris, G.L., Fan, J., Decommissioning of dams (1998) Reservoir Sedimentation Handbook, , McGraw-Hill New York; Bartlett, K.B., Harriss, R.C., Review and assessment of methane emissions from wetlands (1993) Chemosphere, 26, pp. 261-320; Bastviken, D., Persson, L., Odham, G., Tranvik, L., Degradation of dissolved organic matter in oxic and anoxic lake water (2004) Limnol Oceanogr, 49, pp. 109-116. , 1; Campbell, I.D., Campbell, C., Vitt, D.H., Laird, L.D., Trew, D., Kotak, B., Leclair, D., Bayley, S., A first estimate of organic carbon strorage in Holocene Lake sediments in Alberta, Canada (2000) J Paleolimnol, 24, pp. 395-400; Chamberland, A., Levesque, S., Hydroelectricity, an options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from thermal power plants (1996) Energy Convers Manag, 37, pp. 885-890. , 6-8; Dannenberg, S., Wudler, J., Conrad, R., Agitation of anoxic paddy soils slurries affects the performance of the methanogenic microbial community (1997) Microbiol Ecol, 22, pp. 257-263; Delmas, R., Galy-Lacaux, C., Richard, S., Emissions of greenhouse gases from the tropical hydroelectric reservoir of Petit Saut (French Guiana) compared with emissions from thermal alternatives (2001) Glob Biogeochem Cycles, 15, pp. 993-1003. , 4; Dendy, F.E., Champion, W.A., (1970) Summary of Reservoir Sediment Deposition Surveys Made in the United States Through 1970, , Miscellaneous Publication No. 1266, Agricultural Research Service, USDA; Dendy, F.E., Champion, W.A., (1975) Sediment Deposition in U.S. Reservoirs: Summary of Data Reported Through 1975, , Miscellaneous Publication Number 1362, United States Department of Agriculture; Den Heyer, C., Kalff, J., Organic matter mineralization rates in sediments: A within- and among lake study (1998) Limnol Oceanogr, 43, pp. 695-705. , 4; Dones, R., Frischknecht, R., Life-cycle assessment of photovoltaic systems: Results of Swiss studies on energy chains (1998) Prog Photovolt: Res Appl, 6, pp. 117-125; Duchemin, E., Lucotte, M., Canuel, R., Chamberland, A., Production of the greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 by hydroelectric reservoirs of the boreal region (1995) Glob Biogeochem Cycles, 9, pp. 529-540. , 4; Fearnside, P.M., Hydroelectric dams in the Brazilian Amazonia as sources of greenhouse gases (1995) Environ Conserv, 22, pp. 7-19; Fearnside, P.M., Greenhouse-gas emissions from Amazonian hydroelectric reservoirs: The example of Brazil's Tucurui dam as compared to fossil fuel alternatives (1997) Environ Conserv, 24, pp. 64-65; Fearnside, P.M., The preference in global warming calculations: A proposal for a unified index (2002) Ecol Econ, 41, pp. 21-31; Fearnside, P.M., Greenhouse gas emissions from hydroelectric dams: Controversies provide a springboard for rethinking a supposedly 'clean' energy source (2004) Clim Change, 66, pp. 1-8. , 1-2; Ferrari, R.L., Lake Powell survey (1988) USBR Technical Report REC-ERC-88-6; Gagnon, L., Chamberland, A., Emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs and comparison of hydroelectricity, natural-gas and oil (1993) Ambio, 22, pp. 568-569. , 8; Gagnon, L., Van De Vate, J., Greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower: The state of research in 1996 (1997) Energy Policy, 25, pp. 7-13. , 1; Gagnon, L., Bélanger, C., Uchiyama, Y., Life-cycle assessment of electricity generation options: The status of research in year 2001 (2002) Energy Policy, 30, pp. 1267-1278. , 14; Galy-Lacaux, C., Delmas, R., Kouadio, R.S., Gosse, P., Long-term greenhouse gas emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs in tropical forest regions (1999) Glob Biogeochem Cycles, 13, pp. 503-517; Glymph, L.M., Ackermann, W.C., White, G.F., Worthington, E.B., Summary: Sedimentation of reservoirs (1973) Man-made Lakes: Their Problems and Environmental Effects.
