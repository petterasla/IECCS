Trappeurs Gestionnaires Que., Sainte-Foy, Que., Canada","The raccoon (Procyon lotor) has greatly expanded its range in the Canadian prairies during the 1900s. Four non-exclusive explanations may explain this range expansion: introductions, mesopredator release, availability and suitability of winter denning sites, and food availability. No introductions of raccoons were documented for the prairies, suggesting that range expansion was not directly caused by humans. The suggestion that raccoons moved north because of ""mesopredator release"" appears implausible because, even where larger predators such as bobcats (Lynx rufus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) exist, raccoons experience low predation rates and also because raccoons have expanded their range into treeless areas where coyotes are abundant. The third hypothesis, suggesting that availability of winter denning sites limits raccoon distribution, also receives little support, mostly because of the raccoon's flexibility in using a variety of natural and anthropogenic structures for denning. The last hypothesis, the idea that raccoon range expansion has followed an increase in availability of food, appears most plausible. The effects of global warming, which affects not only the availability and diversity of foods but also the duration of the growing season (and thus temporal availability of food), probably helped raccoons colonize new areas.","Distribution; Food limitation; Global warming; Population dynamics; Procyon lotor; Raccoon; Range expansion","climate change; den; food availability; habitat availability; prairie; predation; range expansion; Canada; North America; Western Hemisphere; World; Canidae; Canis; Canis latrans; Lynx; Lynx rufus; Procyon; Procyon lotor",,,,,,"Bailey, E.D., Davis, D.E., The utilization of body fat during hibernation in woodchuck (1965) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 43, pp. 701-707; Bailey, V., A biological survey of North Dakota (1926) North American Fauna, 49, pp. 1-229; Banfield, A.W.F., (1974) The Mammals of Canada, , University of Toronto Press, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Baskin, J.A., Tertiary Procyonidae (Mammalia: Carnivora) of North America (1982) Journal of Vertebrate Paleontolology, 2, pp. 71-93; Beck, W.H., A guide to Saskatchewan mammals (1958) Saskatchewan Natural History Society, Regina, Special Publication, 1, pp. 1-52; Bennitt, R., Nagel, W.O., A survey of the resident game and furbearers of Missouri (1937) University of Missouri Studies, 12, pp. 1-215; Bird, R.D., Ecology of the aspen parkland of Western Canada (1961) Canada Department of Agriculture, Contribution, 27, pp. 1-155; Bissonnette, T.H., Csech, A.G., Sexual photoperiodicity of raccoons on low protein diet and second litters in the saine breeding season (1938) Journal of Mammalogy, 19, pp. 342-348; Boutin, S., Food supplementation experiments with terrestrial vertebrates: Patterns, problems, and the future (1990) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 68, pp. 203-220; Bradshaw, F., (1920) Report of the Chief Game Guardian, , Annual Report of the Department of Agriculture, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada; Bradshaw, F., (1925) Report of the Chief Game Guardian, , Annual Report of the Department of Agriculture, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada; Butterfield, R.T., Some raccoon and groundhog relationships (1954) Journal of Wildlife Management, 18, pp. 433-437; Chamberlain, M.J., Hodges, K.M., Leopold, B.D., Wilson, T.S., Survival and cause-specific mortality of adult raccoons in central Mississippi (1999) Journal of Wildlife Management, 63, pp. 880-888; Cowan, W.F., (1973) Ecology and Life History of the Raccoon (Procyon Lotor Hirtus Nelson and Goldman) in the Northern Part of Its Range, , Dissertation, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, USA; Dorney, R.S., Ecology of marsh raccoons (1954) Journal of Wildlife Management, 18, pp. 217-225; Dunn, J.P., Chapman, J.A., Reproduction, physiological responses, age structure, and food habits of raccoon in Maryland, USA (1983) Zeitschrift für Säugetierkunde, 48, pp. 161-175; Endres, K.M., Smith, W.P., Influence of age, sex, season and availability on den selection by raccoons within the Central Basin of Tennessee (1993) American Midland Naturalist, 129, pp. 116-131; Fritzell, E.K., Aspects of raccoon (Procyon lotor) social organization (1978) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 56, pp. 260-271; Fritzell, E.K., Habitat use by prairie raccoons during the waterfowl breeding season (1978) Journal of Wildlife Management, 42, pp. 118-127; Fritzell, E.K., Reproduction of raccoons (Procyon lotor) in North Dakota (1978) American Midland Naturalist, 100, pp. 253-256; Fritzell, E.K., Greenwood, R.J., Mortality of raccoons in North Dakota (1984) Prairie Naturalist, 16, pp. 1-4; Gehrt, S.D., Raccoons and allies (2003) Wild Mammals of North America: Biology, Management, and Economics, pp. 611-634. , G.
