A static (passive CO2 absorption in an alkali trap over 24 h) and a dynamic (portable infra-red CO2 gas analyzer over 1-2 min) chamber method were compared. Both methods were used for 100 different site x treatment x time combinations in temperate arable, forest and pasture ecosystems. Soil surface CO2 flux estimates covered a wide range from 0 to ca. 300 mg CO2 C m-2 h-1 by the static method and from 0 to ca. 2500 mg CO2 C m-2 h-1 by the dynamic method. The relationship between results from the two methods was highly non-linear, and was best explained by an exponential equation. When compared to the dynamic method, the static method gave on average 12% higher flux rates below 100 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1, but much lower flux rates above 100 mg CO2 C m-2 h-1. Spatial variability was large for both methods, necessitating a large number of replicates for reliable field data, with typical coefficients of variation being in the range 10-60%, usually higher with the dynamic than the state method. Diurnal variability in soil surface CO2 flux was partly correlated with soil temperature, whereas day-to-day variability was more unpredictable. However, use of a mechanistic simulation model of CO2 transport in soil SOILCO2, showed that very large day-to-day changes in soil surface CO2 flux can result from rainfall events causing relatively small changes in soil water content above field capacity (ca. -10 kPa), even if CO2 production rates remained relatively unaffected.",,"carbon dioxide; chamber method; method comparison; organic matter; respiration; soil temperature; soil water",,,,,,"Anderson, J.P.E., Soil respiration (1982) Methods of Soil Analysis.
