Herein, we describe the development of arrays of more powerful and efficient infrared heaters with ceramic heating elements. By tilting the heaters at 45° from horizontal and combining six of them in a hexagonal array, good uniformity of warming was achieved across 3-m-diameter plots. Moreover, there do not appear to be obstacles (other than financial) to scaling to larger plots. The efficiency [ηh (%); thermal radiation out per electrical energy in] of these heaters was higher than that of the heaters used in most previous infrared heater experiments and can be described by: ηh = 10 + 25exp(-0.17 u), where u is wind speed at 2m height (m s-1). Graphs are presented to estimate operating costs from degrees of warming, two types of plant canopy, and site windiness. Four such arrays were deployed over plots of grass at Haibei, Qinghai, China and another at Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA, along with corresponding reference plots with dummy heaters. Proportional integral derivative systems with infrared thermometers to sense canopy temperatures of the heated and reference plots were used to control the heater outputs. Over month-long periods at both sites, about 75% of canopy temperature observations were within 0.5 °C of the set-point temperature differences between heated and reference plots. Electrical power consumption per 3-m-diameter plot averaged 58 and 80 kW h day-1 for Haibei and Cheyenne, respectively. However, the desired temperature differences were set lower at Haibei (1.2 °C daytime, 1.7 °C night) than Cheyenne (1.5 °C daytime, 3.0 °C night), and Cheyenne is a windier site. Thus, we conclude that these hexagonal arrays of ceramic infrared heaters can be a successful temperature free-air-controlled enhancement (T-FACE) system for warming ecosystem field plots. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Canopy temperature; Climate change; Ecosystems; GIS; Global change; Global warming; Infrared heater; Rangeland; Thermal radiation; Wind speed","array; ceramics; experimental study; forest canopy; GIS; global change; global warming; heating; temperature gradient; Asia; Cheyenne; China; Eurasia; Far East; North America; Qinghai; United States; Wyoming",,,,,,"Allen, R.G., Walter, I.A., Elliott, R.L., Howell, T.A., Itenfisu, D., Jensen, M.E., Snyder, R.L., (2005) The ASCE Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration Equation, , American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA; Beier, C., Emmett, B., Gundersen, P., Novel approaches to study climate change effects on terrestrial ecosystems in the field - drought and passive night time warming (2004) Ecosystems, 7, pp. 583-597; Bridgham, S.D., Pastor, J., Updegraff, K., Malterer, T.J., Johnson, K., Harth, C., Chen, J., Ecosystem control over temperatures and energy flux in northern peatlands (1999) Ecological Applications, 9, pp. 1345-1358; Campbell, G.S., (1977) An Introduction to Environmental Biophysics, , Springer-Verlag, New York, NY; Harte, J., Shaw, R., Shifting dominance within a montane vegetation community: Results of a climate-warming experiment (1995) Science, 267, pp. 876-880; Harte, J., Torn, M.S., Chang, F.-R., Feifarek, B., Kinzig, A., Shaw, R., Shen, K., Global warming and soil microclimate results from a meadow-warming experiment (1995) Ecological Applications, 5, pp. 132-150; Hendrey, G.R., (1993) Free-air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment for Plant Research in the Field, , C.
