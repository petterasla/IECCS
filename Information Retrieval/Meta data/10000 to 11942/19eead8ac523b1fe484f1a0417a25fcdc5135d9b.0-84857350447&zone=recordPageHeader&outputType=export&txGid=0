Now, however, the reverse is beginning to happen, i.e. environmental trends are beginning to shape our economy and health status. In addition to water, air and food, animals and birds play a pivotal role in the maintenance and transmission of important zoonotic diseases in nature. It is generally considered that the prevalence of vector-borne and waterborne zoonoses is likely to increase in the coming years due to the effects of global warming in India. In recent years, vector-borne diseases have emerged as a serious public health problem in countries of the South-East Asia region, including India. Vector-borne zoonoses now occur in epidemic form almost on an annual basis, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. New reservoir areas of cutaneous leishmaniosis in South India have been recognised, and the role of climate change in its re-emergence warrants further research, as does the role of climate change in the ascendancy of waterborne and foodborne illness. Similarly, climate change that leads to warmer and more humid conditions may increase the risk of transmission of airborne zoonoses, and hot and drier conditions may lead to a decline in the incidence of disease(s). The prevalence of these zoonotic diseases and their vectors and the effect of climate change on important zoonoses in India are discussed in this review.","Climate change; India; Zoonosis","animal; article; classification; climate change; disease carrier; disease transmission; food poisoning; human; India; microbiology; water pollution; zoonosis; Air Microbiology; Animals; Climate Change; Disease Vectors; Foodborne Diseases; Humans; India; Water Pollution; Zoonoses; Animalia; Aves",,,,,,"Ahmed, J., Alp, H., Muhammed, A., Ulrike, S., Current status of ticks in Asia (2007) Parasitol.
