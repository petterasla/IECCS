We used a simulation model [Combo (""COral Mortality and Bleaching Output"")] to estimate future coral cover in the part of the eastern Caribbean impacted by a massive coral bleaching event in 2005. Combo calculates impacts of future climate change on coral reefs by combining impacts from long-term changes in average sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidification with impacts from episodic high temperature mortality (bleaching) events. We used mortality and heat dose data from the 2005 bleaching event to select historic temperature datasets, to use as a baseline for running Combo under different future climate scenarios and sets of assumptions. Results suggest a bleak future for coral reefs in the eastern Caribbean. For three different emissions scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; B1, A1B, and A1FI), coral cover on most Caribbean reefs is projected to drop below 5% by the year 2035, if future mortality rates are equivalent to some of those observed in the 2005 event (50%). For a scenario where corals gain an additional 1-1. 5°C of heat tolerance through a shift in the algae that live in the coral tissue, coral cover above 5% is prolonged until 2065. Additional impacts such as storms or anthropogenic damage could result in declines in coral cover even faster than those projected here. These results suggest the need to identify and preserve the locations that are likely to have a higher resiliency to bleaching to save as many remnant populations of corals as possible in the face of projected wide-spread coral loss. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"Climatic changes; Coral bleaching; Coral mortality; Coral reef; Coral tissue; Data sets; Ecosystem services; Emissions scenarios; Future climate; Heat tolerance; High temperature; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Long-term changes; Mortality rate; Ocean chemistry; Sea surface temperatures; Simulation model; Atmospheric temperature; Bleaching; Cleaning; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Global warming; Tissue; Reefs; acidification; anthropogenic effect; coastal zone management; coral bleaching; coral reef; data set; ecosystem service; global warming; high temperature; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; long-term change; mortality; numerical model; sea surface temperature; tolerance; Caribbean Islands; algae; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Baker, A.C., Glynn, P.W., Riegl, B., Climate change and coral reef bleaching: an ecological assessment of long-term impacts, recovery trends, and future outlook (2008) Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 80, pp. 435-471; Bouchon, C., Portillo, P., Bouchon-Navaro, Y., Max, L., Hoetjes, P., Brathwaite, A., Roach, R., Day, O., Status of coral reefs of the Lesser Antilles after the 2005 coral beaching event (2008) Status of Caribbean coral reefs after bleaching and hurricanes in 2005, pp. 85-103. , In: Wilkinson C, Souter D (eds),Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, and Reef and Rainforest Research Centre, Townsville; Buddemeier, R.W., Smith, S.V., Coral reef growth in an era of rapidly rising sea level: predictions and suggestions for long-term research (1988) Coral Reefs, 7, pp. 51-56; Buddemeier, R.W., Jokiel, P.L., Zimmerman, K.M., Lane, D.R., Carey, J.M., Bohling, G.C., Martinich, J.A., A modeling tool to evaluate regional coral reef responses to changes in climate and ocean chemistry (2008) Limnol Oceanogr Methods, 6, pp. 395-411; Burke, L., Maidens, J., (2004) Reefs at risk in the Caribbean, , World Resources Institute, Washington, DC; Casey, K.S., Cornillon, P., A comparison of satellite and in situ based sea surface temperature climatologies (1999) J Climate, 12, pp. 1848-1863; Causey, B., Coral reefs of the U.
