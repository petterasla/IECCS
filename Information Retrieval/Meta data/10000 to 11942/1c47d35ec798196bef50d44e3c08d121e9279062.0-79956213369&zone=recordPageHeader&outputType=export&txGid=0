An approach is presented to understand and assess these impacts on the Norwegian building stock in a changing climate. The approach is tested using calculations for the decay potential in timber structures (possessing wood cladding, timber frames or both). First, building data and climate data are compiled in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Second, the computer model calculates the number of buildings that could be affected by a particular climate parameter for historical climate data (1961-1990) and a future climate scenario (2071-2100). The results show that today approximately 615000 buildings are situated in areas with a high potential risk of rot-decay. In 2100 this number could increase to roughly 2.4 million. The large current amount of wooden buildings and a high number of building defects indicates that future new and refurbished buildings need to be built more robustly to meet the future impacts of climate change. Other climate parameters, e.g. sea level rise, changes in permafrost, the risk of frost decay, temperature change and changes in the amount of wet winter precipitation - are under investigation for their effect on the Norwegian building stock. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","adaptation measures; building stock; climate change; impact assessments; Norway; robust buildings; rot-decay risk; timber buildings","adaptation measures; building stock; impact assessments; Norway; robust buildings; rot-decay risk; timber buildings; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Meteorological problems; Sea level; Timber; Wooden buildings; Climate models",,,,,,"Almas, A.J., (2005) New Climate Data for Design of Building Enclosures, , Master's thesis, Department of Civil and Transport Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim.
