At the time of the fire, studies of two subalpine faunal assemblages were being undertaken. The opportunity to resurvey the assemblages was taken in order to examine the immediate impact of fire in an environment where it is uncommon but predicted to occur increasingly with global warming. A study area in the Whites River Valley, where the number of bird species was counted monthly from 1996 to 2003, and weekly in late winter-spring from 2000 to 2003, was burnt in one fire. As well as the expected decrease in the number of individual birds, the fire resulted in an immediate decrease in the number of bird species, unlike in previously studied montane forest, with only the regularly wintering species plus the olive whistler and the ground-feeding flame robin remaining. During the post-winter avian immigration, few regular spring migrants appeared on burnt sites despite their nearby presence on the unburnt side of the valley. Five of six small mammal trapping grids were burnt. As with fires at lower altitudes, there was an immediate reduction in mammal numbers on burnt grids following the fire, but in addition, one species, Mastacomys fuscus, declined further in the ensuing 2 months both on burnt and unburnt sites. Numbers of Antechinus swainsonii and Rattus fuscipes stabilized until autumn/winter when there was a further decline due to the unavailability of subnivean space to allow winter foraging, allied with a concentration of fox predation on areas still carrying populations of small mammals. © 2006 Ecological Society of Australia.","Alpine; Bird migration; Fox; Small mammal; Snow","bird; fauna; global warming; immigration; landscape; mammal; montane forest; subalpine environment; wildfire; Australasia; Australia; Australian Alps; Snowy Mountains; Antechinus swainsonii; Aves; Mammalia; Mastacomys fuscus; Rattus fuscipes",,,,,,"Banks, J.C.G., A history of forest fire in the Australian Alps (1989) The Scientific Significance of the Australian Alps, pp. 265-280. , ed.
