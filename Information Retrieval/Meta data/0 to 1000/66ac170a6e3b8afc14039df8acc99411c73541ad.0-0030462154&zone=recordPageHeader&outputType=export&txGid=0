Estimates take into account (a) uncertainty in the level of climate change expected, using a range of climate change scenarios; (b) physiological effects of carbon dioxide on the crops; and (c) different adaptive responses. In all cases, the effects of climate change induced by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide depended on the counteracting effects among higher daily evapotranspiration rates, shortening of crop growth duration, and changes in precipitation patterns, as well as the effects of carbon dioxide on crop growth and water-use efficiency. Although results varied depending on the geographical locations of the regions tested, the production of rice (the main food crop in the region) generally did not benefit from climate change. In South and Southeast Asia, there is concern about how climate change may affect El Nino/Southern Oscillation events, since these play a key role in determining agricultural production. Furthermore, problems arising from variability of water availability and soil degradation are currently major challenges to agriculture in the region. These problems may be exacerbated in the future if global climate change projections are realized. Many studies have considered strategies for improving agricultural management, based on the optimization of crop management decisions. Climate change analyses could be further strengthened by economic studies that integrate the potential use of natural resources across sectors.","agriculture; Asia; El Nino","agriculture; air pollution; asia; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; meteorology; nonhuman; adaptation; agricultural impact; climate change; crop production; El Nino/Southern Oscillation; Asia; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Evapotranspiration; Optimization; Precipitation (meteorology); Public policy; Strategic planning; Climate change vulnerability; Crop management; Crop production; El Nino phenomenon; Southern Oscillation phenomenon; Climate change",,,,,,"Acock, B., Allen Jr., L.H., Crop responses to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations (1985) Direct Effects of Increasing Carbon Dioxide on Vegetation, pp. 53-97. , Strain B.R. and Cure J.D.
