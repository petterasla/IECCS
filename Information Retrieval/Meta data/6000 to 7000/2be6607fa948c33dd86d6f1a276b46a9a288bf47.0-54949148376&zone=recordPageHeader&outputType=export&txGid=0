For the realization of the technique, the acoustic tomography of two-dimensional vortex air flow profile was proposed, which can be reconstructed by arraying approximately 10 pairs of transmitters and receivers in parallel. To show the feasibility of the present method, experimental results of performance evaluation using an indoor simulation system are presented. In particular, the reproducibilities of time and space variations of the vortex wind fields passing through the monitoring region were examined. To achieve the real-time capability, a correction scheme for the error caused by the time lag in the sequential sampling was introduced. As a result, vortex wind velocity fields could be reconstructed with a high-speed frame rate while keeping a satisfactory tractability against time and space vortex wind field variations. © 2008 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Acoustic travel time tomography; Monitoring of vortex wind gust; Straight ray path CT; Tornado disaster prevention; Vortex air flow imaging","Acoustic fields; Acoustic receivers; Acoustic wave transmission; Acoustics; Air; Diagnostic radiography; Disaster prevention; Error correction; Global warming; Medical imaging; Tomography; Acoustic tomographies; Acoustic travel time tomography; Air flows; Correction schemes; Frame rates; Imaging; Indoor simulations; Performance evaluations; Present methods; Reproducibilities; Sequential samplings; Space variations; Straight ray path CT; Time lags; Vortex air flow imaging; Wind fields; Wind velocity fields; Vortex flow",,,,,,"Webster, P.J., Holland, G.J., Curry, J.A., Chang, H.R., (2005) Science, 309, p. 1844; Saito, I., Mizutani, K., Wakatsuki, N., (2007) Jpn.
