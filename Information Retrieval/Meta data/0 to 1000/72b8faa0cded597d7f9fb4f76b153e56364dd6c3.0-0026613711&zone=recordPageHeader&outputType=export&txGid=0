Hydro(chloro)-fluorocarbons, H(C)FCs, having a relatively low or no ozone depletion potential, are expected to partially replace CFCs. However, these H(C)FCs vary in global warming potential (GWP). Two groups can be distinguished: Class I H(C)FCs (HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, HFC-125, HFC-134a and HFC-143a) have a relatively high GWP, and Class II H(C)FCs (HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HCFC-141b and HFC-152a) have a relatively low GWP. In this study, using a 0-dimensional computer model, temperature forcing by halocarbons between 1985 and 2100 is calculated assuming different production scenarios for the halocarbons: CFCs, H(C)FCs, CH3CCl3 and CCl4. The results indicate that, while strongly restricting the use of CFCs, the most important factors determining the impact of halocarbons on future global warming may be the choice of H(C)FCs and the presence or absence of restrictions on H(C)FC applications. Unrestricted use of H(C)FCs exclusively from Class I could, by 2100, result in an equilibrium temperature increase that is 0.28-0.66°C higher than that resulting from the use of Class II H(C)FCs. However, if there is a phase-out of CFCs and Class I H(C)FCs by 2000, and if Class II H(C)FCs are only used as well-conserved refrigerants, the long-term climatic impact of halocarbons could become lower than the present impact of halocarbons. The same holds if there is a rapid total phase-out of radiatively active halocarbons. © 1992.",,"chlorinated hydrocarbon; chlorofluorocarbon; fluorinated hydrocarbon; article; climate; greenhouse effect; ozone layer; air pollution; CFC; climatic change; computer model; global warming; halocarbon; man-environment relations; pollution control; simulation model",,,,,,"ACSL, (1987) Advanced Continous Simulation Language, , Mitchell and Gauthier Associates, Concord, Mass; DuPont de Nemours International S.A., (1990) Fluorocarbon/ozone up date, pp. 1-4. , September; Farman, Gardiner, Shanklin, Large losses of total ozone in Antarctica reveal seasonal ClOx/NOx interaction (1985) Nature, 315, pp. 207-210; Fisher, Hales, Wang, Ko, Sze, Model calculations of the relative effects of CFCs and their replacement on global warming (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 513-516; Fisher, Hales, Filkin, Ko, Sze, Conell, Wuebbles, Stordal, Model calculations of the relative effects of CFCs and their replacements on stratospheric ozone (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 508-512; Hammitt, Camm, Connell, Mooz, Wolf, Wuebbles, Bamezai, Future emission scenarios for chemicals that may deplete the ozone layer (1987) Nature, 330, pp. 711-716; Hansen, Lacis, Prather, Greenhouse effect of chlorofluorocarbons and other trace gases (1989) J.
