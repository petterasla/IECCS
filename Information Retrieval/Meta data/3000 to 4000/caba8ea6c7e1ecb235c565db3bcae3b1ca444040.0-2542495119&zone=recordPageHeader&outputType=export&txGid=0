Methane, which generally exceeds 90 vol% of the gas phase, is emitted at high rates during and after emplacement of the mud domes and is known for its high global warming potential (GWP). This comprehensive estimate of the annual contribution of mud volcano degassing assesses the significance of mud volcanism for the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A first-order estimate for the earlier, pre-anthropogenic volume of methane released through mud volcanoes further supports their profound effect on the Earth's climate since at least the Paleozoic (570 Ma). © Springer-Verlag 2003.","Climate change; Emission; Methane; Mud volcanism","climate effect; degassing; greenhouse gas; methane; mud volcano; Paleozoic",,,,,,"Aloisi, G., Asjes, S., Bakker, K., Bakker, M., Charlou, J.L., De Lange, G.J., Donval, J.-P., Zitter, T., Linking Mediterranean brine pools and mud volcanism (2000) EOS Trans AGU, 81 (51), pp. 625-632; Bagirov, E., Lerche, I., Flame hazards in the South Caspian Basin (1998) Energy Explor Exploit, 16, pp. 373-397; Bagirov, E., Nadirov, R., Lerche, I., Flaming eruptions and ejections from mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan: Statistical risk assessment from the historical records (1996) Energy Explor Exploit, 14, pp. 535-583; Barber, A.J., Tjokrosapoetro, S., Charlton, T.R., Mud volcanoes, shale diapirs, wrench faults and mélanges in accretionary complexes, eastern Indonesia (1986) AAPG Bull, 70, pp. 1729-1741; Brantley, S.L., Koepenick, K.W., Measured carbon dioxide emissions from Oldoinyo Lengai and the skewed distribution of passive volcanic fluxes (1995) Geology, 23, pp. 933-936; Brown, K.M., The nature and hydrogeologic significance of mud diapirs and diatremes for accretionary systems (1990) J Geophys Res, 95, pp. 8969-8982; Chiodini, G., D'Alessandro, W., Parello, F., Geochemistry of gases and waters discharged by the mud volcanoes at Paterno, Mt.
