The manners in which the approach may serve as an instrument for facilitating negotiation and implementation of a climate regime are discussed, and an operational definition is suggested. A key question with regard to the employment of a comprehensive approach in climate politics concerns how well methodologies for comparing gases perform. This question is discussed with regard to Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). When the most important greenhouse gases are concerned, we suggest that in the absence of better alternatives, the use of GWPs may serve as a preliminary tool for policy making until better methods are developed. It is emphasized that the choice of time horizon has significant ecological and political implications that should be taken into account.",,"climate change; comprehensive approach; environmental policy; policy making; politics",,,,,,"noteMasood, E., Industrial world is unlikely to meet promised carbon cuts (1996) Nature, 382, p. 103; Paterson, M., Global warning (1992) The Environment in International Relations, , Thomas, C.

Cambridge University Press; It is an obvious condition that the emission sources for the gases to be included are reasonably well knownSulfate aerosols have negligible effects on long-wave radiation. In addition, by affecting clouds, SO2 indirectly affects the fluxes of long-wave radiation. These effects are small compared to the short-wave effectsnoteCO2 reductions achieved by applying technology for improving energy efficiency may in some cases increase NOx emissionsThe IPCC has started the work on a Special Report on the climate impacts of aircraft emissionsnotenoteLelieveld, J., Van Dorland, R., Ozone Chemistry changes in the troposphere and consequent radiative forcing of climate (1995) Atmospheric Ozone as a Climate Gas, pp. 227-258. , Wang, W.-C. and Isaksen, I.S.A.
