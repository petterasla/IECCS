Especially, the often-dominant crustaceans could be negatively affected because cyanobacteria are deficient in phytosterols, which are required by the crustaceans to form the membrane component cholesterol, which in turn plays a role in thermal adaptation. Here, we determined the influence of temperature on growth, reproduction and the allocation of dietary sterol into somatic tissues and eggs of the keystone species Daphnia magna raised along a dietary cholesterol gradient. Mass-specific growth rates of D. magna increased with the increasing availability of dietary cholesterol up to an incipient limiting level, which increased with increasing temperature. This indicates a higher demand for cholesterol for growth at higher temperatures and may explain the consistently smaller clutch sizes of reproducing females at the highest temperature. The cholesterol content of the individuals increased with increasing dietary cholesterol; this increase was enhanced at higher temperatures, indicating a higher demand for cholesterol for tissues and probably specifically for membranes. Surprisingly, the daphnids showed different allocation strategies with regard to temperature and dietary sterol availability. The cholesterol content of eggs was enhanced at higher temperature, which suggested that females allocate more cholesterol to their offspring, presumably to ensure sufficient egg development. When dietary cholesterol was limiting, however, females did not allocate more cholesterol to their eggs. Our data suggest that during cyanobacterial blooms, a potential dietary sterol limitation of Daphnia can be intensified at higher water temperatures, which can occur with global warming.","Allocation strategy; Cholesterol; Growth; Reproduction; Temperature adaptation; Zooplankton","cholesterol; sterol; animal; article; cholesterol intake; clutch size; Daphnia; female; fertility; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; metabolism; oocyte; physiology; temperature; Animals; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, Dietary; Clutch Size; Daphnia; Female; Fertility; Global Warming; Ovum; Sterols; Temperature; Crustacea; Cyanobacteria; Daphnia; Daphnia magna; Daphniidae",,"cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, 57-88-5; Cholesterol, Dietary; Sterols",,,,"Ahlgren, G., Goedkoop, W., Markensten, H., Sonesten, L., Boberg, M., Seasonal variations in food quality for pelagic and benthic invertebrates in Lake Erken - the role of fatty acids (1997) Freshwater Biol., 38 (3), pp. 555-570; Angilletta, M.J., Steury, T.D., Sears, M.W., Temperature, growth rate, and body size in ectotherms: Fitting pieces of a life-history puzzle (2004) Lntegr.
