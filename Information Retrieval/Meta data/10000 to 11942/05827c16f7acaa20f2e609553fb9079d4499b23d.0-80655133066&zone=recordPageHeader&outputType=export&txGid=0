However, the impact of weather fluctuations on hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which primarily affects children, is not well understood. Methods: We acquired data related to cases of HFMD and weather parameters of temperature and humidity in Fukuoka, Japan between 2000 and 2010, and used time-series analyses to assess the possible relationship of weather variability with pediatric HFMD cases, adjusting for seasonal and interannual variations. Results: Our analysis revealed that the weekly number of HFMD cases increased by 11.2% (95% CI: 3.2-19.8) for every 1°C increase in average temperature and by 4.7% (95% CI: 2.4-7.2) for every 1% increase in relative humidity. Notably, the effects of temperature and humidity on HFMD infection were most significant in children under the age of 10. years. Conclusions: Our study provides quantitative evidence that the number of HFMD cases increased significantly with increasing average temperature and relative humidity, and suggests that preventive measures for limiting the spread of HFMD, particularly in younger children, should be considered during extended periods of high temperature and humidity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic change; Hand, foot, and mouth disease; Humidity; Temperature; Weather","Average temperature; Climatic changes; Effects of temperature; Fukuoka , Japan; Global climate changes; Hand, foot, and mouth disease; High temperature; Infectious disease; Preventive measures; Seasonal and interannual variations; Weather; Weather parameters; Weather variability; Climate change; Harmonic analysis; Time series analysis; Temperature; annual variation; child health; climate change; climate effect; disease incidence; epidemiology; infectious disease; public health; relative humidity; seasonal variation; temperature effect; time series analysis; viral disease; adolescent; age distribution; article; child; climate change; controlled study; disease surveillance; geographic distribution; hand foot and mouth disease; human; humidity; incidence; infant; infection rate; Japan; major clinical study; preschool child; priority journal; quantitative analysis; school child; seasonal variation; temperature sensitivity; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; Infant; Japan; Risk Assessment; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Fukuoka [Kyushu]; Japan; Kyushu",,,,,,"Ang, L.W., Koh, B.K., Chan, K.P., Chua, L.T., James, L., Goh, K.T., Epidemiology and control of hand, foot and mouth disease in Singapore, 2001-2007 (2009) Ann Acad Med Singapore, 38, pp. 106-112; Armstrong, B., Models for the relationship between ambient temperature and daily mortality (2006) Epidemiology, 17, pp. 624-631; Belanger, M., Gray-Donald, K., O'Loughlin, J., Paradis, G., Hanley, J., Influence of weather conditions and season on physical activity in adolescents (2009) Ann Epidemiol, 19, pp. 180-186; Bendig, J.W., Fleming, D.M., Epidemiological, virological, and clinical features of an epidemic of hand, foot, and mouth disease in England and Wales (1996) Commun Dis Rep CDR Rev, 6, pp. R81-R86; Brumback, B., Burge, H.A., Neas, L.M., Ryan, L.M., Schwartz, J.D., Stark, P.C., Transitional regression models, with application to environmental time series (2000) J Am Stat Assoc, 95, pp. 16-27; Hand, foot, & mouth disease (HFMD) fast facts, , http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/hfhf.htm, Accessed march 3, 2011, at, CDC; Chen, K.T., Chang, H.L., Wang, S.T., Cheng, Y.T., Yang, J.Y., Epidemiologic features of hand-foot-mouth disease and herpangina caused by enterovirus 71 in Taiwan, 1998-2005 (2007) Pediatrics, 120, pp. e244-e252; Cohen, J.I., Enterovirus and reovirus (1998) Harrison's principles of internal medicine, pp. 1118-1123. , McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, A.S.
