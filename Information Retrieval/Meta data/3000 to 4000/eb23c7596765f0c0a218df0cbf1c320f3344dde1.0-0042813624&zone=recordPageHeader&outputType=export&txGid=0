Quantifying these processes is difficult, because much of the methane flux in shallow sediments occurs via ebullition (bubbling). Direct observation of bubble formation is not possible, and bubbling is episodic and dependent upon a number of factors. Whereas previous studies have correlated methane flux with surface wind intensity, detailed study of Lake Gatun in Panama and Lago Loiza in Puerto Rico suggest that methane flux is more closely correlated with the shear stress in sediments caused by bottom currents. Bottom currents in turn are a complex function of wind, internal pressure gradients, and lake bathymetry. A simple physical model of bottom currents and sediments in these lakes suggests that most methane ebullition originated from the upper 10-20 cm of the sediment column. Our data reaffirm previous studies showing that ebullitive methane flux is minor in water deeper than ∼5 m.","Ebullition; Methane; Tropical reservoir","bottom current; bubble; lacustrine environment; lake; methanogenesis; reservoir; sediment-water interface",,,,,,"Anderson, A.L., Abegg, F., Hawkins, J.A., Duncan, M.E., Lyons, A.P., Bubble populations and acoustic interaction with the gassy floor of Eckernforde Bay (1998) Continental Shelf Research, 18, pp. 1807-1838; Anselmann, I., Crutzen, P.J., Global distribution of natural wetlands and rice paddies, their net primary productivity, seasonality, and possible methane emissions (1989) Journal Atmospheric Chemistry, 8, pp. 307-358; Atkinson, L.P., Effect of air bubble solution on air-sea gas exchange (1973) Journal Geophysical Research, 78, pp. 962-968; Barber, T.R., Burke, R.A., Sackett, W.M., Diffusive flux of methane from warm wetlands (1988) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 2, pp. 411-425; Bartlett, K.B., Crill, P.M., Bonassi, J.A., Richey, J.E., Harriss, R.C., Methane flux from the Amazon River floodplain: Emissions during rising water (1990) Journal Geophysical Research, 95, pp. 16773-16778; Bevington, P.R., (1969) Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences, , McGraw-Hill, New York, 336 p; Bird, R.B., Steward, W.E., Lightfoot, E.N., (1960) Transport Phenomena, , Wiley, New York, 780 p; Blake, D.R., Rowland, F.S., Continuing worldwide increase in tropospheric methane, 1978 to 1987 (1988) Science, 239, pp. 1129-1131; Bogner, J.E., Sass, R.L., Walter, B.P., Model comparisons of methane oxidation across a management gradient: Wetlands, rice production systems, and landfills (2000) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 14, pp. 1021-1033; Chanton, J.P., Martens, C.S., Kelley, C.A., Gas transport from methane-saturated, tidal freshwater and wetland sediments (1989) Limnology Oceanography, 34, pp. 807-819; Cicerone, R.J., Shetter, J.D., Sources of atmospheric methane, measurements in rice paddies and a discussion (1981) Journal Geophysical Research, 86, pp. 7203-7209; Crill, P.M., Bartlett, K.B., Wilson, J.O., Sebacher, D.I., Harriss, R.C., Tropospheric methane from an Amazonian floodplain lake (1988) Journal Geophysical Research, 93, pp. 1564-1570; Dacey, J.W.M., Klug, M.J., Methane efflux from lake sediments through water lilies (1980) Science, 203, pp. 1253-1255; Devol, A.H., Richey, J.E., Clark, W.A., King, S.L., Methane emissions to the troposphere from the Amazon floodplain (1988) Journal Geophysical Research, 93, pp. 1583-1592; Dyer, K.R., (1986) Coastal and Estuarine Sediment Dynamics, , Wiley, New York, 342 p; Galy-Lacaux, C., Delmas, R., Kouadio, G., Richard, S., Gosse, P., Long term greenhouse gas emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs in tropical forest regions (1999) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 13, pp. 503-517; Jackson, D.R., Williams, K.L., Wever, T.F., Freidrichs, C.T., Wright, T.D., Sonar evidence for methane ebullition in Eckernforde Bay (1998) Continental Shelf Research, 18, pp. 1893-1915; Jannasch, H.W., Methane oxidation in Lake Kivu (central Africa) (1975) Limnology Oceanography, 20, pp. 860-864; Joyce, J.A., (1996) Physical and Chemical Controls of Methane Bubbling from Two Tropical Reservoirs, , Unpublished M.S.
