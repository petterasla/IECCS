In this study long-term data from the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) were analyzed to investigate whether there has been a change in the phenology of the ground beetle Pterostichus madidus (Fabricius, 1775). Pitfall trap data were available from 12 ECN sites across the United Kingdom, most of which have been in operation for more than 15 years. Weather and vegetation datasets were also utilized. Pitfall trap lines were categorized to eight vegetation types. Trend analysis over time was carried out first using all the available dates of capture events, then the datasets grouped by vegetation type and site. Shifts in high-activity periods were also analyzed. P. madidus appearance dates advanced significantly at seven sites and in five vegetation types. Peak activity advanced at two sites. At one site the timing of activity became significantly later. The last day of activity did not change significantly, supporting the theory that the cessation of the activity period is more likely to be controlled by photoperiod than temperature. The relationships between phenological variables and climatic factors were also investigated. However, no significant correlations were detected. These results demonstrate that between 1992 and 2008, phenology of P. madidus at seven sites from the eight analyzed has changed. Global warming may be driving these changes and future work will investigate underlying processes. © 2011 The Authors Journal compilation © Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Black clock beetle; Climate change; Environmental Change Network; Life-history; Long-term data; Trend analysis","Animalia; Carabidae; Coleoptera; Pterostichus madidus",,,,,,"Ahas, R., Long-term phyto-, ornitho- and ichthyophenological time-series analyses in Estonia (1999) International Journal of Biometeorology, 42, pp. 119-123; Bonsal, B.R., Zhang, X., Vincent, L.A., Hogg, W.D., Characteristics of daily and extreme temperatures over Canada (2001) Journal of Climate, 14, pp. 1959-1976; Briers, R.A., Gee, J.H.R., Geoghegan, R., Effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation on growth and phenology of stream insects (2004) Ecography, 27, pp. 811-817; Briggs, J.B., Biology of some ground beetles (Coleoptera Carabidae) injurious to strawberries (1965) Bulletin of Entomological Research, 56, pp. 79-93; Buse, A., Habitat selection and grouping of beetles (Coleoptera) (1988) Holarctic Ecology, 11, pp. 241-247; Butterfield, J., Carabid life-cycle strategies and climate change: A study on an altitude transect (1996) Ecological Entomology, 21, pp. 9-16; Charmantier, A., McCleery, R.H., Cole, L.R., Perrins, C., Kruuk, L.E.B., Sheldon, B.C., Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to climate change in a wild bird population (2008) Science, 320, pp. 800-803; Conrad, K.F., Woiwod, I.P., Parsons, M., Fox, R., Warren, M.S., Long-term population trends in widespread British moths (2004) Journal of Insect Conservation, 8, pp. 119-136; Cotton, P.A., Avian migration phenology and global climate change (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100, pp. 12219-12222; Crick, H.Q.P., Dudley, C., Glue, D.E., Thomson, D.L., UK birds are laying eggs earlier (1997) Nature, 388, p. 526; Durant, J.M., Hjermann, D.O., Anker-Nilssen, T., Beaugrand, G., Mysterud, A., Pettorelli, N., Stenseth, N.C., Timing and abundance as key mechanisms affecting trophic interactions in variable environments (2005) Ecology Letters, 8, pp. 952-958; Eyre, M.D., Rushton, S.P., Luff, M.L., Telfer, M.G., Investigating the relationships between the distribution of British ground beetle species (Coleoptera, Carabidae) and temperature, precipitation and altitude (2005) Journal of Biogeography, 32, pp. 973-983; Forister, M.L., Shapiro, A.M., Climatic trends and advancing spring flight of butterflies in lowland California (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 1130-1135; Gardner, S.M., Ground beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) communities on upland heath and their association with heathland flora (1991) Journal of Biogeography, 18, pp. 281-289; Graham-Taylor, L.G., Stubbs, A.E., Brooke, M.D.E.L., Changes in phenology of hoverflies in a central England garden (2009) Insect Conservation and Diversity, 2, pp. 29-35; Grechanichenko, T., Guseva, N., Carabid communities (Col.
