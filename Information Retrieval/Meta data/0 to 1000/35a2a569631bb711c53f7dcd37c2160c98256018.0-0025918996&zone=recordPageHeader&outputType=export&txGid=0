Increases in greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are expected to increase average surface temperatures and alter precipitation patterns. These changes will alter numerous biochemical processes of vegetative communities. Changes in growth rates, carbon allocation patterns, nutrient cycling, and competitive interactions will lead to direct changes in the structure and species composition of many plant communities. Major shifts in vegetation zones will occur in many regions. Climate change will affect fire potential by influencing the frequency and severity of weather favorable for fire. Climate-driven changes in the structure and composition of plant communities will also affect fire potential by altering the physical and chemical properties of fuels. Changes in timing and severity of fire will modify the rate at which communities respond to climate change. This in turn will alter fuel properties, further modifying fire potential. Changes in fire regimes will directly affect the chemistry of the atmosphere by modifying vegetation and emitting gases and particulate matter. The expected rate and magnitude of these changes raises questions for the continued integrity, vitality, and stability of current ecosystems. © 1991.",,"climatic change; fire; article; climate; ecology; ecosystem; fire; meteorology; plant",,,,,,"Arno, Forest fire history in the Northern Rockies (1980) J.
