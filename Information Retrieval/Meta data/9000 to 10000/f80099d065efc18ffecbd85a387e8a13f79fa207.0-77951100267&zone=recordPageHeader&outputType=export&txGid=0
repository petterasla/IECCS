The effect of scale and transportation of raw materials and products was investigated, as well as the effect of ploughing grassland and using irrigation to grow oil crops. This research shows that the GWP and fossil-energy requirements of biodiesel produced in South Africa vary widely, depending upon predominantly the crop yield, the requirement for irrigation, and the ploughing of uncultivated land. For the best case scenario, where no uncultivated land is newly ploughed and irrigation is not required, biodiesel has a GWP 20-36% lower than that of the fossil diesel mix currently used in South Africa and a fossil-energy requirement 50-62% lower. However, in the worst case scenario, where oil-seed crops are grown on newly cultivated land requiring substantial irrigation, this paper concludes that biodiesel can have a GWP significantly higher than South African fossil diesel. The scale of operation and transport distances involved are shown to have little influence on the GWP and fossil-energy requirement of biodiesel produced in South Africa. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Biodiesel production; Crop yield; Cultivated lands; Energy requirements; Global warming potential; Life-cycle assessments; Oil crops; Oil seed rape; Seed crop; South Africa; Sunflower oil; Transport distances; Worst case scenario; Crops; Global warming; Irrigation; Life cycle; Materials handling; Petroleum transportation; Vegetable oils; Biodiesel",,,,,,"Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2003) Off.
