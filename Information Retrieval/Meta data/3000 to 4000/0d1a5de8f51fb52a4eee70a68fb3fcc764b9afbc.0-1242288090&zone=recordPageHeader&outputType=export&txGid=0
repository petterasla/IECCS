We present an analysis of the role of climate and other factors in determining metapopulation structure based on presence and absence data. We compared existing and historical population distributions of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) to determine whether regional climate patterns were correlated with local extinction. To examine all mountain ranges known to hold or to have held desert bighorn populations in California and score for variables describing climate, metapopulation dynamics, human impacts, and other environmental factors, we used a geographic information system (GIS) and paper maps. We used logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning to assess the relationship among these variables and the current status of each population (extinct or extant). Parameters related to climate - elevation, precipitation, and presence of dependable springs - were strongly correlated with population persistence in the twentieth century. Populations inhabiting lower, drier mountain ranges were more likely to go extinct. The presence of domestic sheep grazing allotments was negatively correlated with population persistence. We used conditional extinction probabilities generated by the logistic-regression model to rank native, naturally recolonized, and reintroduced populations by vulnerability to extinction under several climate-change scenarios. Thus risk of extinction in metapopulations can be evaluated for global-climate-change scenarios even when few demographic data are available.","Climate change; Extinction; Hierarchical partitioning; Metapopulation; Ovis canadensis","climate change; extinction; GIS; persistence; sheep; temperature; California; North America; United States; Ovis aries; Ovis canadensis",,,,,,"Andrew, N.G., Bleich, V.C., August, P.V., Torres, S.G., Demography of mountain sheep in the East Chocolate Mountains, California (1997) California Fish and Game, 83, pp. 68-77; Andrew, N.G., Bleich, V.C., August, P.V., Habitat selection by mountain sheep in the Sonoran desert: Implications for conservation in the United States and Mexico (1999) California Wildlife Conservation Bulletin 12, , California Department of Fish and Game, Sacramento; Andrewartha, H.G., Birch, L.C., (1954) The Distribution and Abundance of Animals, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Ball, R., North America (1998) The Regional Impacts of Climate Change: An Assessment of Vulnerability, pp. 255-332. , R.
