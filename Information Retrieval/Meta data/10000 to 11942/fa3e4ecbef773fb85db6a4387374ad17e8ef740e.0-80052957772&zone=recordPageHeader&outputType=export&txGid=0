Gas produces approximately half the amount of CO 2 per unit of primary energy compared with coal. Here we consider a scenario where a fraction of coal usage is replaced by natural gas (i. e., methane, CH 4) over a given time period, and where a percentage of the gas production is assumed to leak into the atmosphere. The additional CH 4 from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in CO 2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. We also consider the effects of: methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced CO 2 emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbonaceous aerosol; Climate system; Coal mining; Electricity production; Fossil fuel combustion; Gas productions; Gas-fired; Global-mean temperature; Leakage rates; Methane leakage; Per unit; Primary energies; Radiative forcings; Time-periods; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Electric power generation; Fuels; Gas emissions; Methane; Natural gas; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Coal combustion",,,,,,"Clarke, L.E., Edmonds, J.A., Jacoby, H.D., Pitcher, H., Reilly, J.M., Richels, R., Scenarios of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Atmospheric Concentrations.
