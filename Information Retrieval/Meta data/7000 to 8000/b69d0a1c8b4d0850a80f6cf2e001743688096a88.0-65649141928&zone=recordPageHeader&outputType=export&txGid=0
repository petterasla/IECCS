Feeding by the balsam woolly adelgid is restricted to Abies species in which it causes gouting, branch and upper crown death. Approximately 100 years after its introduction into eastern Canada, symptoms of feeding by the balsam woolly adelgid on balsam fir are found throughout all of Nova Scotia, most of Newfoundland and in southern and eastern New Brunswick. The distribution of symptomatic balsam fir trees coincides with areas where mean January temperatures are below -11°C and where plant hardiness zones are higher than 4a. The presence of balsam fir trees with obvious symptoms of BWA damage throughout much of Atlantic Canada emphasizes the ubiquitous presence of this pest in these provinces and highlights the need to develop hazard rating systems to establish pest management programs to diminish its impact.","Abiotic factors; Adelges piceae Ratz.; Forest insect pest management; Global warming","Abies species; Abiotic factors; Adelges piceae Ratz.; Balsam fir; Forest insect pest management; Forest management; Hardiness zone; Hazard rating; Newfoundlands; Nova Scotia; Pest management; Feeding; Global warming; Forestry; cold tolerance; evergreen tree; forest management; global warming; insect; pest control; pest damage; symptom; temperature effect; Abies Amabilis; Canada; Feeding; Forests; Insects; Pest Control; Atlantic Coast [Canada]; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Canada; North America; Abies; Abies balsamea; Adelges piceae; Adelgidae; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Balch, R.E., The balsam woolly aphid, Adelges piceae (Ratz.) in Canada (1932) Sci.
