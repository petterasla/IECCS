The main contribution of motor vehicles comes from the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study aims to identify the factors affecting the preferences for vehicle fuel types in Turkey. To meet this objective, a survey was conducted with 1983 participants in different regions of Turkey by the DataProfil survey firm. Results obtained from a multinomial logit model show that variables such as gender, attitudes towards alternative energy sources, social responsibility and sensitivity to environmental problems have an impact on preference of vehicle fuel type.
