Global climate change coupled with local attributes is eroding the coasts of the world in alarming proportions. Most of the conventional protection methods are hard, short lived, expensive and not eco-friendly. Trend in coastal erosion mitigation and protection has been shifting these days towards soft but novel, eco-friendly methods. Pro-active methods are being developed and used which are eco-friendly, construction-friendly, cheaper and which also reasonably address the root cause of the problem without much 'side effects'. Many non-traditional ways to armor, stabilize or restore beaches, including the use of patented precast concrete units, geotextile sand-filled bags, green belts, bio-engineering, sand fencing, beach-face dewatering systems, integrated costal protection methods are being used. Retreat from the coast is also thought about, in many circles. Present study consists the global coastal erosion scenario and also some of the state of the art soft and pro-active erosion mitigation methods.","Artificial reef; Beach erosion; Coastal erosion; Geotextiles; Green belt; Sand fencing; Soft and hard options","beach erosion; bioengineering; climate change; coastal protection; geotextile; greenbelt; mitigation",,,,,,"(2007) IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change, , IPCC; (2010) Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment Report, , Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR); (2010) United States Environment Protection Agency Web Site, Climate Change - Science, , USEPA, accessed on 02.04; Sin-Iti, I., Wataru, S., Tomonori, M., Past evaluation and future projection of sea level rise related to climate change around Japan (2008) Journal of Disaster Research, 3 (2), pp. 119-120; Nayak, S.R., (2010) Plenary Talk ""Earth System Science: A Perspective"", , (97th Indian Science Congress, Thiruvananthapuram); Bird, E.C.F., (1985) Coastline Changes, p. 246. , (Wiley & Sons, New York); Bilan, D., (1993) The Preliminary Vulnerability Assessment of the Chinese Coastal Zone Due to Sea Level Rise, , (Proceedings of the IPCC eastern hemisphere workshop, Tsukuba, Japan) August 3-6; Ibe, A.C., (1988) Coastline Erosion in Nigeria, Ibadan, p. 217. , (University Press, Ibadan, Nigeria), ISBN: 978 2345041; Singh, B., Climate-related global changes in the southern Caribbean: Trinidad and Tobago (1997) Global and Planetary Change, 15 (3-4), pp. 93-111; (2005) Global Warming: Problems and Policies, p. 304. , Gupta K R, (Ed.), (Atlantic Publishers and Distributors, New Delhi); (2008) Liberia: Coastal Erosion Displaces Hundreds, , http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/48440538e.html, Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), 28 May, accessed on 3 April 2010); Hegde, A.V., (2004) Lecture Presentation Made at NITK, Surathkal; http://www.surfrider.org/a-z/managed_retreat.phpCat, N.N., Tien, P.H., Do Dinh, S., Binh, N.N., (2005) Status of Coastal Erosion of Vietnam and Proposed Measures for Protection, , http://www.fao.org/forestry/11286-1-0.pdf; http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/SEAGRANT/CEaBLiH.html(2009) An Assessment of Post Tsunami Restoration and Conservation Initiatives in Coastal Stretch of Matara, , IUCN, IUCNSri Lanka Country Office, Ecosystems & Livelihoods Group, Asia; Restall, S.J., Jackson, L.A., Georg, H., Hornsey, W.P., Case studies showing the growth and development of geotextile sand containers: An Australian perspective (2002) Geotextiles and Geomembranes, 20 (5), pp. 321-342; (2003) Shore Protection Projects, pp. V-3-80-V-3-86. , Coastal Engineering Manual, Chapter 3, (US Army Corps of Engineers, Washington DC, EM 1110-2-1100, Part V); http://www.surfrider.org/a-z/managed_retreat.php","Hegde, A.
