The dry ecosystem responds sensitively to water-heat pattern of global change there. The distribution pattern and productivity of terrestrial ecosystem are greatly affected by global warming. Ecological adaptation strategies of seedlings of Caragana intermedia Kuang et H. C. Fu, Hedysarum mongolicum Turcz, and Artemisia ordosica Kraschen., three dominant shrubs in Ordas plateau, were investigated in terms of morphological plasticities, biomass effects and photosynthetic and physiological characters, to the global warming by artificially controlling two temperature levels. The results show that the effects of temperature enhancement on growth and photosynthetic and physiological characters were obviously different among these three plant species. Temperature enhancement significantly increased tree height, leaf number, leaf area, biomass, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of C. intermedia and H. mongolicum seedlings, indicating that elevated temperature significantly affected the growth of these seedlings positively. Elevated temperature had almost no significant effect on the growth of A. ordosica seedlings. Their leaf number, leaf size, leaf area, biomass, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance did not increase obviously, but tree height and photosynthetic rate obviously increased with increasing temperature. Interspecific growth was significantly different among C. intermedia, H. mongolicum and A. ordosica seedlings. Except leaf size, values of the other seven characters of C. intermedia seedlings were greater than those of H. mongolicum and A. ordosica seedlings.","Dominant shrubs; Ecological adaptation; Global warming; Ordos plateau; Semi-arid area","adaptation; global warming; productivity; semiarid region; shrub; spatial distribution; China; Artemisia ordosica; Caragana intermedia; Hedysarum mongolicum",,,,,,"Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, J.T., (1990) The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
