There are significant discrepancies in the reported integrated infrared (IR) absorption cross section of CF 4 leading to uncertainty in its contribution to climate change. To reduce this uncertainty, the IR spectrum of CF4 was measured in two different laboratories, in 0-933 hPa of air diluent at 296 ± 2K over the wavelength range 600-3700 cm-1 using spectral resolutions of 0.03 or 0.50 cm-1. There was no discernable effect of diluent gas pressure or spectral resolution on the integrated IR absorption, and a value of the integrated absorption cross section of (1.90 ± 0.17) × 10-16 cm-2 molecule -1 cm-1 was derived. The radiative efficiency (radiative forcing per ppbv) and GWP (relative to CO 2) of CF4 were calculated to be 0.102 W m -2 ppbv-1 and 7200 (100 year time horizon). The GWP for CF4 calculated herein is approximately 30% greater than that given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [2002] partly due to what we believe to be an erroneously low value for the IR absorption strength of CF4 assumed in the calculations adopted by the IPCC. The radiative efficiency of CF 4 is predicted to decrease by up to 40% as the CF 4 forcing starts to saturate and overlapping absorption by CH4, H2O, and N2O in the atmosphere increases over the period 1750-2100. The radiative forcing attributable to increased CF4 levels in the atmosphere from 1750 to 2000 is estimated to be 0.004 W m-2 and is predicted to be up to 0.033 W m-2 from 2000 to 2100, dependent on the scenario.
