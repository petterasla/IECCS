Here, we show that over a 30-year period in the Ross Sea, average weaning masses of Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, varied strongly among years and were correlated to large-scale climatic and oceanographic variations. Foraging success of pregnant seals (reflected by weaning mass the following pupping season) increased during summers characterized by reduced sea-ice cover and positive phases of the southern oscillation. These results demonstrate a correlation between environmental variation and an important life history characteristic (weaning mass) of an Antarctic marine mammal. Understanding the mechanisms that link climatic variation and animal life history characteristics will contribute to understanding both population dynamics and global climatic processes. For the world's most southerly distributed mammal species, the projected trend of increasing global climate change raises concern because increasing sea-ice trends in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica will likely reduce populations due to reduced access to prey as expressed through declines in body condition and reproductive performance. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Antarctica; Climatic variation; El Nino southern oscillation; Leptonychotes weddellii; Sea-ice extent; Weddell seal","climate effect; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global climate; ice cover; life history; marine ecosystem; pinniped; polar region; population distribution; population dynamics; predator; weaning; Antarctica; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean; Animalia; Leptonychotes weddellii; Mammalia",,,,,,"Ainley, D.J., The Ross Sea, Antarctica, where all ecosystem processes still remain for study, but maybe not for long (2003) Mar Ornithol, 31, pp. 1-16; Ainley, D.G., Wilson, P.R., Barton, K.J., Ballard, G., Nur, N., Karl, B., Diet and foraging effort of Adelie penguins in relation to pack-ice conditions in the southern Ross Sea (1998) Polar Biol, 20, pp. 311-9; Arnbom, T., Fedak, M.A., Boyd, I.L., Factors affecting maternal expenditure in southern elephant seals during lactation (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 471-83; Arrigo, K.R., Van Dijken, G.L., Annual changes in sea-ice, chlorophyll a, and primary production in the Ross Sea, Antarctica (2004) Deep Sea Res II, 51, pp. 117-38; Arrigo, K.R., Worthen, D.L., Schnell, A., Lizotte, M.P., Primary production in southern ocean waters (1998) J Geophys Res Oceans, 103, pp. 15587-600; Baker, J.D., Fowler, C.W., Pup weight and survival of northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus (1992) J Zool (London), 227, pp. 231-8; Barbraud, C., Weimerskirch, H., Emperor penguins and climate change (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 183-6; Bowen, W.D., Ellis, S.L., Iverson, S.J., Boness, D.J., Maternal Effects on Offspring Growth Rate and Weaning Mass in Harbor Seals (2001) Can J Zool, 79, pp. 1088-101; Bruggeman, J.E., Garrott, R.A., Bjornlie, D.D., White, P.J., Watson, F.G.R., Temporal variability in winter travel patterns of Yellowstone bison: The effects of road grooming (2006) Ecol Appl, , (in press); (2005) Southern Oscillation Index Archives, 1976 to Present, , http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/, Australian Government; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , 2 Springer Science and Business Media, Inc New York; Burns, J.M., Trumble, S.J., Castellini, M.A., Testa, J.W., The diet of Weddell seals in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica as determined from scat collections and stable isotope analysis (1998) Polar Biology, 19, pp. 272-82; Cameron, M.F., Siniff, D.B., Age-specific survival, abundance, and immigration rates of a Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) population in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica (2004) Can J Zool, 82, pp. 601-15; Castellini, M.A., Davis, R.W., Kooyman, G.L., Annual cycles of diving behavior and ecology of the Weddell seal (1992) Bull Scripps Inst Oceanogr, 28, pp. 1-54; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Price, O.F., Albin, S.D., Jewell, P.A., Early development and population fluctuations in Soay Sheep (1992) J Anim Ecol, 61, pp. 381-96; Comiso, J.C., (1999) Bootstrap Sea-ice Concentrations for NIMBUS-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I, 1978-2003, , updated National Snow and Ice Data Center, Boulder, CO, USA; Craig, M.P., Ragen, T.J., Body size, survival, and decline of juvenile Hawaiian monk seals, Monachus schauinslandi (1999) Mar Mamm Sci, 15, pp. 786-809; Crocker, D.E., Williams, J.D., Costa, D.P., Le Boeuf, B.J., Maternal traits and reproductive effort in northern elephant seals (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 3541-55; Croxall, J.P., Southern ocean environmental changes: Effects on seabird, seal and whale populations (1992) Philos Trans R Soc Lond B, 338, pp. 319-28; Croxall, J.P., Trathan, P.N., Murphy, E.J., Environmental change and Antarctic seabird populations (2002) Science, 297, pp. 1510-4; Domack, E., Duran, D., Leventer, A., Ishman, S., Doane, S., McCallum, S., Amblas, D., Prentice, M., Stability of the Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula during the Holocene epoch (2005) Nature, 436, pp. 681-5; Doran, P.T., Priscu, J., Lyons, W.B., Walsh, J.E., Fountain, A.G., McKnight, D.M., Moorhead, D.L., Parsons, A.N., Antarctic climate cooling and terrestrial ecosystem response (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 517-20; Franklin, A.B., Anderson, D.R., Gutierrez, R.J., Burnham, K.P., Climate, habitat quality, and fitness in northern spotted owl populations in northwestern California (2000) Ecol Monogr, 70, pp. 539-90; Fraser, W.R., Trivelpiece, W.Z., Ainley, D.G., Trivelpiece, S.G., Increases in Antarctic penguin populations: Reduced competition with whales or a loss of sea-ice due to environmental warming?
