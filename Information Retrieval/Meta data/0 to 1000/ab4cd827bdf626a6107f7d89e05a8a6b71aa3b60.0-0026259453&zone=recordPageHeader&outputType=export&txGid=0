The projection suggests that fossil-fuel consumption, not deforestation, will be the major source of emissions during 1990-2011. By the year 2011, energy-efficiency improvement measures could bring about a 14% reduction of CO2 emissions. Any reduction beyond this level would require switches of fuel mix in the power, transportation, and industrial sectors. Fuel shifts in the power sector alone could cut emissions by up to 20% to 30%. In the longer run, Thailand should consider adopting unconventional sources of energy, as well as make use of reforestation policy to absorb future CO2 emissions. © 1991.",,"Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide - Environmental Impact; Energy Conservation; Energy Management; Greenhouse Effect; Carbon Dioxide Emissions; Emission Reduction; Energy Consumption; Fossil Fuel Consumption; Global Climate Change; Energy Policy",,,,,,"Department of Industrial Works, (1988) O3 CFCs and Montreal Protocol, , Bangkok, Thailand; The World Resources Institute, (1990) World Resources 1990–1991, , Oxford University, UK; Florentin, Bach, Koomey, Energy Policy in the Greenhouse (1989) International Project for Sustainable Energy Paths, , El Cerrito, CA; Chongpeerapien, Sungsuwan, Kritiporn, Buranasajja, Resource Management Associates, (1990) Energy and Environment: Choosing the Right Mix, , Thailand Development Research Institute, Bangkok; British Petroleum, (1990) BP Statistical Review of World Energy, , Corporated Communications Services, England; BP Gas International Limited, (1990) Thailand LNG: Preliminary Project Study, , British Petroleum Development, Thailand; (1990) Policymakers Summary of the Potential Impacts of Climate Change, , El Cerrito, CA; National Energy Policy Office, (1989) Energy Policy Journal, (9)","Patanavanich, S.",,,,,,,,03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026259453
