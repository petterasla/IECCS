These costly, hazardous, and polluting wet chemicals are then disposed of through environmentally unfriendly waste-disposal processes, often contributing to global warming, substantial energy consumption, ground water contamination, etc. A new cleaning process (ENVIRO) that dry ashes etched resist and simultaneously renders remaining material 100% DI water soluble has been qualified in manufacturing and successfully used for more than 12 months. Normalized for a 10,000 water-starts/week fab, this process can save more than $5 million/year in solvent costs alone.",,"Amines; Dry etching; Environmental impact; Free radicals; Ion implantation; Plasmas; Solvents; Waste disposal; Water; Dry ashes; Dry ashing; Solvent free stripping; Via veils; Photoresists",,,,,,"Mocala, K., Characterization, properties and analysis of via veils The Electrochemical Society Proceedings, 95 (20), pp. 395-400; Singer, P., Plasma ashing moves into the mainstream (1996) Semiconductor International, 83. , Aug; Bersin, R.L., Residue-free dry stripping photoresist without solvents or acids: Time for a paradigm shift Semiconductor Fabtech, Sixth Edition, pp. 341-347; Weling, M., Harvey, I., Optimization of a deep sub-micron via etch and strip process stopping on TiN The Electrochemical Society Proceedings, 96 (12), pp. 435-443; note","Bersin, R.; ULVAC Technologies Inc., Methuen, MA, United States",,,,,,,,0038111X,,SSTEA,,"English","Solid State Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035311822
