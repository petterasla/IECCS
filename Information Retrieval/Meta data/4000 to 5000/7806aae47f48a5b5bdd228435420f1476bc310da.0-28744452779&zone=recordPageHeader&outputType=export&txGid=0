Therefore, in the present investigation, calculations for solubility and dissolution behavior of liquid CO2 droplets released at 1000 m and 1500 m deep in the ocean from a moving ship and a fixed pipeline have been carried out in order to estimate the CO2 dissolution characteristics in the ocean. The results show liquid CO2 becomes CO2 bubble at around 500 m in depth, and the solubility of seawater is about 5% less than of pure water. Also, it is shown that the injection of liquid CO2 from a moving ship is a more effective method for dissolution than from a fixed pipeline, and the presence of hydrate on liquid CO2 acts as a resistant layer in dissolving liquid CO2.","Co2 Sequestration; Global Warming; Hydrate, dissolution; Solubility",,,,,,,"Aya, I., Yamane, K., Yamada, N., Stability of clathrate-hydrate of carbon dioxide in highly pressurized water (1992) ASME HTD, 215, pp. 17-22; Clift, R., Grace, J.R., Weber, M.E., (1978) Bubbles, Drops and Particles, pp. 97-125. , Academic Press; Fujioka, Y., Ozaki, M., Takeuchi, K., Shindo, Y., Herzog, H.J., Cost comparison in various CO2 ocean disposal option (1997) Energy Convers.
