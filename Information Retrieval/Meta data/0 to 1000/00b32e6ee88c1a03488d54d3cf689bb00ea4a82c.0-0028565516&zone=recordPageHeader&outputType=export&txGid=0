We conclude that despite an order 5 K warming of the tropical Pacific, and order 50% increase in time-mean atmospheric water vapor under 4×CO2 conditions, ENSO-like SST fluctuations in the coupled model do not intensify, but rather decrease slightly in amplitude. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide increase; El Nino/Southern Oscillation; global warming; ocean/atmosphere model; water vapour; wind anomaly; Pacific",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028565516
