Using these data together with a detailed photochemical model, it is shown that the lifetime of this gas in the sunlit atmosphere is less than a day. The chemistry of iodine in the stratosphere is evaluated, and it is shown that any iodine that reaches the stratosphere will be very effective for ozone destruction there. However, the extremely short lifetime of CF3I greatly limits its transport to the stratosphere when released at the surface, especially at midlatitudes, and the total anthropogenic surface release of CF3I is likely to be far less than that of natural iodocarbons such as CH3I on a global basis. -from Authors",,"fluorocarbon; global warming; iodine; Lalon substitute; ozone depletion; photochemical model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028553553
