It is recognised that evaporative cooling systems offer a low energy alternative to conventional air conditioning units. Recently emerged dew point cooling, as the renovated evaporative cooling configuration, is claimed to have much higher cooling output over the conventional evaporative modes owing to use of the M-cycle heat exchangers. Cross-flow and counter-flow heat exchangers, as the available structures for M-cycle dew point cooling processing, were theoretically and experimentally investigated to identify the difference in cooling effectiveness of both under the parallel structural/operational conditions, optimise the geometrical sizes of the exchangers and suggest their favourite operational conditions. Through development of a dedicated computer model and case-by-case experimental testing and validation, a parametric study of the cooling performance of the counter-flow and cross-flow heat exchangers was carried out. The results showed the counter-flow exchanger offered greater (around 20% higher) cooling capacity, as well as greater (15%-23% higher) dew-point and wet-bulb effectiveness when equal in physical size and under the same operating conditions. The cross-flow system, however, had a greater (10% higher) Energy Efficiency (COP). As the increased cooling effectiveness will lead to reduced air volume flow rate, smaller system size and lower cost, whilst the size and cost are the inherent barriers for use of dew point cooling as the alternation of the conventional cooling systems, the counter-flow system is considered to offer practical advantages over the cross-flow system that would aid the uptake of this low energy cooling alternative. In line with increased global demand for energy in cooling of building, largely by economic booming of emerging developing nations and recognised global warming, the research results will be of significant importance in terms of promoting deployment of the low energy dew point cooling system, helping reduction of energy use in cooling of buildings and cut of the associated carbon emission. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Counter-flow; Cross-flow; Dew point cooling; Evaporative cooling; M-cycle; Numerical simulation","Counter-flow; Cross flows; Dew points; Evaporative cooling; M-cycle; Computer simulation; Cooling; Energy efficiency; Evaporation; Global warming; Heat exchangers; Thermoelectric equipment; Evaporative cooling systems; air conditioning; airflow; building; comparative study; control system; cooling; numerical model; performance assessment; theoretical study; volume",,,,,,"Luis Perez-Lombard, J.O., Pout, C., A review on buildings energy consumption information (2008) Energy and Buildings, 40 (3), pp. 394-398; (2006) Energy information administration, , International Energy Outlook, U.S. Department of Energy; (2006) Key world energy statistics, , International Energy Agency; Kottek, M., Grieser, J., Beck, C., Rudolf, B., Rubel, F., World map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification update (2006) Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 15 (3), pp. 259-263; (2011), http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw, Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), Columbia University; and Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). 2005 Gridded Population of the World Version 3 (GPWv3): Population Density Grids.
