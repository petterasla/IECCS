We have investigated the behaviour of liquid CO2 using test facilities which can simulate the pressure and temperature of the deep ocean. Phase equilibrium data of the CO2-seawater system and the conditions of CO2 clathrate formation were confirmed. In addition,we measured the pH value of seawater saturated with CO2 at high pressure. The data presented in this paper are considered indispensable for evaluating the possibility of CO2 disposal in the deep ocean. © 1994 IEEE","Co2; Co2 clathrate; equilibrium; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse effect; seawater","Fossil fuels; Global warming; Green's function; Marine pollution; Ocean dumping; pH; Phase equilibria; Seawater; Carbon dioxide clathrate formation; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Nishikawa, N., CO2 Clathrate Formation and its Properties in the Simulated Deep Ocean (1992) Energy Convers.
