The model was then applied to a cool-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest in Takayama, central Japan (36°08′N, 137°25′E, 1420 m above sea level). Simulations were conducted at a daily time step from 1948 to 2008, using time-series meteorological and nitrogen deposition data. VISIT accurately captured the carbon and nitrogen cycles of this typical Japanese forest, as validated by tower and chamber flux measurements. During the last 10 years of the simulation, the model estimated that the forest was a net greenhouse gas sink, having a GWP equivalent of 1025.7 g CO 2 m -2 y -1, most of which (1016.9 g CO 2 m -2 y -1) was accounted for by net CO 2 sequestration into forest biomass regrowth. CH 4 oxidation by the forest soil made a small contribution to the net sink (11.9 g CO 2-eq. m -2 y -1), whereas N 2O emissions were a very small source (3.2 g CO 2-eq. m -2 y -1), as expected for a volcanic soil in a humid climate. Analysis of the sensitivity of GWP to changes in temperature, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition indicated that warming temperatures would decrease the size of the sink, mainly as a result of increased CO 2 release due to increased ecosystem respiration. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Carbon-nitrogen cycle; Global warming; Model evaluation; Nitrogen deposition; Terrestrial feedback; Uncertainty","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biogeochemical cycle; broad-leaved forest; carbon dioxide; climate feedback; deciduous forest; flux chamber; forest soil; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; model test; numerical model; phytomass; radiative forcing; respiration; terrestrial ecosystem; time series; trace gas; uncertainty analysis; Chubu; Gifu; Honshu; Japan; Takayama",,,,,,"Borken, W., Brumme, R., Liming practice in temperate forest ecosystems and the effects on CO 2, N 2O and CH 4 fluxes (1997) Soil Use Manage, 13, pp. 251-257; Bridges, E.M., (1978) World Soils, p. 128. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Cox, P.M., Betts, R.A., Jones, G.D., Spall, S.A., Totterdell, I.J., Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 184-187; Curry, C.L., Modeling the soil consumption of atmospheric methane at the global scale (2007) Glob Biogeochem Cycles, 21, pp. GB4012. , doi:10.1029/2006GB002818; Dalal, R.C., Allen, D.E., Greenhouse gas fluxes from natural ecosystems (2008) Aust J Bot, 56, pp. 369-407; Davidson, E.A., Keller, M., Erickson, H.E., Verchot, L.V., Veldkamp, E., Testing a conceptual model of soil emissions of nitrous and nitric oxides (2000) Bioscience, 50, pp. 667-680; Davidson, E.A., Enpstad, D.C., Ishida, F.Y., Brando, P.M., Effects of an experimental drought and recovery on soil emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and nitric oxide in a moist tropical forest (2008) Glob Change Biol, 14, pp. 2582-2590; Dong, Y., Scharffe, D., Lobert, J.M., Crutzen, P.J., Sanhueza, E., Fluxes of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O from a temperate forest soil: The effects of leaves and humus layers (1998) Tellus, 50 B, pp. 243-252; Fukuzawa, K., Shibata, H., Takagi, K., Nomura, M., Kurima, N., Fukazawa, T., Satoh, F., Sasa, K., Effects of clear-cutting on nitrogen leaching and fine root dynamics in a cool-temperate forested watershed in northern Japan (2006) For Ecol Manage, 225, pp. 257-261; Hahn, M., Gartner, K., Zechmeister-Boltenstern, S., Greenhouse gas emissions (N 2O, CO 2 and CH 4) from three forest soils near Vienna (Austria) with different water and nitrogen regimes (2000) Bodenkultur, 51, pp. 115-125; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, p. 892. , IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, p. 1008. , IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ishijima, K., Nakazawa, T., Aoki, S., Variations of atmospheric nitrous oxide concentration in the northern and western Pacific (2009) Tellus, 61 B, pp. 408-415; Ishizuka, S., Sakata, T., Ishizuka, K., Methane oxidation in Japanese forest soils (2000) Soil Biol Biochem, 32, pp. 769-777; Ito, A., Oikawa, T., A simulation model of the carbon cycle in land ecosystems (Sim-CYCLE): A description based on dry-matter production theory and plot-scale validation (2002) Ecol Model, 151, pp. 147-179; Ito, A., Saigusa, N., Murayama, S., Yamamoto, S., Modeling of gross and net carbon dioxide exchange over a cool-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest in Japan: Analysis of seasonal and interannual change (2005) Agric For Meteorol, 134, pp. 122-134; Ito, A., Muraoka, H., Koizumi, H., Saigusa, N., Murayama, S., Yamamoto, S., Seasonal variation in leaf properties and ecosystem carbon budget in a cool-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest: Simulation analysis at Takayama site, Japan (2006) Ecol Res, 21, pp. 137-149; Ito, A., Inatomi, M., Mo, W., Lee, M., Koizumi, H., Saigusa, N., Murayama, S., Yamamoto, S., Examination of model-estimated ecosystem respiration using flux measurements from a cool-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest in central Japan (2007) Tellus B, 59, pp. 616-624; Jia, S., Akiyama, T., Mo, W., Inatomi, M., Koizumi, H., Temporal and spatial variation of soil respiration in a cool temperate broad leaved forest: 1.
