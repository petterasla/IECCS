Droughts may help limit elephant numbers, but they are generally both episodic and local. To explore more general impacts of rainfall, we examine how its annual variation influences elephant survival across ten sites. These sites span an almost coast-to-coast transect of southern Africa that holds the majority of the ~500,000 remaining savanna elephants. Elephants born in high rainfall years survive better than elephants born in low rainfall years. The relationship is generally weak, except at the two fenced sites, where rainfall greatly influenced juvenile survival. In these two sites, there are also extensive networks of artificial water. Rainfall likely affects elephant survival through its influence on food. The provision of artificial water opens new areas for elephants in the dry season, while fencing restricts their movements in the wet season. We conclude that the combination of these factors makes elephant survival more susceptible to reductions in rainfall. As a result, elephants living in enclosed reserves may be the first populations to feel the impacts of global warming which will decrease average rainfall and increase the frequency of droughts. A way to prevent these elephants from damaging the vegetation within these enclosed parks is for managers to reduce artificial water sources or, whenever practical, to remove fences. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Elephants; Fences; Global warming; Loxodonta africana; Rainfall; Survival; Water provision","climate effect; drought stress; elephant; habitat management; nature reserve; plant-herbivore interaction; population dynamics; precipitation intensity; savanna; survival; water availability; Southern Africa; Elephantidae; Loxodonta africana",,,,,,"Barnes, M.E., Effects of large herbivores and fire on the regeneration of Acacia erioloba woodlands in Chobe National Park, Botswana (2001) Afr J Ecol, 39, pp. 340-350; Ben-Shahar, R., Patterns of elephant damage to vegetation in northern Botswana (1993) Biol Cons, 65, pp. 249-256; Bonenfant, C., Gaillard, J.M., Coulson, T., Festa-Bianchet, M., Loison, A., Garel, M., Loe, L.E., Duncan, P., Empirical evidence of density-dependence in populations of large herbivores (2009) Adv Ecol Res, 41, pp. 313-357; Brits, J., van Rooyen, M.W., van Rooyen, N., Ecological impact of large herbivores on the woody vegetation at selected watering points on the eastern basaltic soils in the Kruger National Park (2002) Afr J Ecol, 40, pp. 53-60; Chamaillé-Jammes, S., Valeix, M., Fritz, H., Managing heterogeneity in elephant distribution: Interactions between elephant population density and surface-water availability (2007) J Appl Ecol, 44, pp. 625-633; Chamaillé-Jammes, S., Fritz, H., Valeix, M., Murindagomo, F., Colbert, J., Resource variability, aggregation and direct density dependence in an open context: The local regulation of an African elephant population (2008) J Anim Ecol, 77, pp. 135-144; Coe, M.J., Cumming, D.H.M., Phillipson, J., Biomass and the production of large African herbivores in relation to rainfall and primary productivity (1976) Oecologia, 22, pp. 341-354; Corfield, T.F., Elephant mortality in Tsavo National Park, Kenya (1973) E Afr Wildl J, 11, pp. 339-368; Cumming, D.H.M., Fenton, M.B., Rautenbach, I.L., Taylor, R.D., Cumming, G.S., Cumming, M.S., Dunlop, J.M., Vr, C., Elephants, woodlands and biodiversity in southern Africa (1997) S Afr J Sci, 93, pp. 231-236; de Beer, Y., van Aarde, R., Do landscape heterogeneity and water distribution explain aspects of elephant home range in southern Africa's arid savannas?
