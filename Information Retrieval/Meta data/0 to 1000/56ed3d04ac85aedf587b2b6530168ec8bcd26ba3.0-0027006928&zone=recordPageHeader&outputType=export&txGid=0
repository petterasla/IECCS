Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to develop, manipulate, and synthesize model input including land cover, digital elevation data, and site characteristics data. The SLAMM3 model evaluated the input data to predict responses of coastal wetlands and lowlands to inundation and erosion by sea level rise, and determined transfers from one habitat to another on a cell-by-cell basis. -from Authors",,"coastal wetland; GIS; impact; impact modelling; modeling; remote sensing; sea level rise; sea-level rise; wetland; USA, Florida; USA, Florida, Atlantic Coast; Coastal zones; Information retrieval systems; Remote sensing; Simulation; Geographic information system; Geoprocessing; Northeast Florida; Oceanography",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027006928
