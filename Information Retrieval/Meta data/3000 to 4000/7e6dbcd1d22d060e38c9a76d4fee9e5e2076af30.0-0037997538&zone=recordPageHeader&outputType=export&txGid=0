The difference between Turkey's total primary energy supply (TPES) of from its own sources and total final consumption (TFC) is projected grow from 1 quad (1.06-2.06) in 1999 to 5.71 quads (2.79-8.5) in 2020 (1 quad=293.071 TWh). Turkey's limited amount of fossil fuels has a present average ratio of proved reserves of 97.38 quads to production rate of 3.2 quads yr-1 of about 30 years. Turkey's reliance on fossil fuel-based energy systems to meet the growing demand is most likely to exacerbate the issues of energy insecurity, national environmental degradation, and global climate change in increasing proportions. Economically-feasible renewable energy potential in Turkey is estimated at a total of ca. 1.69 quads yr-1 (495.4 TWh yr-1) with the potential for 0.67 quads yr-1 (196.7 TWh yr-1) of biomass energy, 0.42 quads yr-1 (124 TWh yr-1) of hydropower, 0.35 quads yr-1 (102.3 TWh yr-1) of solar energy, 0.17 quads yr-1 (50 TWh yr-1) of wind energy, and 0.08 quads yr-1 (22.4 TWh yr-1) of geothermal energy. Pursuit and implementation of sustainability-based energy policy could provide about 90 and 35% of Turkey's total energy supply and consumption projected in 2010, respectively. Utilization of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation would necessitate about 23.2 Mha (29.8%) of Turkey's land resources. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.
