The NAOI (January and February) and the SOI (April) showed significant inverse and positive relationships respectively with the FCS generated in SM season over the Bay of Bengal. These relationships are marked on a decadal scale. In the Global Warming (GW) era, a significant reduction in the FCS is associated with a significant increase of NAOI, relaxation of SOI and a weak vertical zonal wind shear in the domain 5°-22°N and 80°-100°E. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Frequency of the cyclonic systems; NAOI; SOI; Summer monsoon","Bay of Bengal; Frequency of the cyclonic systems; NAOI; North atlantic oscillation indices; SOI; Southern oscillation index; Summer monsoon; Zonal wind; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Global warming; climate change; decadal variation; North Atlantic Oscillation; Southern Oscillation; wind shear; Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean",,,,,,"Aravequia, J., Rao, V.B., Bonatti, J.P., The role of moist baroclinic instability in the growth and structure of monsoon depressions (1995) J.
