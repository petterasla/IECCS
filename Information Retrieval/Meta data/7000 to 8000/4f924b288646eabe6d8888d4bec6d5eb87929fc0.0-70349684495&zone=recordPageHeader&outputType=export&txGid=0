After the initial discharges into the different environmental media (and the technosphere), there are further 'inter-sphere' leakages or redirections. However, these happen over protracted periods of time and have not been accounted for in this paper. The paper presents a case study on the wastewater treatment plants in the Netherlands, examines how the degree of separation of COD (BOD), nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals from the wastewater have increased over time, and studies the changes in proportions separated out to the atmosphere and lithosphere. The hydrosphere has benefited from a decline in the degree of eutrophication and marine/fresh water toxicity, owing to the favourable combination of higher degrees of separation, over time, and source control, especially in the industrial sector. Global warming is a major concern owing to the increasing conversion of COD to carbon dioxide (and methane). Heavy metal and nitrogen emissions have been curbed thanks to source reduction within industries. Technologies have, of course, enabled some mitigation of the problems associated with atmospheric (global warming and toxicity) and lithospheric (toxicity) pollution, though these are beyond the scope of this paper, which assumes a hypothetical worst-case scenario in this regard for the study period 1993-2005.","BOD; COD; Eutrophication; Heavy metals; Nitrogen; Phosphorus","BOD; COD; Degree of separation; Environmental loads; Environmental media; Higher-degree; Industrial sector; Lithospheric; Material Flow; Netherlands; Nitrogen emissions; Source control; Source reduction; Treatment efficiency; Wastewater treatment plants; Water phase; Worst case scenario; Biochemical oxygen demand; Carbon dioxide; Eutrophication; Global warming; Heavy metals; Metals; Methane; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Research; Separation; Sewage pumping plants; Toxicity; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Water treatment plants; Chemicals removal (water treatment); carbon dioxide; heavy metal; methane; nitrogen; phosphorus; biochemical oxygen demand; discharge; eutrophication; global warming; heavy metal; nitrogen; phosphorus; pollutant removal; separation; technological development; waste facility; waste treatment; wastewater; article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; environmental impact; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; Netherlands; separation technique; waste water management; water pollution; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Industrial Waste; Models, Chemical; Netherlands; Rheology; Soil Pollutants; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Industrial Waste; Soil Pollutants; Water, 7732-18-5; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"www.cbs.nl, Accessed 2008Hwang, J., Hanaki, K., The generation of carbon dioxide in sewage sludge treatment systems: A life cycle assessment (2000) Water Sci.
