To understand forest response to severe drought, we used a mobile rainfall shelter to examine the impact of spring and autumn rainfall exclusion on stomatal (SL) and non-stomatal (NSL) limitations of photosynthesis in a Quercus ilex ecosystem. Spring rainfall exclusion, carried out during increasing atmospheric demand and leaf development, had a larger impact on photosynthesis than autumn exclusion, conducted at a time of mature foliage and decreasing vapour pressure deficit. The relative importance of NSL increased with drought intensity. SL and NSL were equal once total limitation (TL) reached 60%, but NSL greatly exceeded SL during severe drought, with 76% NSL partitioned equally between mesophyll conductance (MCL) and biochemical (BL) limitations when TL reached 100%. Rainfall exclusion altered the relationship between leaf water potential and photosynthesis. In response to severe mid-summer drought stress, An and Vcmax were 75% and 72% lower in the spring exclusion plot than in the control plot at the same pre-dawn leaf water potential. Our results revealed changes in the relationship between photosynthetic parameters and water stress that are not currently included in drought parameterizations for modelling applications. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Maximum carboxylation rate; Mesophyll conductance; Photosynthesis; Rainfall exclusion; Stomatal conductance","water; adaptation; climate change; drought stress; evergreen forest; foliage; leaf; photosynthesis; physiological response; rainfall; stomatal conductance; vapor pressure; article; drought; ecosystem; France; oak; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant stoma; season; Southern Europe; tree; Droughts; Ecosystem; France; Mediterranean Region; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Stomata; Quercus; Seasons; Trees; Water; Mediterranean Region; Ilex; Quercus ilex",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Allard, V., Ourcival, J.M., Rambal, S., Joffre, R., Rocheteau, A., Seasonal and annual variation of carbon exchange in an evergreen Mediterranean forest in southern France (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 714-725; Bernacchi, C.J., Portis, A.R., Nakano, H., Von Caemmerer, S., Long, S.P., Temperature response of mesophyll conductance.
