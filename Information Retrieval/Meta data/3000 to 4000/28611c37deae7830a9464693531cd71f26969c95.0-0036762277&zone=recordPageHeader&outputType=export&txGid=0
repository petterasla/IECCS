Over the past 50 years, approximately one-third of the world's mangrove forests have been lost, but most data show very variable loss rates and there is considerable margin of error in most estimates. Mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource, being important nursery grounds and breeding sites for birds, fish, crustaceans, shellfish, reptiles and mammals; a renewable source of wood; accumulation sites for sediment, contaminants, carbon and nutrients; and offer protection against coastal erosion. The destruction of mangroves is usually positively related to human population density. Major reasons for destruction are urban development, aquaculture, mining and overexploitation for timber, fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Over the next 25 years, unrestricted clear felling, aquaculture, and overexploitation of fisheries will be the greatest threats, with lesser problems being alteration of hydrology, pollution and global warming. Loss of biodiversity is, and will continue to be, a severe problem as even pristine mangroves are species-poor compared with other tropical ecosystems. The future is not entirely bleak. The number of rehabilitation and restoration projects is increasing worldwide with some countries showing increases in mangrove area. The intensity of coastal aquaculture appears to have levelled off in some parts of the world. Some commercial projects and economic models indicate that mangroves can be used as a sustainable resource, especially for wood. The brightest note is that the rate of population growth is projected to slow during the next 50 years, with a gradual decline thereafter to the end of the century. Mangrove forests will continue to be exploited at current rates to 2025, unless they are seen as a valuable resource to be managed on a sustainable basis. After 2025, the future of mangroves will depend on technological and ecological advances in multi-species silviculture, genetics, and forestry modelling, but the greatest hope for their future is for a reduction in human population growth.","Coastal resources; Conservation; Current state; Exploitation; Management; Mangrove forest; Projection","Aquaculture; Biodiversity; Ecology; Forestry; Global warming; Hydrology; Impurities; Sediments; Economic resources; Environmental engineering; carbon; coastal zone management; habitat loss; mangrove; nature-society relations; restoration ecology; aquaculture; breeding method; Crustacea; economic aspect; ecosystem; environmental management; environmental protection; fishery; forestry; greenhouse effect; human; hydrology; mangrove; marine environment; molecular model; nonhuman; nutrient; population growth; review; seashore; sediment; shellfish; technology; Alburnus alburnus; Aves; Crustacea; Mammalia; Reptilia; Rhizophoraceae",,,,,,"Alongi, D.M., (1998) Coastal Ecosystem Processes, , New York, USA: CRC Press: 419 pp; Alongi, D.M., Dixon, P., Mangrove primary production and above- and below-ground biomass in Sawi Bay, southern Thailand (2000) Phuket Marine Biological Center Special Publication, 22, pp. 31-38; Alongi, D.M., Sasekumar, A., Benthic communities (1992) Tropical Mangrove Ecosystems, pp. 137-172. , ed.
