Box 3000, Boulder, CO 80307-3000, United States","Since the late 1980s, scientists and policy makers have devoted considerable attention and resources to the issue of global climate change. Domestic and international policies in response focus primarily on prevention of future climate impacts on society through the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. Academic and political attention is also largely focused on issues of mitigation. Adaptation refers to adjustments in individual, group, and institutional behavior in order to reduce society's vulnerabilities to climate, and thus reduce its impacts. In 1996, the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wrote that adaptation offers a 'very powerful option' for responding to climate change and ought to be viewed as a 'complement' to mitigation efforts. Yet, the IPCC also wrote that 'little attention has been paid to any possible tradeoff between both types of options'. This paper discusses the limitations of mitigation responses and the need for adaptation to occupy a larger role in climate policy.","Adaptation; Climate change policy; Framework Convention; IPCC; Mitigation","adaptation; climate change; environmental policy; policy strategy",,,,,,"Broad, W.J., Debating use of iron as curb of climate: A plan to ease global warming passes an early test at sea (1996) New York Times, , November 12, section B5; Burton, I., Deconstructing adaptation . . . and reconstructing (1994) Delta, 5 (1), pp. 14-15; (1994) Submission of the United States of America Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, , US GPO, Washington, DC; Brunner, R.D., Policy and global change research: A modest proposal (1996) Climatic Change, 32, pp. 121-147; Carter, T.R., Assessing climate change adaptations: The IPCC guidelines (1996) Adapting to Climate Change: An International Perspective, , ed.
