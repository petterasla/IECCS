Wood pellets are a clean renewable fuel and has been considered as one of the substitutes for fossil fuels. In Argentina, large quantities of sawmill residues are still unused and wood pellets production could be seen as both, as an environmental solution and an extra economical benefit. The general aim of this study was to determine the wood pellets production costs and energy consumption under different framework conditions in northeast Argentina. The specific costs of wood pellets for the different scenarios showed relative lower costs comparing to the ones reported in other studies, ranging from 35 to 47 /Mgpellets. Raw material costs represented the main cost factor in the calculation of the total pellets production costs. A lower specific production cost was observed when 50% of the raw material input was wood shavings. The specific electricity consumption per metric ton of pellet was lower in scenarios with higher production rate. Lower heat energy consumption was observed in scenarios that have a mixed raw material input. The most promising framework condition for Northeast Argentina, in terms of costs effectiveness and energy consumption could be acquired with production rates of 6 Mg/h with sawdust and wood shavings as raw material. However, simultaneous increment of the electricity by 50% and raw material price by 100% may increase the specific costs up to 50%. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy consumption; Production costs; Renewable energy; Sensitivity analysis; Wood pellets","Argentina; Cost factors; Economical benefits; Electricity-consumption; Energy consumption; Heat energy; Lower cost; Pellets production; Production cost; Production costs; Production rates; Raw material costs; Raw material prices; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable fuels; Specific cost; Wood pellet; Wood pellets; Wood shavings; Costs; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Ore pellets; Pelletizing; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Wood; Wood fuels; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; economic impact; energy resource; energy use; global warming; industrial emission; production cost; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; wood; Argentina; Cost Analysis; Energy Consumption; Fossil Fuels; Operating Costs; Pelleting; Pellets; Renewable Resources; Sensitivity; Argentina",,,,,,"(2008) REN21, Renewables-global status report-2007 update, , http://www.ren21.net, Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century, Available at, [accessed 02.06.09]; Goldemberg, J., (2000) World energy assessment, p. 508. , United Nations Development Programme, New York, NY, USA; Hall, D.O., Rosillo-Calle, F., Williams, R.H., Woods, J., Biomass for energy: supply prospects (1993) Renewable energy, sources for fuels and electricity, pp. 593-653. , Island Press, Washington, DC, USA, T.B.
