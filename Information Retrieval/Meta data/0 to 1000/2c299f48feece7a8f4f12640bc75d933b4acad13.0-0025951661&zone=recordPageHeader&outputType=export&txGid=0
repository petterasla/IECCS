We consider the response to sea-level changes by the immense amount of gas-hydrate that exists in continental rise sediments, and suggest that the reverse situation may apply - that release of methane trapped in the deep-sea sediments as gas-hydrates may provide a negative feedback to advancing glaciation. Methane is likely to be released from deep-sea gas-hydrates as sea-level falls because methane gas-hydrates decompose with pressure decrease. -from Author",,"climatic warming; deglaciation trigger; glaciation extent; global warming; marine gas hydrate; methane; positive feedback; sea level rise; sea level rising; thermal decomposition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025951661
