Long tide gauge records (75 years minimum) have been examined for past apparent sea level acceleration (i.e., deviation from a purely linear rise) and for indication of how long it might take to detect or verify a predicted future acceleration. For the 80-year period 1905-1985, 23 essentially complete tide gauge records in ten geographic groups are available for analysis. From these there is no evidence for an apparent acceleration in the past 100+ years that is significant either statistically, or in comparison to values associated with global warming. Further, it is shown that tide gauges alone cannot serve as a leading indicator of climate change in less than at least several decades. -from Author",,"climate change; global warming; prediction; sea level; tide gauge record",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009176018
