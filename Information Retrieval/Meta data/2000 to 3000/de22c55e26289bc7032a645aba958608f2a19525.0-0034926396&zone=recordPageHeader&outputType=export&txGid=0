Anthropogenic warming continues to evolve, and various methods are used to study and predict the changes of the global and regional climate. Results derived from GCMs, palaeoclimate reconstructions, and regional climate models differ in detail. An empirical model could be used to predict the spatial pattern of the near-surface air temperature and to narrow the range of regional uncertainties. The idea behind this approach is to study the correlations between regional and global temperature using century-scale meteorological records, and to evaluate the regional pattern of the future climate using regression analysis and the global-mean air temperature as a predictor. This empirical model, however, is only applicable to those parts of the world where regional near-surface air temperature reacts linearly to changes of the global thermal regime. This method and data from a set of approximately 2000 weather stations with continuous century-scale records of the monthly air temperature was applied to develop the empirical map of the regional climate sensitivity. Data analysis indicated that an empirical model could be applied to several large regions of the World, where correlations between local and global air temperature are statistically significant. These regions are the western United States, southern Canada, Alaska, Siberia, southeastern Asia, southern Africa and Australia, where the correlation coefficient is typically above 0.9. The map of regional climate sensitivity has been constructed using calculated coefficients of linear regression between the global-mean and regional annual air temperature. As long as the correlations between the local and global air temperature are close to those in the last several decades, this map provides an effective tool to scale down the projection of the global air temperature to regional level. According to the results of this study, maximum warming at the beginning of the 21st century will take place in the continental parts of North America and Eurasia. The empirical regional climate sensitivity defined here as the response of the mean-annual regional temperature to 1 °C global warming was found to be 5-6 °C in southern Alaska, central Canada, and over the continental Siberia, 3-4 °C on the North Slope of Alaska and western coast of the U.S.A., and 1-2 °C in most of the central and eastern U.S.A. and eastern Canada. Regions with negative sensitivity are located in the southeastern U.S.A., north-western Europe and Scandinavia. The local tendency towards cooling, although statistically confirmed by modern data, could, however, change in the near future.",,"Boreholes; Cooling; Data reduction; Global warming; Regression analysis; Near-surface air temperature; Climatology; air temperature; empirical analysis; global warming; mapping; spatial analysis",,,,,,"Andre, J.C., Royer, L.F., Short-term climatic fluctuations and the interpretation of recent observations in terms of greenhouse effect (1999) C.R.
