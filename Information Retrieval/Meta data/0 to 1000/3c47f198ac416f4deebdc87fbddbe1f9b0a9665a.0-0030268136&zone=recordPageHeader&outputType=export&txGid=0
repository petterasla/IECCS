Among these, CO 2 flooding is a highly attractive alternative. A large amount of CO 2 is being produced by coal-fired power plants in this region. The CO 2 is currently discharged into the atmosphere and could be a major contributor to the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. Thus, the concept of capturing CO 2 and utilizing it as a flooding agent in EOR processes is currently generating much interest among oil, utility and coal companies. We demonstrate how cogeneration concepts, together with process-optimization strategies, help to reduce the CO 2-production cost by utilizing low-pressure steam and waste heat from various sections of the power-generation process. Based on these concepts and strategies, results from this study show that the recovery cost of CO 2 from a coal-fired power plant may range between $0.50 and 2.00/mscf. If the cost is approximately $1.25/mscf, the production cost of a barrel of incremental oil would be less than $18. Therefore, even at today's modest oil prices, there is room for profit to be made operating a CO 2 flood with flue-gas-extracted CO 2. The technical and economical feasibility of the concepts are evaluated and the practical implications for the Saskatchewan resources are discussed.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost accounting; International cooperation; Pilot plants; Recovery; Steam power plants; Carbon dioxide production; Coal-fired power plants; Oil recovery; Coal fired boilers; carbon recovery; coal fired power station; cogeneration; feasibility study; recovery costs; Canada, Saskatchewan",,,,,,"(1989) Boundary Dam CO 2 Extraction Pilot Plant: Final Report, , Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada; (1992) Carbon Dioxide Capture, , IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, London, UK; Tontiwachwuthikul, P., Chan, C.W., Kritpiphat, W., Skoropad, D., Gelowitz, D., Aroonwilas, A., Mourits, F., Ward, L., (1995) Proceedings of the 46th Annual Technical Meeting of the Petroleum Society of CIM, , Paper No. CIM 95-81, Banff, Alberta, Canada May; (1993) CO 2 Disposal Study, , Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Cost analysis of controlling carbon dioxide flue gas emissions from Canadian power utilities (1992) Canada Environmental Protection Service Report Series Public Consultation: Problem Assessment, Control Options PG 92-02, , Oil, Gas and Energy Division, Industrial Programs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Limaye, D.R., (1987) Industrial Cogeneration Applications, , Fairmont Press, Lilburn, GA; Hyland, M.J., Stern, K.M., Wolsky, A.M., Jankowski, D.J., (1985) Petroleum Engineer International, 57, p. 24; Blunt, M., Fayers, F.J., Orr, F.M., (1993) Energy Convers.
