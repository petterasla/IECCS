These unique tropical environments harbor a high diversity of corals, reef invertebrates, fish and other animals and plants. In most taxa, the species diversity of reef-associated organisms is poorly understood. High coral mortality has been associated with natural events such as hurricanes, predator outbreaks and periods of high temperature, but has also resulted from excess nutrients in sewage and from specific pollutants. Reef corals and associated organisms are also threatened by the possibility of global warming which will result in rising sea levels and periods of increased temperature stress, and which may also bring increased storm frequency and intensity. Although the recent extensive episodes of coral bleaching in the Caribbean and E Pacific cannot be causally related to global warming, the close link between bleaching and temperature suggests that global warming will result in severe changes in coral assemblages. Major reef destruction has followed outbreaks of the predatory crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci in the Pacific. Although this is part of a natural disturbance cycle, altered land use patterns and reduction of predators on this seastar by human activities may have increased the severity of outbreaks. Recreational and commercial use of reefs has also increased, and has caused extensive damage. A widespread loss to reef biota is the reduction in fish populations from intense overfishing. Improved understanding of ecological procesess on reefs combined with concerted conservation efforts has managed to protect some extensive areas of reef. -from Author",,"anthropogenic impact; biodiversity; bleaching; conservation; coral reef; coral reefs; crown-of-thorns starfish; global warming; human activity; overfishing; reef; species diversity; Caribbean Sea; Pacific; Acanthaster planci",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00031569,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028571849
