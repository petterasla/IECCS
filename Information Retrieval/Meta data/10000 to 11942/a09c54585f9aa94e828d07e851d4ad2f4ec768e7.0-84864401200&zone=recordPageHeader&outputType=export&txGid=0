Our objective was to investigate the general trends of warming effects on soil respiration. This study used meta-analysis as a means to synthesize data from eight sites with a total of 140 measurements taken from published studies. The results presented here suggest that average soil respiration in forest ecosystems was increased approximately by 22.5% with escalating soil temperatures while soil moisture was decreased by 16.5%. The decline in soil moisture seemed to be offset by the positive effects of increasing temperatures on soil respiration. Therefore, global warming will tend to increase the release of carbon normally stored within forest soils into the atmosphere due to increased respiration.","Forest ecosystem; Meta-analysis; Soil respiration; Soil warming","carbon sequestration; forest ecosystem; forest soil; global warming; meta-analysis; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; temperature effect",,,,,,"Agren, G.I., Bosatta, E., Reconciling differences in predictions of temperature response of soil organic matter (2002) Soil Biol.
