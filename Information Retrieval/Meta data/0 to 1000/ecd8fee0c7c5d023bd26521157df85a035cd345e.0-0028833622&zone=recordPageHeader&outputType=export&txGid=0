Strong net cooling is ascribed to additions of bromocarbon gases, while methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride are more nearly climate-neutral, and the CFCs and HCFCs display strong net warming. Continuing production of HFCs as substitutes for CFCs could result in sharply increasing halocarbon radiative heating in the latter part of the 21st century because of the increasing atmospheric burden of these compounds. -from Authors",,"global warming potential; halocarbon; HFC; ozone destruction; radiative forcing; warming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028833622
