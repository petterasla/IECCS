Maintained small increases in dynamic pressure in the order of a nanoPascal from the solar wind due to the expansion of the solar magnetic corona may be sufficient to produce the energy that has resulted in the increase of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars. A 1 nPa increase in dynamic pressure is equivalent to the increase of about 16 nT in aa (average antipodal index) values observed over the last 100 years. The results support the hypothesis of El-Borie and Al-Thoyaib that geomagnetic activity can partially predict global mean temperatures. © 2009 Academic Journals.","Aa values; Geomagnetic induction; Global warming; Solar corona expansion; Solar wind",,,,,,,"El-Borie, M.A., Al-Thoyaib, S.S., Can we use the aa geomagnetic activity index to predict partially the variability in global mean temperatures?
