The results of existing forecasts of the alteration of the global air temperature, radiation, and precipitation were also used. In the case that the carbon dioxide content is doubled in the atmosphere by the end of the 21st century, a medium and weak decrease in the soil fertility will be observed in the central (cereal) regions of Mexico; furthermore, a significant (over 20%) decrease in fertility will be observed in the tropical regions, where sugar cane is cultivated. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2006.",,"Saccharum",,,,,,"Aidarov, I.P., (1985) Regulation of the Water-Salt and Nutrition Regimes of Irrigated Soils, , (Agropromizdat, Moscow) [in Russian]; Budyko, M.I., (1977) Global Ecology, , (Mysl', Moscow) [in Russian]; Volobuev, V.R., (1974) Introduction to the Energy of Soil Formation, , (Nauka, Moscow) [in Russian]; Dobrovol'skii, G.V., Kust, G.S., ""The Main Methods of Predicting the Evolution of Soils under the Effect of Global Climate Changes"" (1994) Vestn.
