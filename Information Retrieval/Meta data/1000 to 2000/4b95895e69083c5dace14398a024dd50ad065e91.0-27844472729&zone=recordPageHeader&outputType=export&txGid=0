The results provide a quantitative description of the chemistries and of the acid-base reactions involved and predict problems due to the formation of fouling and corrosive ionic liquids. A detailed knowledge of the acid-base chemistries involved in the formation of such ionic liquids allows one to solve such problems by the use of additives and helps to improve the efficiency of power production from biomass combustion effluents. Such efficiencies would make biomass more competitive with fossil fuels and allow one to minimize the probable influence of CO2 buildup on global warming.","Acid-base chemistry; Combustion of biomass; Computer calculations; Fouling liquids; Thermodynamic calculations",,,,,,,"Blander, M., Ragland, K.W., Cole, R.L., Libera, J., Pelton, A.D., The inorganic chemistry of wood combustion for power production (1995) Biomass and Bioenergy, 8, pp. 29-38; Blander, M., Pelton, A.D., The inorganic chemistry of the combustion of wheat straw (1997) Biomass and Bioenergy, 12, pp. 295-298; Miles, T.R., Miles Jr., T.R., Baxter, L.L., Bryers, R.W., Jenkins, B.M., Oden, L.L., (1996) Alkali Deposits Found in Biomass Power Plants: A Preliminary Investigation of Their Extent and Nature, , Summary Report NREL/TP-433-8142, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA; Pelton, A.D., Blander, M., Thermodynamic analysis of ordered liquid solutions by a modified quasichemical approach-application to silicate slags (1986) Metall.
