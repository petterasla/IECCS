Evidence of endangered species' population declines and shifts in vegetation communities are already underway in the Florida Keys. SLR predictions indicate large areas of these habitats may be eliminated in the next century. Using the Florida Keys as a model system, we present a process for evaluating conservation options for rare and endemic taxa. Considering species characteristics and habitat, we assess central issues that influence conservation options. We contrast traditional and controversial options for two animal and two plant species giving special emphasis to perceptions of ecological risk and safety from SLR and suggest courses of action. Multiple strategies will be required to spread extinction risk and will be effective for different time periods. Global climate change presents an uncertain, perhaps no-analog future that will challenge land managers and practitioners to re-evaluate equilibrium-state-conceived laws and policies not only for these taxa, but for many facing similar threats. To embrace conservation in a changing world will require a new dialogue that includes controversial ideas, a review of existing laws and policies, and preparation for the oncoming change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Courses of actions; Ecological risks; Endangered species; Extinction risks; Florida keys; Global climate changes; Land managers; Model system; Multiple strategy; Plant species; Population decline; Sea level rise; Storm intensity; Time-periods; Vegetation community; Conservation; Ecosystems; Risk perception; Sea level; Climate change; climate change; endangered species; extinction risk; habitat conservation; policy implementation; sea level change; uncertainty analysis; vegetation structure; Florida [United States]; Florida Keys; United States; Animalia",,,,,,"Armstrong, D.P., Seddon, P.J., Directions in reintroduction biology (2008) Trends Ecol E, 23, pp. 20-25; Ashley, M.V., Willson, M.F., Pergams, O.R.W., Evolutionarily enlightened management (2003) Biol Conserv, 111, pp. 115-123; Baguette, M., The classical metapopulation theory and the real, natural world: a critical appraisal (2004) Basic Appl Ecol, 5, pp. 213-224; Barrett-Lennard, E.G., The interaction between waterlogging and salinity in higher plants: causes, consequences and implications (2003) Plant Soil, 253, pp. 35-54; Bender, M.A., Knutson, T.R., Tuleya, R.E., Modeled impact of anthropogenic warming on the frequency of intense atlantic hurricanes (2010) Science, 327, pp. 454-458; Bouzat, J.L., Conservation genetics of population bottlenecks: the role of chance, selection, and history (2010) Cons Gen, 11, pp. 463-478; Bradley, K., Saha, S., (2009) Post-hurricane responses of rare plant species and vegetation of pine rocklands in the lower Florida Keys, , Report submitted to USFWS National Key Deer Refuge, Florida; Chapron, G., Samelius, G., Where species go, legal protections must follow (2008) Science, 322, p. 1049; Craig, R.K., Stationarity is dead-long live transformation: five principles for climate change adaptation law (2010) Harvard Environ Law Rev, 34, pp. 9-73; Crouse, A.L., (2005) Genetic analysis of the endangered silver rice rat (Oryzomys palustris natator) and Lower Keys marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris hefneri), , M.
