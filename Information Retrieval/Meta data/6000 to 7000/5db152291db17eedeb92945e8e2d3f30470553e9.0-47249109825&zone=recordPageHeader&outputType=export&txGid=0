Jordan and most Middle East countries use fossil fuels exclusively. Therefore, new technologies which could accommodate the demand for cleaner effluents, such as: combined cycles, fluidized bed combustion, magneto hydrodynamics, fuel cells, nuclear power, natural gas, renewable energy, and energy conservation have been considered. CO2 being the most produced gas, many technical methods of reducing and reusing CO2 have been suggested such as: Injection in oceans, storage in caverns, injection in depleted oil and gas fields, pumping during oil recovery, storage as CO2 ice, elimination by fixation using water algae, and increasing plantation especially forestation. These methods are being used at different degrees in the Middle East countries. Reduction of formation and harmful effects of other gaseous pollutants is also discussed, with some concentration on the transportation sector, energy efficiency and fuel cells, which have special importance for the developing countries. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Appropriate technologies; CO2 abatement; Energy efficiency; Environment; Reducing gaseous pollutants; Saving fuel in transportation","Air cleaners; Alternative fuels; Climate change; Combustion; Conservation; Direct energy conversion; Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy resources; Fluid dynamics; Fluid mechanics; Fluidization; Fluidized beds; Fog; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuels; Gas industry; Global warming; Pollution; Renewable energy resources; Smoke; Technology; Thermochemistry; Appropriate technologies; Combined cycling; Fossil fuel combustion; Gaseous pollutants; Harmful effects; Magneto-hydro-dynamics (MHD); Middle east; New technologies; Renewable energy (RE); Fluidized bed combustion; algae",,,,,,"(1990) World Warming, , Anonymous International Power Generation.
