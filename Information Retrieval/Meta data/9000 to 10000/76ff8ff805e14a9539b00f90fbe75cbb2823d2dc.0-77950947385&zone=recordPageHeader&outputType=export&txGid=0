A dynamic LCA approach is proposed to improve the accuracy of LCA by addressing the inconsistency of temporal assessment. This approach consists of first computing a dynamic life cycle inventory (LCI), considering the temporal profile of emissions. Then, time-dependent characterization factors are calculated to assess the dynamic LCI in real-time impact scores for any given time horizon. Although generally applicable to any impact category, this approach is developed here for global warming, based on the radiative forcing concept. This case study demonstrates that the use of global warming potentials for a given time horizon to characterize greenhouse gas emissions leads to an inconsistency between the time frame chosen for the analysis and the time period covered by the LCA results. Dynamic LCA is applied to the US EPA LCA on renewable fuels, which compares the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of different biofuels with fossil fuels including land-use change emissions. The comparison of the results obtained with both traditional and dynamic LCA approaches shows that the difference can be important enough to change the conclusions on whether or not a biofuel meets some given global warming reduction targets. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Dynamic LCA; Global warming impact; Global warming potential; Land-use change; Life cycle inventories; Life-cycle assessments; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Radiative forcings; Reduction targets; Renewable fuels; Temporal assessment; Temporal information; Temporal profile; Time frame; Time horizons; Time periods; Time-dependent; Air pollution control; Biofuels; Environmental Protection Agency; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; biofuel; fossil fuel; accuracy assessment; biofuel; emission control; environmental impact assessment; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; land use change; life cycle analysis; real time; article; case study; controlled study; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; land use; life cycle assessment; radiative forcing; renewable energy; time; United States; Animals; Global Warming; Life Cycle Stages",,,,,,"ISO 14040:2006: Environmental management - Life cycle assessment - Principles and frameworkHauschild, M.Z., Assessing environmental impacts in a life-cycle perspective (2005) Environ.
