Globally, traffic-related emissions of carbon dioxide are growing rapidly. This paper presents a new method based on a multiple linear regression model to disaggregate traffic-related CO 2 emission estimates from the parish-level scale to a 1×1km grid scale. Considering the allocation factors (population density, urban area, income, road density) together, we used a correlation and regression analysis to determine the relationship between these factors and traffic-related CO 2 emissions, and developed the best-fit model. The method was applied to downscale the traffic-related CO 2 emission values by parish (i.e. county) for the State of Louisiana into 1-km 2 grid cells. In the four highest parishes in traffic-related CO 2 emissions, the biggest area that has above average CO 2 emissions is found in East Baton Rouge, and the smallest area with no CO 2 emissions is also in East Baton Rouge, but Orleans has the most CO 2 emissions per unit area. The result reveals that high CO 2 emissions are concentrated in dense road network of urban areas with high population density and low CO 2 emissions are distributed in rural areas with low population density, sparse road network. The proposed method can be used to identify the emission "" hot spots"" at fine scale and is considered more accurate and less time-consuming than the previous methods. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Multiple linear regression model; Spatial disaggregation","Best-fit models; Carbon dioxide emissions; Decision makers; Emission values; Grid cells; Grid scale; High population density; Hot spot; Louisiana; Multiple linear regression models; Per unit; Population densities; Road density; Road network; Road traffic; Spatial disaggregation; Spatial scale; Traffic-related; Urban areas; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Motor transportation; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Rural areas; Linear regression; carbon dioxide; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decision making; emission inventory; global warming; pollution monitoring; population density; regression analysis; road transport; rural area; spatial analysis; article; exhaust gas; multiple linear regression analysis; population density; priority journal; traffic; urban area; Louisiana; United States",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Baldasano, J.M., Guereca, L.P., Lopez, E., Gasso, S., Jimenez-Guerrero, P., Development of a high-resolution (1 km×1 km, 1 h) emission model for Spain: the high-elective resolution modelling emission system (HERMES) (2008) Atmospheric Environment, 42 (31), pp. 7215-7233; Bhaduri, B., Bright, E., Coleman, P., Urban, M., LandScan USA: a high resolution geospatial and temporal modeling approach for population distribution and dynamics (2007) GeoJournal, 69, pp. 103-117; Briggs, D., (2005) APMoSPHERE (Air Pollution Modelling for Support to Policy on Health, Environment and Risk Management in Europe), , Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London; (2009), European Environment Agency, EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook-2009.
