Such reanalyses rely on satellite data, but until now, no comprehensive global satellite data set has been available for studying tropical cyclones. Here a new hurricane satellite (HURSAT) data record is introduced that will facilitate the reanalysis of TCs by providing satellite imagery in a standard format for the period of record 1983 to 2005. The data are collected from Japanese, European and U.S. geostationary satellites and the infrared window channel data, which are particularly relevant for TC analyses, have been recalibrated to reduce inter-satellite differences. Observations are provided on a 0.07°×0.07° (∼8km) Lagrangian grid that follows the TC center at 3-hourly intervals. The data set will be updated annually and work is also underway to expand the data set backward to the late 1970s. © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","Geostationary; Hurricanes; Satellite; Tropical cyclones","Data records; Data sets; European; Geostationary; Hurricanes; Infrared windows; Lagrangian; Long-term trends; Re-analysis; Satellite; Satellite data; Satellite observations; Standard format; Tropical cyclone; Tropical cyclones; Infrared window channels; Satellite datum; Satellite differences; Standard formats; Global warming; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Standards; Storms; Tropics; Hurricanes; Geostationary satellites",,,,,,"Chu, J.-H., Sampson, C.R., Levine, A.S., Fukada, E., (1945) The Joint Typhoon Warning Center tropical cyclone best-tracks, p. 22. , Pearl Harbor, Hawaii: Joint Typhoon Warning Center, 2002; Neumann, C.J., Jarvinen, B.R., McAdie, C.J., Hammer, G.R., (1999) Tropical Cyclones of the North Atlantic Ocean, 1871-1998, p. 206. , Silver Springs, MD: NOAA; Landsea, C.W., Anderson, C., Charles, N., Clark, G., Dunion, J., Femandez-Partagas, J., Hungerford, P., Zimmer, M., The Atlantic hurricane database reanalysis project: Documentation for the 1851-1910 alterations and additions to the HURDAT database (2004) Hurricanes and Typhoons: Past, Present and Future, pp. 177-221. , R.
