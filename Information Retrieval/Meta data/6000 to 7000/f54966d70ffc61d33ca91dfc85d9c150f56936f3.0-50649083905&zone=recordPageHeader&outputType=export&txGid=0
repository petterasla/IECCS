Existing atmospheric monitors based on non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors have known problems - they are non-linear, sensitive to water vapor concentration, and susceptible to drift. Many cannot easily be simultaneously calibrated across different sites to the level of accuracy required for use in atmospheric studies. We present results from field trials by Pennsylvania State University and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of a newly available analyzer, based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), capable of measuring the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H 2O). In addition, we present data from a new analyzer which measures CO2, methane (CH4), and H2O. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Atmospherics; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Concentration (process); Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Light measurement; Methane; Vapors; Atmospheric levels; Cavity-ring down; Cavity-Ring-Down-Spectroscopy; Climate modelling; Field trials; Global climate changes; National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration; Non-dispersive infrared; Non-linear; Pennsylvania state university; Water vapor concentration; Water vapor",,,,,,"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , http://www.ipcc.ch, Cambridge University Press; Conway, T., Tans, P., Waterman, L., Thoning, K., Kitzis, D., Masarie, K., Zhang, N., (1994) J.
