Here, we present results from a 2-year field experiment in a Carex fen ecosystem on the southernmost tip of South America, where we examined the effects of solar ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-315nm) and warming on above- and belowground plant production, C:N ratios, decomposition rates and earthworm population sizes. Solar UVB radiation was manipulated using transparent plastic filter films to create a near-ambient (90% of ambient UVB) or a reduced solar UVB treatment (15% of ambient UVB). The warming treatment was imposed passively by wrapping the same filter material around the plots resulting in a mean air and soil temperature increase of about 1.2°C. Aboveground plant production was not affected by warming, and marginally reduced at near-ambient UVB only in the second season. Aboveground plant biomass also tended to have a lower C:N ratio under near-ambient UVB and was differently affected at the two temperatures (marginal UVB × temperature interaction). Leaf decomposition of one dominant sedge species (Carex curta) tended to be faster at near-ambient UVB than at reduced UVB. Leaf decomposition of a codominant species (Carex decidua) was significantly faster at near-ambient UVB; root decomposition of this species tended to be lower at increased temperature and interacted with UVB. We found, for the first time in a field experiment that epigeic earthworm density and biomass was 36% decreased by warming but remained unaffected by UVB radiation. Our results show that present-day solar UVB radiation and modest warming can adversely affect ecosystem functioning and engineers of this fen. However, results on plant biomass production also showed that treatment manipulations of co-occurring global change factors can be overridden by the local climatic situation in a given study year. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biomass production; Carex curta; Carex decidua; Decomposition; Dendrobaena octaedra; Earthworms; Ecosystem functioning; Global change; Global warming; Ozone depletion; Soil heterotrophs","aboveground production; ambient air; belowground production; biomass; climate change; climate effect; decomposition; earthworm; ecosystem function; ecosystem response; experimental study; fen; field survey; global perspective; sedge; solar radiation; ultraviolet B radiation; warming; Argentina; South America; Tierra del Fuego [(PRV) Argentina]; Carex; Carex canescens canescens; Carex decidua; Dendrobaena octaedra",,,,,,"Aerts, R., The freezer defrosting: Global warming and litter decomposition rates in cold biomes (2006) Journal of Ecology, 94, pp. 713-724; Aphalo, P., Do current levels of UV-B radiation affect vegetation?
