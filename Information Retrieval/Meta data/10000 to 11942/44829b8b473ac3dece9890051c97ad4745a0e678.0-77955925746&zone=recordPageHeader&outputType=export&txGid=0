Significant differences in pGPP, RESP, and pMET were found between low- and high-flow conditions, with lowest rates of all processes occurring during high-flow conditions. CO2 fluxes were influenced by metabolic processes at all but one site, with the bay's surface waters being autotrophic and a sink for atmospheric CO2 during low-flow conditions and less autotrophic and a source of atmospheric CO2 during high-flow conditions. Significant differences in pMET were found between the two river plumes during low-flow conditions at spatial scales of 1.5 km; however, no differences between river plumes were found during high-flow conditions. Our study suggests that an increase in storms associated with global climate change could impact surface water metabolic dynamics of tropical estuaries. © 2010 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","CO2 flux; Estuaries; Metabolism; Primary production; Respiration; Storms","autotrophy; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; marine ecosystem; metabolism; net primary production; river plume; surface water; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Hilo Bay; United States",,,,,,"Alpine, A.E., Cloern, J.E., Trophic interactions and direct physical effects control phytoplankton biomass and production in an estuary (1992) Limnology and Oceanography, 37 (5), pp. 946-955; Anderson, T.H., Taylor, G.T., Nutrient pulses, plankton blooms, and seasonal hypoxia in western Long Island Sound (2001) Estuaries, 24 (2), pp. 228-243; Andersson, A.J., Mackenzie, F.T., Shallow-water oceans: A source or sink of atmospheric CO2?
