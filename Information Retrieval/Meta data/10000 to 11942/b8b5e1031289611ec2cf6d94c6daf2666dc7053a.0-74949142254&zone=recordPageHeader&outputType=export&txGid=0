The resulting changes to plant function and interaction with herbivores are likely to have significant ecological, forestry, and agricultural consequences. We used a glasshouse manipulative study to test the effects of wind exposure on a range of morphological, functional, and chemical characteristics of seedlings of Eucalyptus tereticornis, a widespread coastal tree. Chronic wind exposure (6 wk of 3 h d-1) resulted in reduced height growth and leaf area, thicker leaf cuticle, slightly higher leaf dry matter, and greater phenolic concentration. Chronic and acute (single 3-h pulse) exposure to wind induced greater variability in minimum epidermal water conductance. The changes that occurred to seedlings show the significance of wind as an active abiotic agent in shaping plants. The changes, particularly if they are maintained or enhanced over time, may alter rates of herbivory and have the potential to lead to cascading ecological consequences that are especially relevant as climate changes. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Abiotic factors; Climate change; Cuticle; Growth; Herbivory; Phenolics","agricultural change; climate effect; coastal zone; cuticle; dry matter; ecological approach; evergreen tree; functional change; global warming; growth response; height; leaf area; morphology; phenolic compound; phenology; phytochemistry; plant-herbivore interaction; seedling; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus tereticornis",,,,,,"Arens, N.C., Climate and atmosphere interact to drive vegetation change (2001) Trends Ecol Evol, 16, p. 18; Ashton, P.M.S., Berlyn, G.P., Leaf adaptations of some Shorea species to sun and shade (1992) New Phytol, 121, pp. 587-596; Boland, D.J., Brooker, M.I.H., Chippendale, G.M., Hall, N., Hyland, B.P.M., Johnston, R.D., Kleinig, D.A., Turner, J.D., (2006) Forest Trees of Australia, , CSIRO, Melbourne; Brooker, M.I.H., Kleinig, D.A., (1999) Field Guide to Eucalypts, 1, p. 353. , South-eastern Australia.
