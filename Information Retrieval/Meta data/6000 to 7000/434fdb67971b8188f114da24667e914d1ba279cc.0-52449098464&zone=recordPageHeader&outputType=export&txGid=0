However, knowledge of gas flux from irrigated agriculture is very limited. From April 2005 to October 2006, a study was conducted in the Aral Sea Basin, Uzbekistan, to quantify and compare emissions of N 2O and CH 4 in various annual and perennial land-use systems: irrigated cotton, winter wheat and rice crops, a poplar plantation and a natural Tugai (floodplain) forest. In the annual systems, average N 2O emissions ranged from 10 to 150 μg N 2O-Nm -2 h -1 with highest N 2O emissions in the cotton fields, covering a similar range of previous studies from irrigated cropping systems. Emission factors (uncorrected for background emission), used to determine the fertilizer-induced N 2O emission as a percentage of N fertilizer applied, ranged from 0.2% to 2.6%. Seasonal variations in N 2O emissions were principally controlled by fertilization and irrigation management. Pulses of N 2O emissions occurred after concomitant N-fertilizer application and irrigation. The unfertilized poplar plantation showed high N 2O emissions over the entire study period (30 μg N 2O-Nm -2h -1), whereas only negligible fluxes of N 2O (&lt;2 μg N 2O-Nm -2 h -1) occurred in the Tugai. Significant CH 4 fluxes only were determined from the flooded rice field: Fluxes were low with mean flux rates of 32 mg CH 4m -2 day -1 and a low seasonal total of 35.2 kg CH 4 ha -1. The global warming potential (GWP) of the N 2O and CH 4 fluxes was highest under rice and cotton, with seasonal changes between 500 and 3000 kg CO 2 eq.ha -1. The biennial cotton-wheat-rice crop rotation commonly practiced in the region would average a GWP of 2500 kg CO 2 eq.ha -1 yr -1. The analyses point out opportunities for reducing the GWP of these irrigated agricultural systems by (i) optimization of fertilization and irrigation practices and (ii) conversion of annual cropping systems into perennial forest plantations, especially on less profitable, marginal lands. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Arid climate; Central Asia; Climate change; Cotton; Dryland agriculture; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Land use change; Rice; Tugai forest; Uzbekistan; Winter wheat","agricultural practice; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; cotton; crop rotation; dryland farming; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; irrigation; land use; methane; nitrous oxide; Aral Sea; Asia; Eurasia; West Asia; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Abao, E.B., Bronson, K.F., Wassmann, R., Singh, U., Simultaneous records of methane and nitrous oxide emissions in rice-based cropping systems under rainfed conditions (2000) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 58, pp. 131-139; Andren, O., Steene, E., Rajkai, K., Modelling the effects of moisture on barley straw and root decomposition in the field (1992) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 24, pp. 727-736; Aulakh, M.S., Khera, T.S., Doran, J.W., Bronson, K.F., Denitrification, N 2O and CO 2 fluxes in rice-wheat cropping system as affected by crop residues, fertilizer N and legume green manure (2001) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 34, pp. 375-389; Conrad, R., Soil microorganisms as controllers of atmospheric trace gases (H 2, CO, CH 4, OCS, N 2O, and NO) (1996) Microbiological Reviews, 60, p. 609; Davidson, E.A., Sources of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide followed wetting of dry soils (1992) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 56, pp. 92-102; Dobbie, K.E., McTaggart, I.P., Smith, K.A., Nitrous oxide emissions from intensive agricultural systems: Variations between crops and seasons, key driving variables, and mean emission factors (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres, 20 (104), pp. 26891-26899; (1998) World Reference Base for Soil Resources, , FAO ISSS-ISRIC-FAO, FAO, Rome, Italy; (2000) Crops and Drops.
