It is critical to study the contribution of heat transferred by building fabrics to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect because of the increasing threat of global warming. One method to investigate this is to measure the SH loss of building fabrics. Its magnitude is the product of object's mass, m, its specific heat, c, and its temperature change, ΔT. In this study, CSTM estimates the cooling curves of four building finishes tiles: concrete, marble, clay, and ceramic. The results are quite satisfactory in that there is only 11.86% error between the SH calculated by the formal Sensible eat equation (mcΔT) and the CSTM technique. The study also shows that clay tiles have the highest SH loss per unit volume to the surrounding environment, and the optimal parameter settings for the technique are discussed.","Continuous temperature measurement; Infrared technology; Sensible heat; Urban heat island effect",,,,,,,"ASHRAE Handbook (2005) ASHRAE Handbook: Fundamentals, , American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Atlanta, Ga; Bahadori, M.N., Haghighat, F., Weekly storage of coolness in heavy brick and adobe walls (1985) Energy and Buildings, 8, pp. 259-270; Berdahl, P., Bretz, S.E., Preliminary survey of the solar reflectance of cool roofing materials (1997) Energy and Buildings, 25, pp. 149-158; Bonacquisti, V., Casale, G., Palmieri, S., Siani, A., A canopy layer model and its application to Rome (2006) Science of the Total Environment, 364, pp. 1-13; Bretz, S.E., Akbari, H., Long-term performance of high-albedo roof coatings (1997) Energy and Buildings, 25, pp. 159-167; Bruse, M., Fleer, H., Simulating surface-plant-air interactions inside urban environments with a threedimensional numerical model (1998) Environmental Modelling and Software, 13, pp. 373-384; Chudnovsky, A., Ben-Dor, E., Saaroh, H., Diurnal thermal behaviour of selected urban objects using remote sensing measurements (2004) Energy and Buildings, 36, pp. 1063-1074; Ciutina, A., Tuca, I., Ungureanu, V., Dubina, D., Design of buildings including environmental impact (2010) Environmental Engineering and Management Journal, 9, pp. 1121-1131; Giridharan, R., Ganesan, S., Lau, S., Daytime urban heat island effect in high-rise and high-density residential developments in Hong Kong (2004) Energy and Buildings, 36, pp. 525-534; Hafner, J., Kidder, S., Urban heat island modeling in conjunction with satellite-derived surface/soil parameters (1999) Journal of Applied Meteorology, 38, pp. 448-465; Hartz, D., Prashad, L., Hedquist, B., Golden, J., Brazel, A., Linking satellite images and hand-held infrared thermography to observed neighborhood climate conditions (2006) Remote Sensing of Environment, 104, pp. 190-200; Holt, T., Pullen, J., Urban canopy modeling of the New York city metropolitan area: A comparison and validation of single and multilayer parameterizations (2006) Monthly Weather Review, 135, pp. 1906-1930; Hoyano, A., Kohichi, A., Takehisa, K., Analysis of the sensible heat flux from the exterior surface of buildings using time sequential thermography (1999) Atmospheric Environmen, 33, pp. 3491-3951; Hung, T., Daisuke, U., Shiro, O., Yoshifumi, Y., Assessment with satellite data of the urban heat island effects in Asian mega cities (2006) International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 8, pp. 34-48; Iino, A., Hoyano, A., Development of a method to predict the heat island potential using remote sensing and GIS data (1996) Energy and Buildings, 23, pp. 199-205; Johnson, G., Oke, T.R., Lyons, T.J., Steyn, D.G., Watson, I.D., Voogt, J.A., Simulation of surface urban heat islands under ""ideal"" conditions at night Part 1: Theory and Tests Against Field Data (1991) Boundary Layer Meteorology, 56, pp. 275-294; Magee, N., Curtis, J., Wendler, G., The urban heat island effect at Fairbanks, Alaska (1999) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 64, pp. 39-47; Maldague, X.P., (2001) Theory and Practice of Infrared Technology for Nondestructive Testing, , John Wiley and Sons, Canada; Memon, R.A., Leung, D.Y., Liu, C.H., An investigation of urban heat island intensity (UHII) as an indicator of urban heating (2009) Atmospheric Research, 94, pp. 491-500; Niachou, K., Livada, I., Santamouris, M., Experimental study of temperature and airflow distribution inside an urban street canyon during hot summer weather conditions.
