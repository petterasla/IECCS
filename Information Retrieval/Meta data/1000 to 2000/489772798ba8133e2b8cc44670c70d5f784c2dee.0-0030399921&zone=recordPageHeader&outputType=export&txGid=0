This paper presents the preliminary results of environmental life cycle analyses of fuel cell vehicle drives and other low pollution options, thus enabling a comparative assessment to be made.","Emissions; Fuel cells; Fuel consumption, global warming; Hydrogen; Life cycle analysis; Transport systems","Air pollution control; Environmental impact; Exhaust gases; Fuel consumption; Global warming; Hydrogen; Motor transportation; Life cycle analysis; Low emission transportation systems; Fuel cells",,,,,,"Patil, P., The new generation of vehicles - Market opportunities for fuel cells (1995) Fourth Grove Fuel Cell Symposium, , London, 19-22 Sept; Adams, V.W., Environmental life cycle analyses of transport systems (1996) 2nd International Fuel Cell Conference, , 5-8 Feb., Kobe, Japan; Cummins Engine Co.
