The publicly available specification PAS 2050 combines approaches to a variety of greenhouse gas specific assessment issues to deliver a globally applicable product Carbon Footprinting (CF) method, which is expected to be widely accepted. Specifically, this paper aims to demonstrate the implementation of a CF scheme for a common canned mussel product according to PAS 2050 guidelines. A final value of 4.35kg CO2e per triple pack of round cans of mussels was calculated. Furthermore, this CF study led to identify primary packaging (can production) and mussel shell management as the main activities where efforts should focus for climate change mitigation. Throughout this case study, CF opportunities and drawbacks are discussed. The whole text tries to provide a starting point for both mussel processors and policy makers to benefit from the potential advantages of a responsible use of this increasingly popular tool. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Canned mussels; Carbon footprint; Global warming; Life Cycle Assessment; PAS 2050","article; canned food; climate change; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; mussel; priority journal",,,,,,"(2007) ADEME Bilan Carbone™-Quantify Emissions, Anticipate Action, , http://www.ademe.fr/bilan-carbone, French Environment and Energy Management Agency, France; Althaus, H.J., Chudacoff, M., Hischier, R., Jungbluth, N., Osses, M., Primas, A., (2007), Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals. ecoinvent report No. 8, v2.0.
