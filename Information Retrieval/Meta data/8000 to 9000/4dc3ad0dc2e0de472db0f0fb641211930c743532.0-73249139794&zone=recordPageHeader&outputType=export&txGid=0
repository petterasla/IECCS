Excess wintertime mortality related to pneumonia has been noted for over a century, but the seasonality of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been described relatively recently and is poorly understood. Improved understanding of environmental influence on disease seasonality has taken on new urgency due to global climate change. Methods: We evaluated 602 cases of IPD reported in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, from 2002 to 2007. Poisson regression models incorporating seasonal smoothers were used to identify associations between weekly weather patterns and case counts. Associations between acute (day-to-day) environmental fluctuations and IPD occurrence were evaluated using a case-crossover approach. Effect modification across age and sex strata was explored, and meta-regression models were created using stratum-specific estimates for effect. Results: IPD incidence was greatest in the wintertime, and spectral decomposition revealed a peak at 51.0 weeks, consistent with annual periodicity. After adjustment for seasonality, yearly increases in reporting, and temperature, weekly incidence was found to be associated with clear-sky UV index (IRR per unit increase in index: 0.70 [95% CI 0.54-0.91]). The effect of UV index was highest among young strata and decreased with age. At shorter time scales, only an association with increases in ambient sulphur oxides was linked to disease risk (OR for highest tertile of exposure 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93). Conclusion: We confirmed the wintertime predominance of IPD in a major urban center. The major predictor of IPD in Philadelphia is extended periods of low UV radiation, which may explain observed wintertime seasonality. The mechanism of action of diminished light exposure on disease occurrence may be due to direct effects on pathogen survival or host immune function via altered 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin-D metabolism. These findings may suggest less diminution in future IPD risk with climate change than would be expected if wintertime seasonality was driven by temperature. © 2009 White et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"calcitriol; sulfur oxide; adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; bacteremia; bacterial survival; child; climate change; community acquired pneumonia; controlled study; disease association; environmental factor; environmental temperature; female; host resistance; human; incidence; infant; infection risk; light exposure; major clinical study; male; mortality; pathogenesis; periodicity; pneumococcal infection; preschool child; risk assessment; school child; seasonal variation; sex difference; Streptococcus pneumoniae; ultraviolet radiation; United States; urban area; vitamin D metabolism; winter; air pollution; middle aged; pneumococcal infection; regression analysis; risk factor; season; sunlight; temperature; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollution; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Philadelphia; Pneumococcal Infections; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Seasons; Sunlight; Temperature; Ultraviolet Rays; Young Adult",,"calcitriol, 32222-06-3, 32511-63-0, 66772-14-3; sulfur oxide, 12624-32-7",,,,"Dowell, S.F., Ho, M.S., Seasonality of infectious diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome-what we don't know can hurt us (2004) The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 4, pp. 704-708. , 10.1016/S1473-3099(04)01177-6, 15522683; Singer, C., A Short History of Medicine (1928) Ancient Greece, pp. 1-26. , New York: Oxford University Press, 1; Kim, P.E., Musher, D.M., Glezen, W.P., Rodriguez-Barradas, M.C., Nahm, W.K., Wright, C.E., Association of invasive pneumococcal disease with season, atmospheric conditions, air pollution, and the isolation of respiratory viruses (1996) Clin Infect Dis, 22, pp. 100-106; Talbot, T.R., Poehling, K.A., Hartert, T.V., Arbogast, P.G., Halasa, N.B., Edwards, K.M., Schaffner, W., Griffin, M.R., Seasonality of invasive pneumococcal disease: temporal relation to documented influenza and respiratory syncytial viral circulation (2005) American Journal of Medicine, 118, pp. 285-291. , 10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.09.016, 15745727; Dowell, S.F., Whitney, C.G., Wright, C., Rose, C.E., Schuchat, A., Seasonal patterns of invasive pneumococcal disease (2003) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 9, pp. 573-579; Fisman, D.N., Lim, S., Wellenius, G.A., Johnson, C., Britz, P., Gaskins, M., Maher, J., Haas, C.N., It's not the heat, it's the humidity: wet weather increases legionellosis risk in the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area (2005) Journal of Infectious Diseases, 192, pp. 2066-2073. , 10.1086/498248, 16288369; Jensen, E.S., Lundbye-Christensen, S., Pedersen, L., Sorensen, H.T., Schonheyder, H.C., Seasonal variation in meningococcal disease in Denmark: relation to age and meningococcal phenotype (2003) Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases, 35, pp. 226-229. , 10.1080/00365540310010921, 12839148; Austrian, R., The pneumococcus at the millennium: not down, not out (1999) Journal of Infectious Diseases, 179 (SUPPL. 2), pp. S338-41. , 10.1086/513841, 10081505; Robinson, K.A., Baughman, W., Rothrock, G., Barrett, N.L., Pass, M., Lexau, C., Damaske, B., Patterson, J., Epidemiology of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in the United States, 1995-1998: Opportunities for prevention in the conjugate vaccine era (2001) JAMA, 285, pp. 1729-1735. , 10.1001/jama.285.13.1729, 11277827; Ortqvist, A., Hedlund, J., Kalin, M., Streptococcus pneumoniae: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical features (2005) Seminars in Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine, 26, pp. 563-574; Daneman, N., McGeer, A., Green, K., Low, D.E., Macrolide resistance in bacteremic pneumococcal disease: implications for patient management (2006) Clin Infect Dis, 43, pp. 432-438. , 10.1086/505871, 16838231; Whitney, C.G., Farley, M.M., Hadler, J., Harrison, L.H., Bennett, N.M., Lynfield, R., Reingold, A., Jackson, D., Decline in invasive pneumococcal disease after the introduction of protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1737-1746. , 10.1056/NEJMoa022823, 12724479; Emergence of antimicrobial-resistant serotype 19A Streptococcus pneumoniae--Massachusetts, 2001-2006 (2007) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 56, pp. 1077-1080; Pichichero, M.E., Casey, J.R., Emergence of a multiresistant serotype 19A pneumococcal strain not included in the 7-valent conjugate vaccine as an otopathogen in children (2007) Jama, 298, pp. 1772-1778. , 10.1001/jama.298.15.1772, 17940232; Fisman, D.N., Seasonality of infectious diseases (2007) Annu Rev Public Health, 28, pp. 127-143. , 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144128, 17222079; Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
