Analysis of 82 paleosol horizons ranging in age from 3.9 to 0.7Ma reveals two primary populations: vertic paleosols with abundant mud cracks and calcic paleosols with pronounced calcite accumulation zones. Vertic paleosols are dominant in older deposits but disappear from the stratigraphic record by 2.8Ma, after which point calcic paleosols are nearly the only paleosol type present. Pedogenic carbonate nodules from 47 horizons were analyzed for oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions. In late Pliocene time carbonate δ13C values become depleted, from an average of -5.1‰ between 3.9 and 3.5Ma to -7.3‰ (VPDB) between 2.75 and 2.25Ma, recording an increase in C3 plants at the expense of C4 grasses. This finding suggests that summer precipitation decreased in the study area from 3.8 to 2.5Ma, possibly due to a weakening of the summer monsoon. The absence of vertic paleosols in post-2.8Ma deposits supports this hypothesis. The increase in abundance of calcic paleosols through time suggests a long-term increase in aridity. A gradual enrichment of about 2‰ in δ18O values from 3.9 to 0.7Ma also likely resulted from increased aridification and evaporative enrichment of soil water. Our findings suggest that global cooling in late Pliocene time resulted in increased aridity in southern California due to decreased monsoonal activity and the end of persistent El Niño conditions in the Pacific Ocean. The observed enrichment in δ18O in the Fish Creek-Vallecito basin is opposite the change that would be produced by the onset of a rain shadow, suggesting that significant uplift of the Peninsular Ranges occurred before 3.8 Ma. © 2011.","Climate; Paleosols; Peninsular ranges; Pleistocene; Pliocene; Southern California; Stable isotopes","aridity; C3 plant; C4 plant; climate variation; El Nino; paleosol; Pleistocene; Pliocene; soil horizon; soil water; stable isotope; California; Coast Ranges; Fish Creek [California]; Pacific Ocean; Peninsular Ranges; United States; Vallecito Creek; Poaceae",,,,,,"Abbot, P.L., Smith, T.E., Sonora, Mexico, source for the Eocene Poway Conglomerate of southern California (1989) Geology, 17 (4), pp. 329-332; Adams, D.K., Comrie, A.C., The North American Monsoon (1997) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 78 (10), pp. 2197-2213; Amundson, R.G., Chadwick, O.A., Sowers, J.M., Doner, H.E., Relationship between climate and vegetation and the stable carbon isotope chemistry of soils in the eastern Mojave Desert, Nevada (1988) Quaternary Research, 29, pp. 245-254; Axelrod, D.I., History of the Mediterranean ecosystem in California (1973) Ecological Studies, Analysis and Synthesis, 7, pp. 225-277. , Springer-Verlag, F. di Castri, H.A.
