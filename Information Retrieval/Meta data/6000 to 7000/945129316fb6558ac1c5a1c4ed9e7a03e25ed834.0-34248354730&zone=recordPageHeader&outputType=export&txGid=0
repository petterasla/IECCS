There are also serious concerns of global warming from burning of fossil fuels. It may be time for India to explore options which can substitute petrol and diesel and are climate-friendly. In a series of two articles, we examine a few such technology and policy options. Part I focus on options for substituting petrol by ethanol from sugarcane: molasses, sugarcane juice and cellulose (bagasse). Part II analyses options for diesel substitution: Fischer-Tropsch liquids from coal, and bio-diesel from oil-bearing plants like jatropha.","Ethanol for petrol; India's oil security; Scoping technology","Jatropha",,,,,,"(2006) British Petroleum, Statistical Review of World Energy, , http://www.bp.com; More of everything (2006) The Economist, , 14 September, Anon; Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Annual Report 2004-05, Government of India(2002) Auto Fuel Policy, , Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India; Ottawa, , http://www.iogen.ca, IOGEN Corporation, Ontario, Canada;; http://www.bcintlcorp.com, Celunol Corporation, Dedham, MA, USA;Sao Paulo Sugarcane Agroindustry, , http://www.unica.com.br, UNICA, Union;; Anon., Brazil leading world in effort to boost use of ethanol, CNN, 10 March 2006Luhnow, D., Samor, G., Brazil fills up on ethanol (2006) Wall Street J, , 16 January; Axis Petroleum, State average ethanol rack prices, 2006, www.axxispetro.com/ace.shtml; American Coalition for Ethanol, www.ethanol.org(2006) US mulls ending ethanol import tariff, MSNBC, , www.msnbc.com/id/ 12634911; 4 May, Anon; Pimentel, D., Ethanol fuels: Energy balance, economics, and environmental impacts are negative (2003) Nat.
