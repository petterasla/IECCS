The first is concern for global pollution. Not only energy use but also energy sources will be defined in terms of atmospheric contamination. Annual carbon dioxide targets will be established. Architects will have to become more energy conscious and numerate. The second is a demand for a performance specification for a more satisfying indoor climate. Engineers will have to pay higher regard to the inhabitants and quantify occupant satisfaction. Building design will be performance based both in terms of external pollution and guaranteed internal conditions. © 1994.","critical loads; energy targets; Environment; global warming; health; illness; performance; welfare","Air quality; Architectural design; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Climate control; Environmental protection; Greenhouse effect; Health hazards; Indoor air pollution; Atmospheric contamination; Critical loads; Energy targets; Global warming; Environmental engineering",,,,,,"Awbi, (1991) Ventilation of Buildings, , E & FN Spon, London; Barbaree, (1993) Legionella: current status and emerging perpectives, , American Society for Microbiology, Washington DC; BRE, (1993) BREEAM An environmental assessment of existing office buildings, , Building Research Establishment, Garston, Watford; Brundrett, (1992) Legionella and building services, , Butterworth Heinemann Ltd, Oxford; Central Statistical Office, (1994) Social Trends 1994, , HMSO, London; Croome, (1977) Noise, buildings and people, , Pergamon Press, Oxford; Dept of Environment, An evaluation of energy related greenhouse gas emissions and measures to ameliorate them (1989) Energy Paper 58, , HMSO, London; Dept of Environment, (1991) Environmental action guide, , HMSO, London; Dept of Environment, (1994) Sustainable development.
