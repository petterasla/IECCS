In this study, factors impacting soil CH4 consumption were investigated using laboratory incubations of soils collected at the Free Air Carbon Transfer and Storage I site in the Duke Forest, NC, where plots have been exposed to ambient (370 μL L-1) or elevated (ambient+200 μL L-1) CO2 since August 1996. Over 1 year, nearly 90% of the 360 incubations showed net CH4 consumption, confirming that CH4-oxidizing (methanotrophic) bacteria were active. Soil moisture was significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher in the 25-30 cm layer of elevated CO2 soils over the length of the study, but soil moisture was equal between CO2 treatments in shallower soils. The increased soil moisture corresponded to decreased net CH4 oxidation, as elevated CO2 soils also oxidized 70% less CH4 at the 25-30 cm depth compared to ambient CO2 soils, while CH4 consumption was equal between treatments in shallower soils. Soil moisture content predicted (p&lt;0.05) CH4 consumption in upper layers of ambient CO2 soils, but this relationship was not significant in elevated CO2 soils at any depth, suggesting that environmental factors in addition to moisture were influencing net CH4 oxidation under elevated CO2. More than 6% of the activity assays showed net CH4 production, and of these, 80% contained soils from elevated CO2 plots. In addition, more than 50% of the CH4-producing flasks from elevated CO2 sites contained deeper (25-30 cm) soils. These results indicate that subsurface (25 cm+) CH4 production contributes to decreased net CH4 consumption under elevated CO 2 in otherwise aerobic soils. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","CH4; Elevated CO2; Methanogenesis; Methanotrophy","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; global warming; laboratory method; methane; methanogenesis; methanotrophy; oxidation; soil moisture; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,,,,,"Ambus, P., Robertson, G.P., Fluxes of CH4 and N2O in aspen stands grown under ambient and twice-ambient CO2 (1999) Plant Soil, 209, pp. 1-8; Andersen, B.L., Bidoglio, G., Leip, A., Rembges, D., A new method to study simultaneous methane oxidation and methane production in soils (1998) Glob Biogeochem Cycles, 12, pp. 587-594; Andrews, J.A., Harrison, K.G., Matamala, R., Schlesinger, W.H., Separation of root respiration from total soil respiration using carbon-13 labeling during Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) (1999) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 63, pp. 1429-1435; Aulakh, M.S., Doran, J.W., Walters, D.T., Power, J.F., Legume residue and soil water effects on denitrification in soils of different textures (1991) Soil Biol Biochem, 23, pp. 1161S-1167S; Born, M., Dörr, H., Levin, I., Methane consumption in aerated soils of the temperate zone (1990) Tellus, 42, pp. 2-8; Bradford, M.A., Ineson, P., Wookey, P.A., Lappin-Scott, H.M., Role of CH4 oxidation, production and transport in forest soil CH4 flux (2001) Soil Biol Biochem, 33, pp. 1625-1631; Castro, M.S., Melillo, J.M., Steudler, P., Chapman, J.W., Soil moisture as a predictor of methane uptake by temperate forest soils (1994) Can J Forest Res, 24, pp. 1805-1810; Castro, M.S., Steudler, P.A., Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., Bowden, R.D., Factors controlling atmospheric methane consumption by temperate forest soils (1995) Glob Biogeochem Cycles, 9, pp. 1-10; Castro, M.S., Gholz, H.L., Clark, K.L., Steudler, P.A., Effects of forest harvesting on soil methane fluxes in Florida slash pine plantations (2000) Can J Forest Res, 30, pp. 1534-1542; Dörr, H., Katruff, I., Levin, I., Soil texture parameterization of the methane uptake in aerated soils (1993) Chemosphere, 26, pp. 697-713; (2007) FACTS-I Data Archive, , http://face.env.duke.edu/main.cfm, Duke FACE Facility Avaliable at:; Foth, H.D., Withee, L.V., Jacobs, H.S., Thien, S.J., (1982) Laboratory Manual for Introductory Soil Science, , 6 William C.
