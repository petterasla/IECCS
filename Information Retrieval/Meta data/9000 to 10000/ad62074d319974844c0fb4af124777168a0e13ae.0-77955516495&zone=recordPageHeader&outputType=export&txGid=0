Although there are closed-loop green logistics models in the literature, most of them do not consider the uncertain environment in general terms. In this study, a generalized model is proposed where the uncertainty is expressed by fuzzy numbers. An interval programming model is proposed by the defined means and mean square imprecision index obtained from the integrated information of all the level cuts of fuzzy numbers. The resolution for interval programming is based on the decision maker (DM)'s preference. The resulting solution provides useful information on the expected solutions under a confidence level containing a degree of risk. The results suggest that the more optimistic the DM is, the better is the resulting solution. However, a higher risk of violation of the resource constraints is also present. By defining this probable risk, a solution procedure was developed with numerical illustrations. This provides a DM trade-off mechanism between logistic cost and the risk. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Fuzzy number; Green supply chain; Interval programming; Mean and mean square imprecision index; Risk analysis; Trade-off analysis","academic research; fuzzy mathematics; global warming; linearity; logistics; risk assessment; trade-off; article; cost; decision making; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; fuzzy logic; fuzzy system; mathematical model; risk assessment; statistical model; uncertainty; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fuzzy Logic; Logistic Models; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Bellman, R.E., Zadeh, L.A., Decision-making in a fuzzy environment (1970) Management Science, 17, pp. 141-164; Baumgarten, H., Butz, C., Fritsch, A., Sommer-Dittrich, T., Supply chain management and reverse logistics-integration of reverse logistics processes into supply chain management approaches (2003) International Symposium on Electronics and the Environment, pp. 79-83; Bass, B., Huang, G., Russo, J., Incorporating climate change into risk assessment using grey mathematical programming (1997) Journal of Environmental Management, 49 (1), pp. 107-123; Biehl, M., Prater, E., Realff, M.J., Assessing performance and uncertainly in developing carpet reverse logistics systems (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34 (2), pp. 443-463; Campos, L., Verdegay, J.L., Linear programming problems and ranking of fuzzy numbers (1989) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 32 (11), pp. 1-11; Carlsson, C., Fuller, R., On possibilistic mean value and variance of fuzzy numbers (2001) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 122 (2), pp. 315-326; Chiang, J., Fuzzy linear programming based on statistical confidence interval and interval-valued fuzzy set (2001) European Journal of Operational Research, 129 (1), pp. 65-86; Davila, E., Chang, N., Sustainable pattern analysis of a publicly owned material recovery facility in a first-growing urban setting under uncertainty (2005) Journal of Environmental Management, 75 (4), pp. 337-351; Dippon, J., Globally convergent stochastic optimization with optimal asymptotic distribution (1998) Journal of Applied Probability, 353 (2), pp. 395-402; Dubois, D., Prade, H., The mean value of a fuzzy number (1987) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 24 (3), pp. 279-300; Fleischmann, M., Krikke, H.R., Dekker, R., Flapper, S.D.P., A classification of logistics networks for product recovery (2000) Omega, 28 (6), pp. 653-666; Goetschel, R., Voxman, W., Elementary fuzzy calculus (1986) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 18 (1), pp. 31-43; Hsu, H.W., Wang, H.F., Modeling of green supply logistics (2009) Web-Based Green Products Life Cycle Management Systems: Reverse Supply Chain Utilization, pp. 268-282. , IGI Global Publication, USA, H.-F.
