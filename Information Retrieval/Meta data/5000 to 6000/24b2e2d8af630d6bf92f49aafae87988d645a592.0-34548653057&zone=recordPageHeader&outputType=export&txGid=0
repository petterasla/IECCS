To characterize anchorage mechanisms during tree uprooting, we developed a generic finite element model where real three-dimensional (3D) root system architectures were represented in a 3D soil. The model was used to simulate tree overturning during wind loading, and results compared with real data from two poplar species (Populus trichocarpa and P. deltoides). These trees were winched sideways until failure, and uprooting force and root architecture measured. The uprooting force was higher for P. deltoides than P. trichocarpa, probably due to its higher root volume and thicker lateral roots. Results from the model showed that soil type influences failure modes. In frictional soils, e.g., sandy soils, plastic failure of the soil occurred mainly on the windward side of the tree. In cohesive soils, e.g., clay soils, a more symmetrical slip surface was formed. Root systems were more resistant to uprooting in cohesive soil than in frictional soil. Applications of this generic model include virtual uprooting experiments, where each component of anchorage can be tested individually.","Biomechanics; Poplar; Populus; Root anchorage; Tree stability; Windthrow","biomechanics; deciduous tree; global warming; root system; soil mechanics; Populus; Populus deltoides; Populus trichocarpa",,,,,,"ACHIM, A., RUEL, J.-C., GARDINER, B., Effect of precommercial thinning on the resistance of balsam fir to windthrow (2005) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 35, pp. 1844-1853; BERGONZINI, J.C., LAROUSSINIE, O., Les écosystèmes forestiers dans les tempêtes (2000) ECOFOR, Ministère de 'Agriculture et de la Pêche, , Paris, France; BLACKWELL, P.G., RENNOLLS, K., COUTTS, M.P., A root anchorage model for shallowly rooted Sitka spruce (1990) Forestry, 63, pp. 73-92; BLOOMFIELD, J., The potential impacts of global warming on America's forests (2000) Critical findings for forest lands from the First National Assessment of the potential consequences of climate variability and change.
