Soil microfauna in 0-10 cm soil under a sheep-grazed pasture on a sand was assessed quarterly in FACE rings that were either at ambient CO2 or had been exposed to 475 μl l-1 CO2 for some 9 years. Although the area had been subject to a severe drought and microfaunal populations were lower than previously found, the effects of elevated CO2 on microfaunal populations were broadly similar to those at 4 years. Average populations of the root-feeding L. elongatus increased from 67,000 to 233,000 m-2 (3.48×) compared with a 4.26× increase after 4 years; microbialfeeding nematodes increased slightly, while predacious nematodes showed a 2.0× increase. A pot experiment showed an additive effect of elevated CO2 and L. elongatus abundance in reducing specific root length. That similar effects have been found 4 and 9 years after CO2 enrichment commenced suggests they are real, and emphasises the difference to other sites around the world where much lower responses to elevated CO2 have been found. This, in part, reflects the unique combination of soil, plant and soil biological conditions at each site and confirms the strong effect of soil type and vegetation on soil biological processes. Just as the effects of global climate change on a given region are idiosyncratic, so it seems are the effects of elevated CO2 on soil and ecosystem processes. In part, this reflects our limited understanding of below-ground processes. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Elevated carbon dioxide; Longidorus; Ryegrass; Soil microfauna; Specific root length; Trophic levels","Lolium; Longidorus; Longidorus elongatus; Nematoda; Ovis aries",,,,,,"Allard, V., Newton, P.C.D., Lieffering, M., Soussana, J.F., Carran, R.A., Matthew, C., Increased quantity and quality of coarse soil organic matter fraction at elevated CO2 in a grazed grassland are a consequence of enhanced root growth rate and turnover (2005) Plant Soil, 276, pp. 49-60. , 10.1007/s11104-005-5675-9; Allard, V., Robin, C., Newton, P.C.D., Lieffering, M., Soussana, J.F., Short-term and long-term effects of elevated CO2 on Lolium perenne root exudation and its consequences on soil organic matter turnover and plant (2006) N Yield.
