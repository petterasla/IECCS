In response, Fujitsu has developed facilities management systems called Futuric that make buildings safer and more comfortable by collecting information about equipment in buildings and then making it available for management and control purposes. Lately, however, more importance has been attached to reducing environmental burden by providing energy-conservation functions for entire buildings. The Futuric facilities management systems have various energy conservation functions in their building energy and environment management systems (BEMSs) to support environmental burden reduction. This paper introduces the Futuric systems and describes how they help reduce a building's environmental burden using an example introduction in an office building.",,"Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Global warming; Industrial management; Office buildings; Environmental burden; Facilities management system; Fujitsu Group (CO); Futuric systems; Environmental engineering",,,,,,"Maeeda, M., Facilities management system (2004) Fujitsu Access Review, 13 (1), pp. 57-63; Oka, K., Sakai gas building (2004) Heating Piping & Air Conditioning, 3, pp. 56-70",,,,,,,,,00162523,,FUSTA,,"English","Fujitsu Sci Tech J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-23944494094
