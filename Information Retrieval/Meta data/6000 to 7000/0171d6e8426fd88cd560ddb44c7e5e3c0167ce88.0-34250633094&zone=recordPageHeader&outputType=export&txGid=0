The rate of time-dependent climate change is determined both by the strength of atmosphere-surface climate feedbacks and by the strength of processes that remove heat from the surface to the deep ocean. Here a first small ensemble of coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model experiments in which the parameters that control three key ocean physical processes are perturbed is described. It is found that the perturbations have little impact on the rate of ocean heat uptake, and thus have little impact on the time-dependent rate of global warming. Under the idealized scenario of 1% yr-1 compounded CO2 increase, the spread in the transient climate response is of the order of a few tenths of a degree, in contrast to the spread of order of 1° caused by perturbing atmospheric model parameters. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Computer simulation; Estimation; Oceanography; Probability; Climate response; Coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model; Ocean heat uptake; Perturbed physics; Climate change; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate change; climate modeling; Hadley cell; perturbation; sensitivity analysis; time dependent behavior; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,"Barnett, D.N., Brown, S.J., Murphy, J.M., Sexton, D.M.H., Webb, M.J., Quantifying uncertainty in changes in extreme event frequency in response to doubled CO2 using a large ensemble of GCM simulations (2006) Climate Dyn, 26, pp. 489-511; Brierley, C., (2007) Ocean model uncertainty and time-dependent climate, , projections.
