We incorporated species-specific consumption data from 240 wolf-killed elk carcasses from Yellowstone National Park into stochastic simulation models to link trends in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to food procurement by a guild of scavengers as a function of gray wolf reintroduction. We find that a shift in ENSO towards the El Niño (warming) phase of the cycle coincident with increasing global temperatures reduces carrion for scavengers, particularly those with strong seasonal patterns in resource use such as grizzly bears. Wolves alleviate these warming-induced food shortages by rendering control over this crucial resource to biotic rather than abiotic factors. Ecosystems with intact top predators are likely to exhibit stronger biotic regulation and should be more resistant to climate change than ecosystems lacking them. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Canis lupus; Climate change; El Niño; ENSO; Global warming; Kleptoparasitism; Stability; Trophic; Yellowstone","carrion; climate change; El Nino; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; kleptoparasitism; scavenging (feeding); trophic interaction; North America; United States; Yellowstone National Park; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Canis lupus; Ursus arctos",,,,,,"Blanchard, B.M., Size and growth patterns of the Yellowstone grizzly bear (1987) International Conference of Bear Research and Management, 7, pp. 99-107; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multi-Model Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , 2nd edn.
