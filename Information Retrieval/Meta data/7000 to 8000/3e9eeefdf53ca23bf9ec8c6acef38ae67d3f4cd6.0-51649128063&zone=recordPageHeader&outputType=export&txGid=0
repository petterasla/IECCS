Our results extend previous conclusions that recent Northern Hemisphere surface temperature increases are likely anomalous in a long-term context. Recent warmth appears anomalous for at least the past 1,300 years whether or not tree-ring data are used. If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats. The reconstructed amplitude of change over past centuries is greater than hitherto reported, with somewhat greater Medieval warmth in the Northern Hemisphere, albeit still not reaching recent levels. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate change; Global warming","article; climate change; global climate; greenhouse effect; priority journal; simulation; temperature; Earth (Planet); Temperature; Time Factors; Trees",,,,,,"Folland, C.K., Observed climate variability and change (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, pp. 99-181. , eds Houghton JT, et al, Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK, pp; Jansen, E.J., Palaeoclimate (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
