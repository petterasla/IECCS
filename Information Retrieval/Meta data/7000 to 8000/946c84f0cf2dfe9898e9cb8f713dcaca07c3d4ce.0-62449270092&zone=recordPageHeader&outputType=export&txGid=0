Milk production is the most important source of environmental impacts in cheese production and it is obvious to assume that the milk saving that comes with the use of phospholipase reduces the overall environmental impacts of the final product. Production of industrial phospholipase is, however, also associated with environmental burdens and it is not known whether and to what extent the use of phospholipase is justified by overall environmental improvements. The aim of the present study is therefore to assess the environmental impacts that come with the use of industrial phospholipase in mozzarella production and compare with the savings that come with the avoided milk production. The study addresses mozzarella production in Denmark. Methods: LCA is used as analytical tool and environmental modelling is facilitated in SimaPro 7.1.8 LCA software. Yield improvements refer to full scale industrial application of phospholipase in cheese industry. The study is a comparative analysis and a marginal and market-oriented approach is taken. The study addresses contribution to global warming, acidification, nutrient enrichment, photochemical smog formation, energy consumption and use of agricultural land. Estimation of environmental impact potentials is based on Eco-indicator 95 v.2.1 equivalency factors. Toxicity is addressed by qualitative means. Results: The environmental impacts induced by phospholipase production are small compared with the savings obtained by reduced milk consumption for mozzarella production when all impact indicators are considered. Sensitivity analyses and data quality assessments indicate that this general outcome of the study is robust, although results at the more detailed level are the subject of much variation and uncertainty. Discussion: Transport of the enzyme from producer to mozzarella producer is insignificant and the general outcome of the study is considered applicable to other regions of the world where milk is produced in modern milk production systems. Conclusions: Use of phospholipase as a yield improvement factor is a means of reducing environmental impact of mozzarella production. Recommendations and perspectives: The total annual global warming mitigation potential of phospholipase used in production of mozzarella and other pasta filata products is in the order of 7∈×∈108 kg CO2 equivalents. The use of phospholipase is driven by overall cost savings and it is therefore recommended that the enzyme should be given attention as a cost-efficient means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Biotechnology; Dairy; Enzymatic; LCA; Milk; Pasta filata","phospholipase; acidification; analytic method; article; cheese; computer program; Denmark; energy consumption; environmental factor; food industry; greenhouse effect; nutrient; photochemistry; priority journal; qualitative analysis; sensitivity analysis",,"phospholipase, 9013-93-8",,,,"Berlin, J., Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of Swedish semi-hard cheese (2002) Int Dairy J, 12, pp. 939-953; Cederberg, C., Stadig, M., System expansion and allocation in life cycle assessment of milk and beef production (2003) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 8, pp. 350-356; De Maria, L., Vind, J., Oxenbøll, K.M., Svendsen, A., Patkar, S., Phospholipases and their industrial applications (2007) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 74, pp. 290-300; (2006) Milk and Milk Products in the European Union, , http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/publi/fact/milk/2007_en.pdf, EC European Commission, Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development.
