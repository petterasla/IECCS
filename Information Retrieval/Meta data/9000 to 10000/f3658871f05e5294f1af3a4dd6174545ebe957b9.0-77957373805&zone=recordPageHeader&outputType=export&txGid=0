In this paper, we projected a scenario of European agriculture in a +2°C (above pre-industrial levels) world in order to assess the potential effect of climatic change and variability and to test the effectiveness of different adaptation options. For this purpose, the outputs of HadCM3 General Circulation Model (GCM) were empirically downscaled for current climate (1975-2005) and a future period (2030-2060), to feed a process-based crop simulation model, in order to quantify the impact of a changing climate on agriculture emphasising the impact due to changes in the frequency of extreme events (heat waves and drought). The same climatic dataset was used to compare the effectiveness of different adaptations to a warmer climate strategies including advanced or delayed sowing time, shorter or longer cycle cultivar and irrigation. The results indicated that both changes in mean climate and climate variability affected crop growth resulting in different crop fitting capacity to cope with climate change. This capacity mainly depended on the crop type and the geographical area across Europe. A +2°C scenario had a higher impact on crops cultivated over the Mediterranean basin than on those cultivated in central and northern Europe as a consequence of drier and hotter conditions. In contrast, crops cultivated in Northern Europe generally exhibited higher than current yields, as a consequence of wetter conditions, and temperatures closer to the optimum growing conditions. Simple, no-cost adaptation options such as advancement of sowing dates or the use of longer cycle varieties may be implemented to tackle the expected yield loss in southern Europe as well as to exploit possible advantages in northern regions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Drought; Extreme events; Global warming; Heat wave","agricultural practice; climate change; cultivar; data set; drought; environmental assessment; extreme event; frequency analysis; general circulation model; geographical region; irrigation; numerical model; sowing; temperature effect; yield response; Europe; Mediterranean Sea",,,,,,"Adams, R.M., McCarl, B.A., Mearns, L.O., The effects of spatial scale of climate scenarios on economic assessments: an example from U.S. Agriculture (2003) Clim Change, 60, pp. 131-148; Adger, W.N., Agrawala, S., Mirza, M.M.Q., Conde, C., O'Brien, K., Pulhin, J., Pulwarty, R., Takahashi, K., Assessment of adaptation practices, options, constraints and capacity (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
