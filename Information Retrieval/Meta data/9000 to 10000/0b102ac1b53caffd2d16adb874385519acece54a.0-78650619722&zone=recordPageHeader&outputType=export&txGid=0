All of these phenomena are therefore likely to share a common origin through global climate change. Exceptional patterns for carbon isotope excursions resulted from massive carbon burial during warm intervals of widespread marine anoxic conditions. The many carbon isotope excursions that parallel those for oxygen isotopes can to a large degree be accounted for by the Q10 pattern of respiration for bacteria: As temperature changed along continental margins, where ∼90% of marine carbon burial occurs today, rates of remineralization of isotopically light carbon must have changed exponentially. This would have reduced organic carbon burial during global warming and increased it during global cooling. Also contributing to the δ13C excursions have been release and uptake of methane by clathrates, the positive correlation between temperature and degree of fractionation of carbon isotopes by phytoplankton at temperatures below ∼15°, and increased phytoplankton productivity during ""icehouse"" conditions. The Q10 pattern for bacteria and climate-related changes in clathrate volume represent positive feedbacks for climate change.","Paleoceanography; Paleoclimatology","ice; methane; organic carbon; oxygen; stable isotope; bacterial metabolism; breathing pattern; climate; climate change; conference paper; cooling; fractionation; global change; global climate; greenhouse effect; light; mineralization; nonhuman; Phanerozoic; phytoplankton; positive feedback; priority journal; productivity; species extinction; Bacteria; Carbon Isotopes; Climate Change; Extinction, Biological; Geologic Sediments; Marine Biology; Oxygen Isotopes; Phytoplankton; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,"methane, 74-82-8; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Carbon Isotopes; Oxygen Isotopes",,,,"Berner, R.A., (1990) The Phanerozoic Carbon Cycle, p. 48. , (Oxford, New York); Duarte, C.M., Cebrian, J., The fate of marine autotrophic production (1996) Limnol Oceanogr, 41, pp. 1758-1766; Reimers, C.E., Jahnke, R.A., McCorkle, D.C., Carbon fluxes and burial rates over the continental slope and rise off Central California with implications for the global carbon cycle (1992) Global Biogeochem Cy, 6, pp. 199-224; McKee, B.A., Aller, R.C., Allison, M.A., Bianchi, T.S., Kineke, G.C., Transport and transformation of dissolved and particulate materials on continental margins influenced by major rivers: Benthic boundary layer and seabed processes (2004) Cont Shelf Res, 24, pp. 899-926; Hargrave, B.T., Similarity of oxygen uptake by benthic communities (1969) Limnol Oceanogr, 14, pp. 801-805; Ver, L.M.B., MacKenzie, F.T., Lerman, A., Biogeochemical responses of the carbon cycle to natural and human perturbations: Past, present, and future (1999) Am J Sci, 299, pp. 762-801; Behrenfeld, M.J., Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity (2006) Nature, 444, pp. 752-755; Stanley, S.M., Temperature and biotic crises in the marine realm (1984) Geology, 12, pp. 205-208; Li, Y.-H., (2000) A Compendium of Geochemistry-from the Solar Nebula to the Human Brain, p. 365. , (Princeton Univ Press, Princeton); Zhu, Z., Aller, R.C., Mak, J., (2002) Cont Shelf Res, 22, pp. 2065-2079. , Stable carbon isotope cycling in mobile coastal muds of amapa, Brazil; Lehnert, O., δ13C records across the late silurian lau event: New data from middle paleo-latitudes of northern peri-Gondwana (2007) Palaeogeogr Palaeocl, 245, pp. 227-244. , Prague Basin, Czech Republic; Holser, W.T., A unique geochemical record at the permian/triassic boundary (1989) Nature, 337, pp. 39-44; Coxall, H.K., Wilson, P.A., Palike, H., Lear, C.H., Backman, J., Rapid stepwise onset of antarctic glaciation and deeper calcite compensation in the pacific ocean (2005) Nature, 433, pp. 53-57; Vasquez-Dominguez, E., Vaque, D., Gasol, J.M., Ocean warming enhances respiration and carbon demand of coastal microbial plankton (2007) Glob Change Biol, 13, pp. 1327-1334; Brenchley, P.J., Bathymetric and isotopic evidence for a short-lived Late Ordovician glaciation in a greenhouse period (1994) Geology, 22, pp. 295-298; Sloan, L.C., Walker, J.C.G., Moore Jr., T.C., Rea, D.K., Zachos, J.C., Possible methaneinduced polar warming in the early eocene (1992) Nature, 357, pp. 320-322; Zachos, J.C., A transient rise in tropical sea surface temperature during the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1551-1554; Berner, R.A., Examination of hypotheses for the permo-triassic boundary extinction by carbon cycle modeling (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 99, pp. 4172-4177; Freeman, K.H., Hayes, J.M., Fractionation of carbon isotopes by phytoplankton and estimates of ancient CO2 levels (1992) Global Biogeochem Cy, 6, pp. 185-198; Huber, B.T., Hodell, D.A., Hamilton, C.P., Middle-late cretaceous climate of the southern high latitude: Stable isotope evidence for minimal equator-to-pole gradients (1995) Geol Soc Am Bull, 107, pp. 1164-1191; Hesselbo, S.P., Massive dissociation of gas hydrates during a jurassic oceanic anoxic event (2000) Nature, 406, pp. 392-395; Hsu, K.J., Mass mortality and its environmental and evolutionary consequences (1982) Science, 216, pp. 249-256; Duplessy, J.C., Deepwater source variations during the last climatic cycle and their impact on the global deepwater circulation (1988) Paleoceanography, 3, pp. 343-360; Shackleton, N.J., Carbon-13 in uvigerina: Tropical rainforest history and the equatorial pacific carbonate dissolution cycle (1977) The Fate of Fossil Fuel CO2 in the Oceans, pp. 401-428. , eds NR Anderson and A Malahoff (Plenum, New York); Adams, J.M., Faure, H., Faure-Denard, L., McGlade, J.M., Woodward, F.I., Increases in terrestrial carbon storage from the last glacial maximum to the present (1990) Nature, 348, pp. 711-714; Broecker, W.S., Glacial to interglacial changes in ocean chemistry (1982) Prog Oceanogr, 11, pp. 151-197; Fry, B., Wainright, S.C., Diatom sources of 13C-rich carbon in marine food webs (1991) Mar Ecol-Prog Ser, 76, pp. 149-157","Stanley, S.
