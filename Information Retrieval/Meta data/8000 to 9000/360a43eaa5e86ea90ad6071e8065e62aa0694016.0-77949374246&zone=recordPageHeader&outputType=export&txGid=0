The DICE model has developed a specific reduced-form abatement cost function that is expressed as C(t) = Q(t)α(t)μ(t)β, where C(t) is total cost, Q(t) is total output, μ(t) is the emissions reduction rate, and α and β are fixed parameters. The DICE model uses a reduced-form cost function, which is derived by estimating the marginal cost of emissions reduction as a function of the emissions control rate for different detailed models of abatement costs. The clean development mechanism (CDM) allows some participation of developing countries by authorizing projects that induces low-cost emissions reductions in those countries. The CDM had authorized certified emission reduction (CER) credits amounting to 2.7 billion metric tons of CO2 for the 2008-2012 period.",,,,,,,,"Barrett, S., (2003) Environment and Statecraft, , Oxford, U.K: Oxford University Press; Bernard, A., Paltsev, S., Reilly, J.M., Vielle, M., Viguier, L., Russia's role in the kyoto protocol (2003) MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, Report No. 98, , June; Details on the Framework Convention and the Kyoto Protocol may be found on the convention's website at unfccc.int/2860.phpThe costs of the kyoto protocol: A multi-model evaluation (1999) The Energy Journal, pp. 25-72. , There are many disaggregated integrated assessment models (IAMs) that incorporate differential participation.

Even if the functional form were not log-linear, the basic relationship would be similar and would depend on the average degree of convexity in the relevant range if the separation of countries and industries is as assumedNordhaus, A Question of Balance, , See, and the references in footnote 6 for further discussion; There is an extensive literature on leakage. For example, Barrett writes, ""Free-riding will be exacerbated by a different but related problem: leakage. If a group of countries reduce their emissions, world prices will change. Comparative advantage in the pollution-intensive industries will shift to the non-participating countries. These countries will thus increase their output-and increase their emissions, too-as a direct consequence of the abatement undertaken by participating countries. An effective climate change agreement must plug this leakBarrett, S., Economic incentives and enforcement are crucial to a climate treaty (1997) Weathervane: Perspectives on Policy, , Resources for the Future, December, However, some authors have questioned the importance of leakage in a strategic trade context; Copeland, B.R., Taylor, M.S., Free trade and global warming: A trade theory view of the Kyoto protocol (2005) Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 49, pp. 205-234. , see, Estimated leakage rates in the context of the Kyoto Protocol are as high as 20 percent.
