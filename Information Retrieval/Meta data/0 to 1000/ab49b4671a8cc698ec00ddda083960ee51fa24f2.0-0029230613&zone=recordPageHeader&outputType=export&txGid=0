This is particularly so in the choice of long term electricity production strategies where these have to be balanced against the potential of a very severe disruption of the world's climate due to global warming. In this presentation, the threat of global warming is quantified and scenarios are developed of future predicted energy consumption patterns and their impact on international policies to curb global warming, are analyzed. The conclusion is reached that the threat of global warming is so severe that, on the macro level, an international accepted strategy of utilising a proper balance between all forms of electricity production, is a matter of priority and that all national energy choices should be taken against this framework. Such strategic decisions on the macro level must, however, also translate into the micro level of energy production on topics which include: • - more efficient plant utilisation; • - more effective risk management; • - correct choice and application of technology; and • - better understanding of issues concerning safety, quality and environmental impact. © 1995.",,"Accident prevention; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; International law; Quality assurance; Risk assessment; Electricity production; Energy consumption patterns; Plant utilisation; Risk management; Nuclear energy",,,,,,"Wigley, Raper, (1992) Nature, 357, pp. 293-300; Wigley, (1989) Annual Symposium of the Uranium Institute, , London; Michaelis, (1990) Atomwirtschaft, p. 222; Lashov, Tirpak, (1989) Policy options for stabilising global climate, , EPA, Washington DC; Kohler, Schaumann, Voss, (1990) Atomwirtschaft, p. 484; Erdatmosphäre, eine Internationale Herausforderung (1988) Zwischenbericht der Enquôte - Kommissiön des II Deutschen Bundestages, , Bonn; (1988) Neftel, The Greenhouse Effect, Climatic Change and Ecosystems (SCOPE 29); (1992) Beyond the Limits, , Quoted in, D Meadows, Chelsea Green (US); Rogers, (1990) Environ Sci Technol, 24, p. 428; (1992) Nuclear News; (1992) 1992 IPCC Supplement, , IPCC Scretariat, Geneva; (1992) “The environment”, Supplement to the Economist (UK); Leyden, Proceedings of the Helsinki Symposium (1991) Energy and Electricity Supply and Demand, Key Issue Paper No 1; Haugland, Olsen, Roland, (1992) Energy Policy, pp. 405-419; 1989 Congress of the World Energy Council (WEC)Lemenov, (1991) IAEA Bulletin, 2, p. 20. , See also; Katz, Slowing global warming and sustaining development (1990) Energy Policy, p. 25; US Agency for International Development, (1984) Power Shortages in Developing Countries: Magnitude, Impacts, Solutions and the Role of the Private Sector, , Washington DC; U.S. National Academy of Sciences, The political implications of greenhouse warming (1991) Nuclear Forum, , Quoted in; Cruver, (1990) Power Engineering, p. 39; INFO, (1992) U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, (273), p. 1; King, Schneider, (1991) The First Global Revolution—A Report by the Club of Rome, , Simon & Schuster, London; Semenov, Guthrie, Tatsuta, The future role of nuclear power in the global energy balance (1991) IAEA Bull., 8, pp. 20-24","Stumpf, W.",,,,,,,,03080161,,,,"English","Int.
