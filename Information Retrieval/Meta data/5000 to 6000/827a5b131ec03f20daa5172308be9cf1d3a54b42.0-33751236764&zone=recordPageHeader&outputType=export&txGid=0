It is a significant component of the climate system as it has global linkages through El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other factors. Changes in the land-ocean temperature contrast can have a profound influence on the strength of the monsoon winds and precipitation. Although India is fortunate to have instrumental records of rainfall dating back to the 18th century, it is important to investigate how on geological time scales, the monsoon may have responded to variations in the incoming solar energy, the earth's orbital characteristics and glacial boundary conditions. For reconstructing past monsoon episodes, recourse has to be taken to proxy data as indirect evidence of what the conditions might have been like. There are many high-resolution proxy indicators such as width and density of tree rings in the Himalayan forests, geochemical characteristics of Arabian Sea corals, laminated ocean-floor sediment cores off the west coast of India, lake-bed pollen sequences from northwestern India, and high-elevation ice cores from the Tibetan region. It must be realised that inferences drawn from proxy studies are bound to have limitations and uncertainties and cannot be expected to match the accuracy of analyses carried out with recent meteorological data. However, for studies on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years, there is perhaps no alternative to the use of proxy data. It is now generally agreed that the climate of the Holocene was relatively stable, but was characterised by millennial scale variability and long-term trends including changes in the nature of ENSO. As more results emerge from proxy studies, we would be in a better position to re-construct past monsoons, droughts and floods over the Indian region. If parallels to the present global warming trend were discovered in the historical past, they would help in building better monsoon prediction models. © Geol. Soc.
