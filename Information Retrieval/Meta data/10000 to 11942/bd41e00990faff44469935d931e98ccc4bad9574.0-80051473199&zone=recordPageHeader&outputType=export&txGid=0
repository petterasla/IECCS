The enrichment of soils with charred materials also increases their fertility. This fertilising effect of biochar may be caused by various mechanisms; an acceleration of nutrient cycling has been suggested as one such mechanism. The rate-limiting step in nutrient cycling is thought to be the extracellular enzymatic attack on biological macromolecules. In this study, therefore, the effects of chestnut wood char (specific surface area 2.0 m2 g-1) and of activated carbon (specific surface area approximately 900 m2 g-1) on an extracellular enzymatic reaction involved in the degradation of cellulose (i.e., hydrolysis of cellobiose by β-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger) were investigated. Cellobiose was not adsorbed by chestnut wood char, whereas activated carbon absorbed more than 97% of it. Both charred materials adsorbed more than 99% of β-glucosidase. For chestnut wood char, adsorption of the enzyme caused a decrease of approximately 30% in the reaction rate, whereas for activated carbon, the nearly complete absorption of both substrate and enzyme entirely inhibited the reaction. These results show that β-glucosidase from A. niger retains most of its activity when adsorbed to chestnut wood char and that the reaction it catalyses in nature is only slightly affected by this charred material. On the other hand, a material characterised by a high specific surface area and high porosity, such as activated carbon, can make even a highly soluble substrate unavailable for soil enzymes and therefore completely inhibit the reaction. Thus, charred materials may affect nutrient cycling mainly by regulating the availability of substrates: the degradation of highly soluble substrates may be accelerated by materials with low specific surface area, which maintain an active and protected enzyme pool, whereas materials with high specific surface and high porosity may slow down the degradation by making substrates unavailable. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","β-glucosidase; Activated carbon; Aspergillus niger; Biochar; Cellobiose; Enzymatic activity; Sorption","Aspergillus niger; Biochar; Cellobiose; Enzymatic activities; Glucosidase; Activated carbon; Adsorption; Aspergillus; Climate change; Degradation; Enzyme activity; Fruits; Hydrolysis; Lakes; Nutrients; Reaction rates; Soils; Specific surface area; Substrates; Surfaces; Wood; acceleration; activated carbon; carbon sequestration; climate change; enzyme activity; fungus; global climate; hydrolysis; nutrient cycling; porosity; soil amendment; soil fertility; sorption; surface area; Activated Carbon; Adsorption; Cellobiose; Char; Climates; Enzymatic Activity; Fruits; Glucosidase; Hydrolysis; Lakes; Nutrients; Reaction Kinetics; Sorption; Wood; Aspergillus niger",,,,,,"Bailey, V.L., Fansler, S.J., Smith, J.L., Bolton, H., Reconciling apparent variability in effects of biochar amendment on soil enzyme activities by assay optimization (2011) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 43, pp. 296-301; Cornelissen, G., Gustafsson, Ö., Bucheli, T.D., Jonker, M.T.O., Koelmans, A.A., van Noort, P.C.M., Extensive sorption of organic compounds to black carbon, coal, and kerogen in sediments and soils: mechanisms and consequences for distribution, bioaccumulation, and biodegradation (2005) Environmental Science & Technology, 39, pp. 6881-6895; Daoud, F.B.-O., Kaddour, S., Sadoun, T., Adsorption of cellulase Aspergillus niger on a commercial activated carbon: kinetics and equilibrium studies (2010) Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 75, pp. 93-99; Eveleigh, D.E., Cellulase - a perspective (1987) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A-Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences, 321, pp. 435-447; Glaser, B., Balashov, E., Haumaier, L., Guggenberger, G., Zech, W., Black carbon in density fractions of anthropogenic soils of the Brazilian Amazon region (2000) Organic Geochemistry, 31, pp. 669-678; Glaser, B., Guggenberger, G., Haumaier, L., Zech, W., Persistence of soil organic matter in archaeological soils (Terra Preta) of the Brazilian Amazon region (2001) Sustainable Management of Soil Organic Matter, pp. 190-194. , CABI Publishing, Wallingford, R.M.
