For instance, it was recently revealed that the proposed link between climate change and widespread amphibian declines, putatively caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), was tenuous because it was based on a temporally confounded correlation. Here we provide temporally unconfounded evidence that global El Niño climatic events drive widespread amphibian losses in genus Atelopus via increased regional temperature variability, which can reduce amphibian defenses against pathogens. Of 26 climate variables tested, only factors associated with temperature variability could account for the spatiotemporal patterns of declines thought to be associated with Bd. Climatic predictors of declines became significant only after controlling for a pattern consistent with epidemic spread (by temporally detrending the data). This presumed spread accounted for 59% of the temporal variation in amphibian losses, whereas El Niño accounted for 59% of the remaining variation. Hence, we could account for 83% of the variation in declines with these two variables alone. Given that global climate change seems to increase temperature variability, extreme climatic events, and the strength of Central Pacific El Niño episodes, climate change might exacerbate worldwide enigmatic declines of amphibians, presumably by increasing susceptibility to disease. These results suggest that changes to temperature variability associated with climate change might be as significant to biodiversity losses and disease emergence as changes to mean temperature.","Chytridiomycosis; Climate change; Conservation; El Niño; Emerging infectious disease","Amphibia; article; global climate; infection; pathogenesis; priority journal; temperature; Animal Diseases; Animals; Bufonidae; Climate Change; Disease Susceptibility; Pacific Ocean; Population Dynamics; Time Factors; Amphibia; Atelopus; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Fungi",,,,,,"Raisanen, J., CO2-induced changes in interannual temperature and precipitation variability in 19 CMIP2 experiments (2002) Journal of Climate, 15 (17), pp. 2395-2411; Paaijmans, Kp., Read, A.F., Thomas, M.B., Understanding the link between malaria risk and climate (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 106, pp. 13844-13849; Pascual, M., Dobson, A.P., Bouma, M.J., Underestimating malaria risk under variable temperatures (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 106, pp. 13645-13646; Daszak, P., Cunningham, A.A., Hyatt, A.D., Emerging infectious diseases of wildlife - Threats to biodiversity and human health (2000) Science, 287 (5452), pp. 443-449. , DOI 10.1126/science.287.5452.443; Jones, K.E., Patel, N.G., Levy, M.A., Storeygard, A., Balk, D., Gittleman, J.L., Daszak, P., Global trends in emerging infectious diseases (2008) Nature, 451 (7181), pp. 990-993. , DOI 10.1038/nature06536, PII NATURE06536; Harvell, C.D., Climate warming and disease risks for terrestrial and marine biota (2002) Science, 296, pp. 2158-2162; Lafferty, K.D., The ecology of climate change and infectious diseases (2009) Ecology, 90, pp. 888-900; Rohr, J.R., Raffel, T.R., Romansic, J.M., McCallum, H., Hudson, P.J., Evaluating the links between climate, disease spread, and amphibian declines (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 17436-17441; Hay, S.I., Cox, J., Rogers, D.J., Randolph, S.E., Stern, D.I., Shanks, G.D., Myers, M.F., Snow, R.W., Climate change and the resurgence of malaria in the East African highlands (2002) Nature, 415 (6874), pp. 905-909. , DOI 10.1038/415905a; Bosch, J., Carrascal, L.M., Duran, L., Walker, S., Fisher, M.C., Climate change and outbreaks of amphibian chytridiomycosis in a montane area of Central Spain; is there a link?
