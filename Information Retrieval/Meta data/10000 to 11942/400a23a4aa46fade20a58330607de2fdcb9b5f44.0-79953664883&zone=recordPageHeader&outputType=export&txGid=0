Hydrogen is a flexible storage medium for energy and can be generated by the electrolysis of water. It is more particularly advantageous and efficient when the electrolyzer is simply coupled to a source of renewable electrical energy. This paper examines the operation of alkaline water electrolysis coupled with solar photovoltaic (PV) source for hydrogen generation with emphasis on the electrolyzer efficiency. PV generator is simulated using Matlab/Simulink to obtain its characteristics under different operating conditions with solar irradiance and temperature variations. The experimental alkaline water electrolysis system is built in the fluid mechanics laboratory of Menoufiya University and tested at certain input voltages and currents which are fed from the PV generator. The effects of voltage, solution concentration of electrolyte and the space between the pair of electrodes on the amount of hydrogen produced by water electrolysis as well as the electrolyzer efficiency are experimentally investigated. The water electrolysis of different potassium hydroxide aqueous solutions is conducted under atmospheric pressure using stainless steel electrodes. The experimental results showed that the performance of water electrolysis unit is highly affected by the voltage input and the gap between the electrodes. Higher rates of produced hydrogen can be obtained at smaller space between the electrodes and also at higher voltage input. The maximum electrolyzer efficiency is obtained at the smallest gap between electrodes, however, for a specified input voltage value within the range considered. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.
