The ability of soils to retain water can increase resilience by buffering vegetation communities against precipitation extremes. Little is known, however, about water retention by carbonate-cemented soil horizons, which occur extensively in arid and semiarid ecosystems. It has been speculated that they may significantly modify vertical and temporal distribution of plant-available water (PAW). To investigate this hypothesis, PAW was monitored at three sites in a mixed shrub-grass community in southern New Mexico, USA, across soils with differing degrees of carbonate horizon development: no carbonate horizon, a horizon partially cemented with carbonates (calcic), and a horizon continuously cemented with carbonates (petrocalcic). Results are presented from 3 years that included extremely dry and wet periods. Both carbonate-cemented horizons absorbed and retained significantly greater amounts of PAW for several months following an extremely wet winter and summer compared to the non-carbonate soil. Following a wet summer, continuously cemented horizons retained very high PAW (16-18% volumetric or ~72-80% of soil water holding capacity) through early spring of the following year, more than double the PAW retained by similar depths in the non-carbonate soil. Drying dynamics indicate both carbonate-cemented horizons release stored water into the grass rooting zone during growing seasons following extreme wet events. Water dynamics of these horizons during extreme events provide a mechanism to explain previous observations that perennial grasses exhibit greater resilience to drought when carbonate-cemented horizons occur at shallow depths (<50 cm). Water holding capacity of the entire profile, including horizons cemented with carbonates, should be considered when evaluating the potential resilience of vegetation communities to disturbance, including the increased variability in precipitation expected to occur as a result of global climate change. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Calcic; Chihuahuan Desert; Climate change; Desert grassland; Petrocalcic","calcium carbonate; water; arid environment; calcium carbonate; climate change; drought; dry season; ecosystem resilience; grass; growing season; plant water relations; precipitation (climatology); shrub; soil horizon; soil water; spatial variation; temporal variation; water retention; wet season; analysis of variance; article; climate; ecosystem; metabolism; plant; soil; Analysis of Variance; Calcium Carbonate; Climate; Ecosystem; Plants; Soil; Water; New Mexico; United States; Poaceae",,"calcium carbonate, 13397-26-7, 13701-58-1, 14791-73-2, 471-34-1; water, 7732-18-5; Calcium Carbonate, 471-34-1; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Baumhardt, R.L., Lascano, R.J., Physical and hydraulic properties of a calcic horizon (1993) Soil Sci, 155, pp. 368-375; Birkland, P.W., (1999) Soils and Geomorphology, , 3rd edn, New York: Oxford University Press; Bornyasz, M.A., Graham, R.C., Allen, M.F., Ectomycorrhizae in a soil-weathered granitic bedrock regolith: Linking matrix resources to plants (2005) Geoderma, 126, pp. 141-160; Breshears, D.D., Barnes, F.J., Interrelationships between plant functional types and soil moisture heterogeneity for semiarid landscapes within the grassland/forest continuum: A unified conceptual model (1999) Landsc Ecol, 14, pp. 465-478; Bulloch Jr., H.E., Neher, R.E., (1980) Soil Survey of Dona Ana County Area, New Mexico, , Washingtion, DC: USDA-SCS, U.S. Government Printing Office; Cubasch, U., Meehl, G.A., Boer, G.J., Stouffer, R.J., Dix, M., Noda, A., Senior, C.A., Yap, K.S., Projections of future climate change (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
