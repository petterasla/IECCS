Preliminary results based on sensitivity experiments show that the tropical response attributed to nonlinear processes is less than 10% of the linear response for annual mean climatology. This occurs mainly because the ocean circulations, especially the meridional overturning circulation, tend to change proportionally with external forcings. This work provides a practical estimate of oceanic nonlinear response to global climate change in a complex model system, which in turn may allow the assessment of future climate change from the linear extrapolation of current climate.
