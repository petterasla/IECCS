Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States; Ebi, K.L., EPRI, Palo Alto, CA, United States","In 1990 Congress formed the U.S. Global Change Research Program and required it to conduct a periodic national assessment of the potential impacts of climate variability and change on all regions and select economic/resource sectors of the United States. Between 1998 and 2000, a team of experts collaborated on a health impacts assessment that formed the basis for the first National Assessment's analysis of the potential impacts of climate on human health. The health impacts assessment was integrated across a number of health disciplines and involved a search for and qualitative expert judgment review of data on the potential links between climate events and population health. Accomplishments included identification of vulnerable populations, adaptation strategies, research needs, and data gaps. Experts, stakeholders, and the public were involved. The assessment is reported in five articles in this issue; a summary was published in the April 2000 issue of Environmental Health Perspectives. The assessment report will enhance understanding of ways human health might be affected by various climate-associated stresses and of the need for further empirical and predictive research. Improved understanding and communication of the significance and inevitability of uncertainties in such an assessment are critical to further research and policy development.","Assessment; Climate change; Global warming; Human health impacts; Integrated assessment; Policy; Risk assessment; Uncertainty","article; climate; comprehension; economic aspect; empiricism; environmental impact assessment; expert system; geographic distribution; government; human; interpersonal communication; medical literature; policy; prediction; priority journal; public health; publishing; research; United States; Animals; Climate; Disease Vectors; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Effect; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Policy Making; Public Health; Risk Assessment; United States",,,,,,"Patz, J.A., McGeehin, M.A., Bernard, S.M., Ebi, K.L., Epstein, P.R., Grambsch, A., Gubler, D.J., Rose, J.B., The potential health impacts of climate variability and change for the United States: Executive summary of the report of the health sector of the U.S. National Assessment (2000) Environ Health Perspect, 108, pp. 367-376; Patz, J.A., McGeehin, M.A., Bernard, S.M., Ebi, K.L., Epstein, P.R., Grambsch, A., Gubler, D.J., Rose, J.B., Potential consequences of climate variability and change for human health in the United States Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, , http://www.gcrio.org/nationalassessment, Washington, DC:U.S. Global Change Research Program.
