In total 367 species of macro moth were recorded during this study. Over the 35 years of this study, an increase was recorded in both the overall number of individuals and moth diversity. Mean annual temperature significantly predicted the change in moth diversity but not number of individuals caught. Four of the most consistently abundant species, collectively constituting 27% of the average annual catch, were subjected to more detailed analysis. The three species that emerge during the summer months Eulithis populata (the northern spinach), Hydriomena furcata (july highflier) and Idaea biselata (the small fan-footed wave) became more abundant throughout the study period, (although for the latter species not significantly so). For Eulithis populata and Idaea biselata their emergence time became earlier, over the study period and in Eulithis populata and Hydriomena furcata, the flight duration also became longer. In contrast, the species that emerges as an adult during autumn and winter, Epirrita dilutata (the november moth) did not exhibit a significant change in abundance, emergence date or flight duration in this study. The results suggest that climate change is at least in part, responsible for the observed changes in species dynamics. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Dynamics; Global warming; Habitat stability","abundance; climate change; flight behavior; habitat conservation; moth; population dynamics; species diversity; Eurasia; Europe; Loch Lomond; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Epirrita dilutata; Eulithis; Hexapoda; Hydriomena furcata; Idaea biselata; Lepidoptera; Spinacia oleracea",,,,,,"Asher, J., Warren, M., Fox, R., Harding, P., Jeffcoate, G., Jeffcoate, S., (2001) The Millennium Atlas of Butterflies in Great Britain and Ireland, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK; Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Awmack, C., Bezemer, T.M., Brown, V.K., Butterfield, J., Whittaker, J.B., Herbivory in global climate change research: Direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Glob Chan Biol, 8, pp. 1-16; Conrad, K.F., Perry, J.N., Woiwod, I.P., An abundance-occupancy time-lag during the decline of an Arctiid tiger moth (2001) Ecol Lett, 4, pp. 300-303; Conrad, K.F., Woiwod, I.P., Parsons, M., Fox, R., Warren, M.S., Long-term population trends in widespread British moths (2004) J Insect Cons, 8, pp. 119-136; Conrad, K.F., Woiwod, I.P., Perry, J.N., Long-term decline in abundance and distribution of the garden tiger moth (Arctica caja) in Great Britain (2002) Biol Cons, 106, pp. 329-337; Fox, R., Conrad, K.F., Parsons, M.S., Warren, M.S., Woiwod, I.P., (2006) The State of Britain's Larger Moths, , Butterfly Conservation and Rothamsted Research, Wareham, Dorset; Hill, J.K., Thomas, C.D., Huntley, B., Climate and habitat availability determine 20th century changes in a butterfly's range margin (1999) Proc Roy Soc B, 266, pp. 1197-1206; Luff, M.L., Woiwod, I.P., Insects as indicators of land use change: A European perspective, focusing on moths and ground beetles (1995) Insects in a Changing Environment, pp. 399-422. , In: Harrington R, Stork NE (eds) Academic Press, London; Magurran, A.E., (1988) Ecological Diversity and Its Measurement, , Chapman and Hall, London; Mitchell, J., (2001) Loch Lomondside.
