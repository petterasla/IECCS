Climate modelling shows that global warming will enlarge the potential range of the main vector, Anopheles farauti sensu stricto; by the year 2030 if could extend along the Queensland coast to Gladstone, 800 km south of ifs present limit. Vigilance and a dispassionate assessment of risk are needed to meet this challenge.",,"anopheles; australia; climate; greenhouse effect; malaria; parasite transmission; parasite vector; short survey; Animals; Anopheles; Australia; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Insect Vectors; Malaria",,,,,,,"Bryan, J.H.; Department of Entomology, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD 4072, Australia",,,,,,,,0025729X,,MJAUA,8606659,"English","MED.
