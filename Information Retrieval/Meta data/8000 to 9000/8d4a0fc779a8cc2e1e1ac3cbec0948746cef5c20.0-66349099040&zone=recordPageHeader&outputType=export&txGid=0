Vegetation shifts have profound ecological impacts and are an important climate-ecosystem feedback through their alteration of carbon, water, and energy exchanges of the land surface. Of particular concern is the potential for warmer temperatures to compound the effects of increasingly severe droughts by triggering widespread vegetation shifts via woody plant mortality. The sensitivity of tree mortality to temperature is dependent on which of 2 non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms predominates - temperature-sensitive carbon starvation in response to a period of protracted water stress or temperature-insensitive sudden hydraulic failure under extreme water stress (cavitation). Here we show that experimentally induced warmer temperatures (≈4 °C) shortened the time to drought-induced mortality in Pinus edulis (pinon shortened pine) trees by nearly a third, with temperature-dependent differences in cumulative respiration costs implicating carbon starvation as the primary mechanism of mortality. Extrapolating this temperature effect to the historic frequency of water deficit in the southwestern United States predicts a 5-fold increase in the frequency of regional-scale tree die-off events for this species due to temperature alone. Projected increases in drought frequency due to changes in precipitation and increases in stress from biotic agents (e.g., bark beetles) would further exacerbate mortality. Our results demonstrate the mechanism by which warmer temperatures have exacerbated recent regional die-off events and background mortality rates. Because of pervasive projected increases in temperature, our results portend widespread increases in the extent and frequency of vegetation die-off.","Biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks; Carbon starvation; Drought impacts; Global-change ecology; Pinus edulis","carbon; water; article; controlled study; drought; ecology; energy transfer; hydraulic conductivity; mortality; nonhuman; pine; priority journal; temperature sensitivity; tree; United States; vegetation; water deficit; water stress; wood; growth, development and aging; metabolism; pine; plant leaf; sensitivity and specificity; temperature; time; Pinus edulis; Scolytinae; Tillandsia lineatispica; Carbon; Droughts; Pinus; Plant Leaves; Sensitivity and Specificity; Temperature; Time Factors; Trees",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Allen, C.D., Breshears, D.D., Drought-induced shift of a forest-woodland ecotone: Rapid landscape response to climate variation (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95, pp. 14839-14842; Jentsch, A., Kreyling, J., Beierkuhnlein, C., A new generation of climate-change experiments: Events, not trends (2007) Front Ecol Environ, pp. 65-374; Breshears, D.D., Regional vegetation die-off in response to global-change-type drought (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 15144-15148; Shaw, J.D., Steed, B.E., DeBlander, L.T., Forest inventory and analysis (FIA) annual inventory answers the question: What is happening to pinyon-juniper woodlands?
