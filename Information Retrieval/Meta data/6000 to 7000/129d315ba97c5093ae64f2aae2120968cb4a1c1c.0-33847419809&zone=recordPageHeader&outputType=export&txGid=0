This information has enabled the set-up of a cascade physical model that integrates the Sun-atmosphere-Earth system as a single unit and ties solar corpuscular radiation to global warming through Earth's rotation and atmospheric circulation. Our results suggest that changes in geomagnetic activity, and in the Earth's rotation, could be used as long- and short-term indicators, respectively, of future changes in global air temperature. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"air temperature; atmospheric circulation; Earth rotation; geomagnetism; global warming; solar radiation",,,,,,"Abarca del Rio, R., The influence of global warming in Earth rotation speed (1999) Ann Geophysicae, 17, pp. 806-811. , 10.1007/s005850050809; Abarca del Rio, R., Gambis, D., Salstein, D., Nelson, P., Dai, A., Solar activity and earth rotation variability (2003) J Geodyn, 36, pp. 423-443. , 10.1016/S0264-3707(03)00060-7; Bath, A., (1974) Spectral Analysis in Geophysics, p. 563. , Elsevier New York; Bendat, J.S., Piersol, A.C., (1971) Random Data Analysis: Measurement Procedures, p. 407. , Wiley-Interscience New York; Braginskiy, S.I., Analytical description of the secular variations of the geomagnetic field and the rate of rotation of the Earth (1982) Geomagn Aeron, 22, pp. 88-94; Courtillot, V., Le Mouel, J.L., Geomagnetic secular variation impulses (1984) Nature, 311, pp. 709-716. , 10.1038/311709a0; Ferraro, S., Mazzarella, A., Solar activity and algal bloom occurrences in the Northern Adriatic Sea: Geomagnetic connection (1998) Theor Appl Climatol, 59, pp. 129-134. , 10.1007/s007040050018; Folland, C.K., Rayner, N.A., Brown, S.J., Smith, T.M., Shen, S.S.P., Parker, D.E., Macadam, I., Sexton, D.M.H., Global temperature change and its uncertainties since 1861 (2001) Geophys Res Lett, 28, pp. 2621-2624. , 10.1029/2001GL012877; Jones, P.D., New, M., Parker, D.E., Martin, S., Rigor, I.G., Surface air temperature and its variations over the last 150 years (1999) Rev Geophys, 37, pp. 173-199. , 10.1029/1999RG900002; Legrand, J.P., Simon, P.A., Solar cycle and geomagnetic activity: A review for geophysicists, I; The contributions to geomagnetic activity of shock waves and of solar wind (1989) Ann Geoph, 7, pp. 565-578; Mayaud, P.N., The aa indices: A 100-year series characterizing the magnetic activity (1972) J Geophys Res, 77, pp. 6870-6874; Mazzarella, A., Palumbo, A., Earth's rotation and solar activity (1988) Geophys J, 97, pp. 169-171; Mazzarella, A., Palumbo, A., The lunar nodal induced-signal in climatic and oceanic data over the Western Mediterranean and on its bistable phasing (1994) Theor Appl Climatol, 50, pp. 93-102. , 10.1007/BF00864906; Mazzarella, A., Palumbo, F., Rainfall fluctuations over Italy and their association with solar activity (1992) Theor Appl Climatol, 45, pp. 201-207. , 10.1007/BF00866193; Minobe, S., A 50-70 year climatic oscillation over the North Pacific and North America (1997) Geophys Res Lett, 24, pp. 683-686. , 10.1029/97GL00504; Rossby, C.G., Relation between variation in the intensity of the zonal circulation of the atmosphere and the displacements of the semipermanent centers of action (1939) J Marine Res, 2, pp. 38-50; Satoh, M., Yoshida, S., Response of the atmospheric angular momentum and the length of the day to the surface temperature increase for an aqua planet model (1996) Geophys Res Lett, 23, pp. 2569-2572. , 10.1029/96GL02211; Simon, P.A., Legrand, J.P., Solar cycle and geomagnetic activity: A review for geophysicists, II; The solar sources of geomagnetic activity and their links with sunspot cycle activity (1989) Ann Geoph, 7, pp. 579-594; Stephenson, F.R., Morrison, L.V., Long-term fluctuations in Earth's rotation: 700 BC to AD 1990 (1995) Phil Trans Roy Soc A, 351, pp. 165-202","Mazzarella, A.; Meteorological Observatory, Department of Geophysics and Volcanology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",,,,,,,,0177798X,,,,"English","Theor.
