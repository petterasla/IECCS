Present experience with interactive numerical simulation is discussed and approaches to the inclusion of land hydrology in global climate models are considered. At present, a wide range of answers as to expected changes in surface hydrology is given by nominally similar models. Studies of the effects of tropical deforestation and global warming illustrate this point. -Author",,"global change; hydrology; surface-atmosphere coupling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026291793
