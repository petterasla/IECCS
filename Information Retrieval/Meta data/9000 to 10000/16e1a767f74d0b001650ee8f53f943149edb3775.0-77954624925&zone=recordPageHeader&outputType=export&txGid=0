The method of the expanded system boundaries was employed in order to compare different by-products. The whole stages of disposal involved in the systems such as separate discharge, collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal, were included in the system boundary and evaluated. The Global Warming Potential generated from 1tonne of food wastes for each disposal system was analyzed by the life cycle assessment method. The results showed that 200kg of CO2-eq could be produced from dry feeding process, 61kg of CO2-eq from wet feeding process, 123kg of CO2-eq from composting process, and 1010kg of CO2-eq from landfilling. Feed manufacturing and composting, the common treatment methods currently employed, have been known to be environment friendlier than other methods. However, this study shows that they can negatively affect the environment if their by-products are not appropriately utilized as intended. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental impacts; Food waste management; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Resource recovery","Composting process; Disposal systems; Food waste; Global warming potential; Landfilling; Life-cycle assessments; Resource recovery; System boundary; Treatment methods; Environmental impact; Feeding; Global warming; Life cycle; Natural resources; Recovery; Waste treatment; Waste disposal; carbon dioxide; composting; environmental impact; global warming; industrial waste; life cycle analysis; waste disposal; waste management; article; composting; controlled study; dry feeding; environmental impact; environmental management; food waste disposal; greenhouse effect; landfill; life cycle assessment; priority journal; recycling; risk assessment; waste disposal; waste management; wet feeding; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Garbage; Global Warming; Methane; Waste Management",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Bae, J.K., Kim, Y.K., Choi, H.K., The circulation status and prospects for the demand of compost from food waste (2006) J Korea Org Resour Recycl Assoc, 14 (1), pp. 31-49; Banar, M., Cokaygil, Z., Oxkan, A., Life cycle assessment of solid waste management options for Eskisehir, Turkey (2009) Waste Manage, 29, pp. 54-62; Batool, S.A., Chuadhry, M.N., The impact of municipal solid waste treatment methods on greenhouse gas emissions in Lahore, Pakistan (2009) Waste Manage, 29, pp. 63-69; Chen, T.C., Lin, C.F., Greenhouse gases emissions from waste management practices using life cycle inventory model (2008) J Hazard Mater, 155, pp. 23-31; De Feo, G., Malvano, C., The use of LCA in selecting the best MSW management system (2009) Waste Manage, 29, pp. 1902-1915; EC (European Commission).
