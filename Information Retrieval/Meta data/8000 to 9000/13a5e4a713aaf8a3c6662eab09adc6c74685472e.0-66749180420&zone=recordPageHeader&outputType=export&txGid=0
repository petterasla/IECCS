Disturbance associated with warming permafrost can change microclimate and expose areas of ion-rich mineral substrate for colonization by plants. Consequently, the response of vegetation to warming air temperatures may differ significantly from disturbed to undisturbed tundra. Across a latitudinal air temperature gradient, we tested the hypothesis that the microenvironment in thaw slumps would be warmer and more nutrient rich than undisturbed tundra, resulting in altered plant community composition and increased green alder (Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa) growth and reproduction. Our results show increased nutrient availability, soil pH, snow pack, ground temperatures, and active layer thickness in disturbed terrain and suggest that these variables are important drivers of plant community structure. We also found increased productivity, catkin production, and seed viability of green alder at disturbed sites. Altered community composition and enhancement of alder growth and reproduction show that disturbances exert a strong influence on deciduous shrubs that make slumps potential seed sources for undisturbed tundra. Overall, these results indicate that accelerated disturbance regimes have the potential to magnify the effects of warming temperature on vegetation. Consequently, understanding the relative effects of temperature and disturbance on Arctic plant communities is critical to predicting feedbacks between northern ecosystems and global climate change. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Disturbance ecology; Green alder; Ground ice; Low Arctic; Mackenziedelta; Permafrost; Shrub encroachment; Tall shrub; Thermokarst","air temperature; climate change; environmental change; environmental disturbance; global change; global warming; microclimate; permafrost; thermokarst; vegetation dynamics; Canada; Mackenzie Delta; North America; Northwest Territories; Alnus; Alnus viridis",,,,,,"Anisimov, O., Reneva, S., Permafrost and changing climate: The Russian perspective (2006) Ambio, 35, pp. 169-175; Anthelme, F., Cornillon, L., Brun, J.J., Secondary succession of Alnus viridis (Chaix) DC. in Vanoise National Park, France: Coexistence of sexual and vegetative strategies (2002) Annals of Forest Science, 59, pp. 419-428; Barbour, M.G., Billings, W.D., (2000) North American Terrestrial Vegetation, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Bartleman, A.P., Miyanishi, K., Burn, C.R., Cote, M.M., Development of vegetation communities in a retrogressive thaw slump near Mayo, Yukon Territory: A 10-year assessment (2001) Arctic, 54, pp. 149-156; Bliss, L.C., Cantlon, J.E., Succession on river alluvium in northern Alaska (1957) American Midland Naturalist, 58, pp. 452-469; Bohn, H.L., McNeal, B.L., O'Connor, G.A., (2001) Soil Chemistry, , Wiley, New York; Bret-Harte, M.S., Shaver, G.R., Chapin, F.S., Primary and secondary stem growth in Arctic shrubs: Implications for community response to environmental change (2002) Journal of Ecology, 90, pp. 251-267; Burn, C.R., Cryostratigraphy, paleogeography, and climate change during the early Holocene warm interval, western Arctic coast, Canada (1997) Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 34, pp. 912-925; Burn, C.R., Friele, P.A., Geomorphology, vegetation succession, soil characteristics and permafrost in retrogressive thaw slumps near Mayo, Yukon Territory (1989) Arctic, 42, pp. 31-40; Burn, C.R., Lewkowicz, A.G., Retrogressive thaw slumps (1990) Canadian Geographer, 34, pp. 273-276; Chapin, F.S., McGuire, A.D., Randerson, J., Arctic and Boreal ecosystems of western North America as components of the climate system (2000) Global Change Biology, 6, pp. 211-223; Chapin, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Laundre, J.A., Responses of Arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Chapin, F.S., Sturm, M., Serreze, M.C., Role of land-surface changes in Arctic summer warming (2005) Science, 310, pp. 657-660; Chapin, F.S., Walker, L.R., Fastie, C.L., Sharman, L.C., Mechanisms of primary succession following deglaciation at Glacier Bay, Alaska (1994) Ecological Monographs, 64, pp. 149-175; Clarke, K.R., Gorley, R.N., (2001) Primer V5: Users Manual/Tutorial, , Primer-E Ltd Plymouth, MA; Davis, A.J., Jenkinson, L.S., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Wood, S., Making mistakes when predicting shifts in species range in response to global warming (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 783-786; Duk-Rodkin, A., Lemmen, D.S., Glacial history of the Mackenzie region (2000) The Physical Environment of the Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories: A Base Line for the Assessment of Environmental Change.
