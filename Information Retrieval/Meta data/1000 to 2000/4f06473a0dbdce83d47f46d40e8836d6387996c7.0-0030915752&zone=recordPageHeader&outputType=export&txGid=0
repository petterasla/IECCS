We have developed a database to estimate life-cycle efficiencies and greenhouse-gas emissions. Next, we define sustainability limitations on resource depletion and emissions. Based on these concepts, the present world energy system is judged to be unsustainable. Mitigation measures such as disposal of CO2 and solar power generation are evaluated utilizing the concept. We show how sustainability influences the cost-effectiveness of measures taken.",,,,,,,,"Matsuhashi, R., Hikíta, K., Ishitani, H., Ultra-long term scenario for sustainable development considering CO2 constraints (1995) 11th Conf. on Energy Systems and Economics, pp. 217-222. , Japan Society for Energy and Resources, Tokyo January; A research needs assessment for the capture, utilization and disposal of carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel-fired power plants (1993) Executive Summary, DOE/ER-30194, 1. , Washington D.C.
