District heating systems are centralized systems that provide heat for residential and commercial buildings in a community. While various renewable and conventional energy sources can be used in such systems, many stakeholders are interested in choosing the feasible option with the least environmental impacts. This paper evaluates and compares environmental burdens of alternative energy source options for the base-load of a district heating center in Vancouver, British Columbia (BC) using the life cycle assessment method. The considered energy sources include natural gas, wood pellet, sewer heat, and ground heat. Methods The life cycle stages considered in the LCA model cover all stages from fuel production, fuel transmission/ transportation, construction, operation, and finally demolition of the district heating system. The impact categories were analyzed based on the IMPACT 2002+ method. Results and discussion On a life-cycle basis, the global warming effect of renewable energy options were at least 200 kgeqCO2 less than that of the natural gas option per MWh of heat produced by the base-load system. It was concluded that less than 25% of the upstream global warming impact associated with the wood pellet energy source option was due to transportation activities and about 50% of that was resulted from wood pellet production processes. In comparison with other energy options, the wood pellets option has higher impacts on respiratory of inorganics, terrestrial ecotoxicity, acidification, and nitrification categories. Among renewable options, the global warming impact of heat pump options in the studied case in Vancouver, BC, were lower than the wood pellet option due to BC's low carbon electricity generation profile. Ozone layer depletion and mineral extraction were the highest for the heat pump options due to extensive construction required for these options. Conclusions Natural gas utilization as the primary heat source for district heat production implies environmental complications beyond just the global warming impacts. Diffusing renewable energy sources for generating the base-load district heat would reduce human toxicity, ecosystem quality degradation, global warming, and resource depletion compared to the case of natural gas. Reducing fossil fuel dependency in various stages of wood pellet production can remarkably reduce the upstream global warming impact of using wood pellets for district heat generation. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","District heating systems; Environmental impacts; Global warming; Life cycle assessment; Renewable energy; Wood pellets","natural gas; article; Canada; controlled study; ecotoxicity; energy resource; energy transfer; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; priority journal; renewable energy; soil acidification; thermogenesis; traffic and transport",,"natural gas, 8006-14-2",,,,"Cement and structural concrete products (2005) Life Cycle Inventory Update #2, , Athena Sustainable Materials Institute, Ottawa, Canada; Cuddihy, J., Kennedy, C., Byer, P., Energy use in Canada: Environmental impacts and opportunities in relationship to infrastructure systems (2005) Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 32 (1), pp. 1-15. , DOI 10.1139/l04-100; Doll, R., Effects of exposure to vinyl chloride.
