This paper focuses on energy use and energy recovery in waste management and outlines how these aspects should be addressed consistently in a GHG perspective. Essential GHG emission data for the most common fuels, electricity and heat are provided. Average data on electricity provision show large variations from country to country due to different fuels being used and different efficiencies for electricity production in the individual countries (0.007-1.13 kg CO 2-eq. kWh -1). Marginal data on electricity provision show even larger variations (0.004-3 kg CO 2-eq. kWh -1). Somewhat less variation in GHG emissions is being found for heat production (0.01-0.69 kg CO 2-eq. kWh -1). The paper further addresses allocation principles and the importance of applying either average or marginal energy data, and it discusses the consequences of introducing reduction targets on CO 2 emissions. All discussed aspects were found to significantly affect the outcome of GHG accounts suggesting transparent reporting to be critical. Recommendations for use of average/marginal energy data are provided.","CO2 accounting; Energy recovery; Energy use; Global warming; Greenhouse gas; Waste management","Average data; Electricity production; Energy data; Energy recovery; Energy systems; Energy use; GHG emission; Heat production; Marginal data; Reduction targets; Waste management systems; Carbon monoxide; Energy conversion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Waste management; biogas; carbon dioxide; fuel; carbon dioxide; emission control; energy use; global warming; greenhouse gas; heat production; waste management; waste technology; accounting; air pollution; anaerobic digestion; biofuel production; electricity; energy balance; energy consumption; energy recovery; energy yield; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; incineration; industrial waste; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; process technology; review; thermogenesis; waste management; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Electricity; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Waste Management",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Björklund, A., Finnveden, G., Recycling revisited - Life cycle comparisons of waste management strategies (2005) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 41, pp. 83-102; (2008) Energistatistik 2007 (Energy statistics 2007, in Danish), , DEA (Danish Energy Authority) (ed.).
