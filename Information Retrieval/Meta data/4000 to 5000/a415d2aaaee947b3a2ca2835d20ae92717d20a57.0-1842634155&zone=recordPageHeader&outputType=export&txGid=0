Fecundity had a curvilinear response, with an optimum at 24 or 26°C, which is 4 to 6°C above the local mean daytime temperatures. Longevity of nymphal stage was negatively and linearly correlated (r2 = 0.967) with daytime temperature. Intrinsic rate of population increase (rm) and relative growth rate were significantly higher at 26°C than at 20°C. Fecundity and rm were negatively correlated with total phenolic concentration in needles. Temperature affected concentrations of some individual resin acids in needles and stems, while concentrations of monoterpenes, total phenolics, starch, and total nitrogen in needles were not affected by temperature. Seedlings grown at 24°C achieved the greatest biomass. Results support the protein competition hypothesis, which predicts no changes in the concentration of plant phenolics with small temperature increases. However, at 26°C the low starch/nitrogen ratio and low total phenolic concentration may partly explain increased fecundity of aphids.",,"Biomass; Correlation methods; Global warming; Nutrition; Seed; Starch; Reproductive capacity; Seedlings; Forestry; aphid; global warming; host-parasite interaction; reproduction; seasonal variation; seedling; temperature; Adelgidae; Aphididae; Hemiptera; Hexapoda; Insecta; Lachnidae; Pinus sylvestris; Schizolachnus pineti",,,,,,"Allen, S.E., (1989) Chemical Analysis of Ecological Materials. 2nd Ed., , Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, U.K; Ayres, M.P., Plant defense, herbivory, and climate change (1993) Biotic Interactions and Global Change, pp. 74-94. , Edited by P.M.
