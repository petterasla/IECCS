Researchers have developed alternative isomers, such as R-1234yf and several other similar isomers that are expected to fulfil the requirements of the European Union's F-gas regulations to be implemented by January 1, 2011. A team of researchers have estimated fundamental thermodynamic parameters and properties of a number of these isomers to demonstrate their potential for having less impact on global warming. Investigations have revealed that R-1234ze(Z) is the lowest pressure refrigerant that has the potential to minimize the adverse impacts of global warming. It is also revealed to have the lowest heat transfer performance potential. Another isomer that has emerged as a suitable refrigerantr is the R-1234zf that has the highest pressure and greatest heat transfer performance potential.",,"European Union; Gas regulations; Global warming potential; Heat transfer performance; Pressure refrigerant; Research and development; Thermodynamic parameter; Global warming; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Laws and legislation; Parameter estimation; Propylene; Refrigerants; Research; Structural panels; Isomers",,,,,,"(2007) The Physical Science Basis-Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change, , IPCC.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP.
