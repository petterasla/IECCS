In particular, the summers in the 1990s had Mediterranean-like fluctuations with warm spells, rainstorms of 'double' intensity, flooding, and landslides in the mountains. If and how these extremes are connected with global warming due to an increasing greenhouse effect is an open question. However, we feel justified, both for theoretical and practical reasons, in making the following recommendations for future research: Continued observation and information on extreme erosional events and natural hazards are important in order to clarify their climatic links and for safer environmental management for the benefit of people who work or are tourists in the mountains and downstream areas. It is also necessary to improve our knowledge of the connections between local weather extremes and regional climatic trends, e.g. through reconstruction of the former frequency of events during periods of rising temperatures. Two kinds of erosional processes and natural hazards, which may increase in frequency during a climatic warming, are discussed: i) snowmelt-triggered floods and slushflows in spring; and ii) rainstorm-triggered floods and debris flows in summer and autumn.",,"erosion; extreme event; flood; landslide; mountain region; natural hazard; Scandinavia",,,,,,"Rapp, A., Recent development of mountain slopes in Karkevagge and surroundings, Northern Scandinavia (1960) Geogr Ann., 42, pp. 71-200; Nyberg, R., (1985) Debris Flows and Slush Avalanches in Northern Swedish Lappland, 222p. , Lunds Univ.
