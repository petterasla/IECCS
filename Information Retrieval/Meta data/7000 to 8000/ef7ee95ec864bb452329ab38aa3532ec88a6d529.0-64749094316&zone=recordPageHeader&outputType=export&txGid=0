Sequestering CO2 in deep geological formations has been proposed as a long-term solution to help stabilize CO2 levels. However, before such technology can be developed and implemented, a basic understanding of H2O-CO2 systems and the chemical interactions of these fluids with the host formation must be obtained. Important issues concerning mineral stability, reaction rates, and carbonate formation are all controlled or at least significantly impacted by the kinetics of rock-water reactions in mildly acidic, CO2-saturated solutions. Basalt has recently been identified as a potentially important host formation for geological sequestration. Dissolution kinetics of the Columbia River Basalt (CRB) were measured for a range of temperatures (25-90 °C) under mildly acidic to neutral pH conditions using the single-pass flow-through test method. Under anaerobic conditions, the normalized dissolution rates for CRB decrease with increasing pH (3 ≤ pH ≤ 7) with a slope, η, of -0.15 ± 0.01. Activation energy, Ea, has been estimated at 32.0 ± 2.4 kJ mol-1. Dissolution kinetics measurements like these are essential for modeling the rate at which CO2-saturated fluids react with basalt and ultimately drive conversion rates to carbonate minerals in situ. © 2009.",,"Acidic conditions; Anaerobic conditions; Carbonate formations; Chemical interactions; Columbia river basalts; Contributing factors; Conversion rates; Dissolution kinetics; Dissolution rates; Flow-through tests; Geological formations; Geological sequestrations; Global climate changes; In-situ; Long-term solutions; Neutral ph; Saturated fluids; Saturated solutions; Water reactions; Activation energy; Basalt; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Climate change; Minerals; Reaction rates; Silica; Dissolution; acidity; basalt; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolution; experimental study; temperature effect; Columbia River; North America; Passiflora",,,,,,"Anbeek, C., Vanbreemen, N., Meijer, E.L., Vanderplas, L., The dissolution of naturally weathered feldspar and quartz (1994) Geochim.
