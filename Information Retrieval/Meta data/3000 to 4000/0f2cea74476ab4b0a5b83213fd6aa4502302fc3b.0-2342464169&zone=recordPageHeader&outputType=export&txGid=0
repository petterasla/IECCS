Analysis of the past 50 years in transport shows that adoption of radically new technology has been comparatively slow. Travel volumes and vehicle fleets have risen roughly in step with national income. The next half-century, however, will likely see major changes in transport technology and fuels, in response to perceived constraints like oil depletion and global warming. The inevitable uncertainty in long-term forecasting will be exacerbated by these constraints. A break in the travel/income relationship, as has already happened with the energy/income relationship, is also probable. Responding to an uncertain future will prove difficult if change is left largely to market forces. Instead, a larger role for government can both reduce uncertainty and provide us with a more sustainable transport system.","Air transport; Future prediction; Global travel; Historical travel data; Possible futures; Preferred futures; Probable futures; Surface transport; Technology forecasting; Transport technology","Constraint theory; Crude petroleum; Forecasting; Global warming; Planning; Project management; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Future predictions; Global travel; Historical travel data; Possible features; Preferred futures; Probable futures; Surface transport; Transport technology; Air transportation",,,,,,"(1996) The Melbourne City Link Prospectus, , Transurban, Melbourne; Conger, T., Air transport (1996) Encyclopedia of the Future, , G.
