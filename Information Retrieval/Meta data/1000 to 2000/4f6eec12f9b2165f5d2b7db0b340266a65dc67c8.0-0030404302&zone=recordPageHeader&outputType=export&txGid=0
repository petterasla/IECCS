A model incorporating development stage theory is built and used to calculate by region the world's economic growth, population growth, energy supply and demand, CO2 emissions and other items up to the end of the 21st century. Results indicated that if in 2100 world population is about 10 billion, world GDP is US$200 trillion, and CO2 emissions are 10 billion tonnes, there will be fairly good prospects for solving the North-South, fossil fuel exhaustion and global warming problems. Making this scenario happen will require accelerating development of the developing countries so they quickly join the ranks of the developed countries, expediting the shift to renewable energy in the developed countries by imposing carbon taxes, transferring energy savings technologies from the developed to the developing countries, and other efforts.",,"Development stage theory; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Mathematical models; Population statistics; Problem solving; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Global warming; carbon emissions; developing world; development increase; development level; energy technology; environmental economics; global warming; population growth",,,,,,,"Murot, Y.; Shonan Econometrics Inc., 3-231 Kataseyama, Fujisawa Kanagawa 251, Japan",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030404302
