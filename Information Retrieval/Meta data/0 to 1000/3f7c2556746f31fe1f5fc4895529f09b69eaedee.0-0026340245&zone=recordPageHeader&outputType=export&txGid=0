Box 7105, Tikipunga, Whangarei, New Zealand","The significance of temperature in determining the northernmost limit of trout in New Zealand is discussed, and the river temperature records available suggest that high winter temperatures, rather than high summer temperatures are involved. The predicted climate changes consequent on increased concentrations of atmospheric gases, are used to predict changes in trout distribution. A 1.5 °C increase is likely to result in a contraction of the distribution of brown trout in northern areas, but the effects elsewhere on brown trout would be limited. A 3 °C increase is likely to eliminate both species from borthern latitudes, while heat stress could alter distributions of both species throughout the country. The possibilities of genetic responses to the changes are discussed. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","brown trout; egg incubation; global warming; latitudinal distribution; rainbow trout","brown trout; global warming; rainbow trout; temperature limit; trout; New Zealand; Mykiss; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",,,,,,"Allen, K.R., Cunningham, B.T., New Zealand Angling 1947–52 (1957) N.Z.
