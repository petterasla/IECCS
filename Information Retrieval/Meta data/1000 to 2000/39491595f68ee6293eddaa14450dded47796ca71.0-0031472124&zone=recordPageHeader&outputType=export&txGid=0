The worldwide project within the Framework Convention on Climate Change was generated by the initiative of United Nations, to examine this effect and better understand how the GHG increase in the atmosphere might change the climate in the future, how ecosystems and societies in different regions of the world should adapt to these changes and what must policymakers do for the mitigation of that effect. Estonia is one of more than 150 countries which signed the Framework Convention on Climate Change at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. In 1994, a new project, Estonian Country Study, was initiated within the U.S. Country Studies Program. The project will help to compile the GHG inventory for Estonia, investigate the impact of climate change on Estonian ecosystems, and the economy, as well as to formulate national strategies for Estonia to address global climate change.",,"climate change; emission inventory; emissions monitoring; greenhouse gas; greenhouse gas emission; Estonia",,,,,,"(1991) Statistical Yearbook., , Statistical Office of Estonia.
