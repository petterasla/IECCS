The Omura Bay population, consisting of approximately 300 individuals, is the smallest of five populations inhabiting Japanese waters. It is a relatively new population that established after the global warming that took place approximately 9000 years ago. To observe whether these porpoises appear in the major corridor to the ocean from Omura Bay, we used acoustic monitoring to record occurrences of finless porpoises from November 2007 to May 2009. A stereo acoustic event recorder recorded the intensity and the sound source direction of biosonar signals, providing independent traces of sound sources corresponding to each detected animal. A total of 226 individuals were detected over the 1.5-year monitoring period, of which 76% occurred at night and 73% occurred during March and April. We compared the presence of porpoises to the Japanese anchovy catch in Omura Bay and the Hario Strait over the same period. Results suggested that possible reductions in anchovy resources in the bay could attract porpoises to the outside of their normal habitat. In total, 70% of the porpoise recordings took place when the tidal current was moving out of Omura Bay. Porpoises might follow the prey that are transported out of the bay due to the strong outbound current. The finless porpoises confined to the bay might extend their swimming area if prey is available. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",,"bioacoustics; coastal water; comparative study; diurnal variation; global warming; monitoring system; porpoise; prey availability; seasonality; sonar; swimming; tidal current; Haro Strait; Japan; Kyushu; Nagasaki [Kyushu]; Omura Bay; Animalia; Engraulidae; Engraulis japonicus; Neophocaena phocaenoides; Phocoenidae",,,,,,"Akamatsu, T., Wang, D., Wang, K., Off-axis sonar beam pattern of free-ranging finless porpoises measured by a stereo pulse event data logger (2005) J Acoust Soc Am, 117, pp. 3325-3330; Akamatsu, T., Teilmann, J., Miller, L.A., Tougaard, J., Dietz, R., Wang, D., Wang, K., Naito, Y., Comparison of echolocation behaviour between coastal and riverine porpoises (2007) Deep-Sea Research II, 54, pp. 290-297; Akamatsu, T., Wang, D., Wang, K., Li, S., Dong, S., Scanning sonar of rolling porpoises during prey capture dives (2010) J Exp Biol, 213, pp. 146-152; Aoki, I., Tsuruta, Y., Observations on the Recatchive Behaviour of Japanese Anchovy Engrauiis japonica in captivity (1989) Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi, 55, pp. 255-259; Au, W.W.L., Kastelein, R.A., Rippe, T., Schooneman, N.M., Transmission beam pattern and echolocation signals of a harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena (1999) J Acoust Soc Am, 106, pp. 3699-3705; Azeta, M., Some consideration on the high mortality during the larval stage of fish with special reference to the fluctuation of population-based on the population dynamics investigations of early life history of anchovy- (1981) Gyogyou Shigen Kenkyukaigi Houkoku, 22, pp. 7-28; Jefferson, T.A., Preliminary analysis of geographic variation in cranial morphometrics of the finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) (2002) Raffles Bull Zool Supplement, 10, pp. 3-14; Kamminga, C., Echolocation signal type of odontocetes (1988) Animal Sonar: Processes and Performance, pp. 9-22. , P.
