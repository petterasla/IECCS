Erwin Consulting Ecologist, Inc., 2077 Bayside Parkway, Ft Myers, FL 33901, United States","Global climate change is recognized as a threat to species survival and the health of natural systems. Scientists worldwide are looking at the ecological and hydrological impacts resulting from climate change. Climate change will make future efforts to restore and manage wetlands more complex. Wetland systems are vulnerable to changes in quantity and quality of their water supply, and it is expected that climate change will have a pronounced effect on wetlands through alterations in hydrological regimes with great global variability. Wetland habitat responses to climate change and the implications for restoration will be realized differently on a regional and mega-watershed level, making it important to recognize that specific restoration and management plans will require examination by habitat. Floodplains, mangroves, seagrasses, saltmarshes, arctic wetlands, peatlands, freshwater marshes and forests are very diverse habitats, with different stressors and hence different management and restoration techniques are needed. The Sundarban (Bangladesh and India), Mekong river delta (Vietnam), and southern Ontario (Canada) are examples of major wetland complexes where the effects of climate change are evolving in different ways. Thus, successful long term restoration and management of these systems will hinge on how we choose to respond to the effects of climate change. How will we choose priorities for restoration and research? Will enough water be available to rehabilitate currently damaged, water-starved wetland ecosystems? This is a policy paper originally produced at the request of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and incorporates opinion, interpretation and scientific-based arguments. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Arctic wetlands; Carbon sink; Climate change; Freshwater marsh and forests; Mangroves; Mekong river delta; Peatlands; Salt marsh; Seagrasses; Southern Ontario; Sundarban; Wetland hydrology; Wetland restoration; Wetlands","arctic environment; carbon sink; climate change; delta; forest ecosystem; global climate; habitat restoration; peatland; restoration ecology; seagrass; vulnerability; wetland; Asia; Canada; Eurasia; Ganges Delta; North America; Ontario [Canada]; South Asia; Sundarbans; Rhizophoraceae",,,,,,"Ali, A., Numerical investigation into retardation of flood-water outflow through the Meghna rice in Bangladesh due to SW monsoon wind (1995) Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 41, pp. 689-704; Ali, A., Rahman, H., Chowdhury, S.S.H., River discharge storm surges and tidal interactions in the Meghna river mouth in Bangladesh (1997) Mausam, 48, pp. 531-540; Bacon, P.R., Template for evaluation of impacts of sea level rise on Caribbean coastal wetlands (1994) Ecol Eng, 3, pp. 171-186; Belyea, L.R., Malmer, N., Carbon sequestration in peatland: Patterns and mechanisms of response to climate change (2004) Glob Chang Biol, 10, pp. 1043-1052; Briggs, J., Large, D.J., Snape, C., Drage, T., Whittles, D., Cooper, M., MacQuaker, J.H.S., Spiro, B.F., Influence of climate and hydrology on carbon in an early Miocene peatland (2007) Earth Planet Sci Lett, 253, pp. 445-454; Burkett, V., Kusler, J., Climate change: Potential impacts and interactions in wetlands of the United States (2000) J Am Water Resour Assoc, 36, pp. 313-320; Kartierung der Auengebiete von nationaler Bedeutung (1993) Schriftenreihe Umwelt, 199. , BUWAL Bern Switzerland; Carroll, R., Pohll, G., Tracy, J., Winter, T., Smith, R., Simulation of a semipermanent wetland basin in the cottonwood lake area, East-Central North Dakota (2005) J Hydrol Engineer, 10, pp. 70-84. , 1; Changnon, S.A., Huff, F.A., Hsu, C.F., Relations between precipitation and shallow groundwater in Illinois (1988) J Clim, 1, pp. 1239-1250; Chen, R.H., Twilley, R.R., A gap dynamic model of mangrove forest development along gradients of soil salinity and nutrient resources (1998) J Ecol, 86, pp. 37-51; Cunderlik, J.M., Simonovic, S.P., Hydrological extremes in a southwestern Ontario river basin under future climate conditions (2005) Hydrol Sci-J Sci Hydrol, 50, pp. 631-654. , 4; Dankers, R., Christensen, O.B., Climate change impact on snow coverage, evaporation and river discharge in the sub-Arctic tana basin, Northern Fennoscandia (2005) Clim Change, 69, pp. 367-392; Day, J.W., Narras, J., Clairain, E., Johnston, J., Justic, D., Kemp, G.P., Ko, J.Y., Yanez-Arancibia, A., Implications of global climatic change and energy cost and availability for the restoration of the Mississippi delta (2005) Ecol Eng, 24, pp. 253-265; Ellison, J.C., Mangrove retreat with rising sea-level, Bermuda (1993) Est Coast Shelf Sci, 37, pp. 75-87; Ellison, J.C., Pernetta, J., Leemans, R., Elder, D., Humphrey, S., Climate change and seal level rise impacts on mangrove ecosystems (1994) Impacts of Climate Change on Ecosystems and Species: Marine and Costal Ecosystems, pp. 11-30. , IUCN Gland; Ellison, A.M., Farnsworth, E.J., Anthropogenic disturbance to Caribbean mangrove ecosystems: Past impacts, current trends, and future impacts (1996) Biotropica, 28, pp. 549-565; Ellison, A.M., Farnsworth, E.J., Simulated sea level change alters anatomy, physiology, growth, and reproduction of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.)
