Scenarios of future precipitation and ambient temperature were in turn used to evaluate habitat suitability of five ungulate populations and to rank their vulnerability to global climate change in the park. Preliminary results suggest that ambient temperatures may rise with a doubling of atmospheric CO2, and precipitation will be more variable. The vulnerability assessment results suggest that all the ungulates, especially T. angasi, could be highly susceptible to climate induced changes in habitat and food supply.",,"climatic change; nyala; Malawi, Lengwe National Park; Tragelaphus angasii; Ungulata",,,,,,,"Mkanda, F.X.; Dept of National Parks and Wildlife, PO Box 30131, Lilongwe 3, Malawi",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030458130
