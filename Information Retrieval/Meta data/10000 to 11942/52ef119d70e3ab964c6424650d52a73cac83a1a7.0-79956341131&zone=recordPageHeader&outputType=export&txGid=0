One such energy resource is fossil oil extracted from the seabed at offshore oil platforms. This type of oil production causes continuous environmental pollution from drilling waste, discharge of large amounts of produced water, and accidental spills. Methods and principal findings: Samples from natural populations of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in two North Sea areas with extensive oil production were investigated. Exposure to and uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were demonstrated, and biomarker analyses revealed adverse biological effects, including induction of biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress, altered fatty acid composition, and genotoxicity. Genotoxicity was reflected by a hepatic DNA adduct pattern typical for exposure to a mixture of PAHs. Control material was collected from a North Sea area without oil production and from remote Icelandic waters. The difference between the two control areas indicates significant background pollution in the North Sea. Conclusion: It is most remarkable to obtain biomarker responses in natural fish populations in the open sea that are similar to the biomarker responses in fish from highly polluted areas close to a point source. Risk assessment of various threats to the marine fish populations in the North Sea, such as overfishing, global warming, and eutrophication, should also take into account the ecologically relevant impact of offshore oil production. © 2011 Balk et al.",,"biological marker; fatty acid; liver enzyme; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; animal tissue; article; Atlantic cod; biotransformation; controlled study; enzyme activity; fish; genotoxicity; lipid composition; Melanogrammus aeglefinus; nonhuman; offshore oil industry; oxidative stress; pollution monitoring; population distribution; risk assessment; water pollution; Gadus morhua; Melanogrammus; Melanogrammus aeglefinus",,,,,,"Neff, J.M., Bioaccumulation in marine organisms: effect of contaminants from oil well produced water (2002), Amsterdam, ElsevierAnonymous, Oil in the Sea III - inputs, fates and effects (2003), Washington DC, National Academy PressHylland, K., Beyer, J., Berntssen, M., Klungsøyr, J., Lang, T., May persistent organic pollutants affect fish populations in the North Sea?
