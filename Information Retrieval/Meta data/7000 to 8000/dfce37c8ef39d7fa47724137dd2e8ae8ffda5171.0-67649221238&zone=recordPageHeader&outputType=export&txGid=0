Climate change models suggest increasing frequency and severity of warming-induced coral bleaching events, with consequent increases in coral mortality and algal overgrowth. Critically, the recovery of damaged reefs will depend on the reversibility of seaweed blooms, generally considered to depend on grazing of the seaweed, and replenishment of corals by larvae that successfully recruit to damaged reefs. These processes usually take years to decades to bring a reef back to coral dominance. Methodology/Principal Findings: In 2006, mass bleaching of corals on inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef caused high coral mortality. Here we show that this coral mortality was followed by an unprecedented bloom of a single species of unpalatable seaweed (Lobophora variegata), colonizing dead coral skeletons, but that corals on these reefs recovered dramatically, in less than a year. Unexpectedly, this rapid reversal did not involve reestablishment of corals by recruitment of coral larvae, as often assumed, but depended on several ecological mechanisms previously underestimated. Conclusions/Significance: These mechanisms of ecological recovery included rapid regeneration rates of remnant coral tissue, very high competitive ability of the corals allowing them to out-compete the seaweed, a natural seasonal decline in the particular species of dominant seaweed, and an effective marine protected area system. Our study provides a key example of the doom and boom of a highly resilient reef, and new insights into the variability and mechanisms of reef resilience under rapid climate change. © 2009 Diaz-Pulido et al.",,"alga; animal; Anthozoa; article; climate; growth, development and aging; Algae; Animals; Anthozoa; Climate",,,,,,"Hughes, T.P., Baird, A.H., Bellwood, D.R., Card, M., Connolly, S.R., Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs (2003) Science, 301, pp. 929-933; Bruno, J.F., Selig, E.R., Regional decline of coral cover in the Indo-Pacific: Timing, extent, and subregional comparisons (2007) PLoS ONE, 28, pp. e711. , doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000711; Bellwood, D.R., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Nystrom, M., Confronting the coral reef crisis (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 827-833; Pandolfi, J.M., Jackson, J.B.C., Baron, N., Bradbury, R.H., Guzmán, H.M., Are U.S. coral reefs on the slippery slope to slime?
