Bayesian analysis has the advantage of basing inference and decisions on a coherent and normatively appealing theoretical framework. Furthermore, it can incorporate diverse sources of information, including subjective opinions, historical observations and model outputs. The paper summarizes the basic assumptions and procedures of Bayesian analysis. Summaries of applications to detection of climate change, estimation of climate model parameters, and wetlands management under climatic uncertainty illustrate the potential of the Bayesian methodology. Criticisms of the approach are summarized. It is concluded that in comparison with alternative paradigms for analysing uncertainty, such as fuzzy sets and Dempster-Shafer reasoning, Bayesian analysis is practical, theoretically sound, and relatively easy to understand.","Bayesian analysis; Climate change; Decision-making; Global warming; Great Lakes; Risk analysis; Water resources; Wetlands","water; article; bayes theorem; climate; greenhouse effect; model; resource management; risk; Bayesian method; climate change; risk analysis; water resources; wetland management",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Berger, J.O., (1985) Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Bernier, J., Bayesian analysis of robustness of models in water and environmental sciences (1991) NATO ASI Series, G29, pp. 203-229. , Water Resources Engineering Risk Assessment (J.
