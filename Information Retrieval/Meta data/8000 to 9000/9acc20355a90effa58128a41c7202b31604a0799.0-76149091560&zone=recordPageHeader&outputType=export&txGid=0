Previously reported changes in the lake area have been updated by multi-temporal ASTER images, which revealed a decreased expansion rate after 2000. A provisional expansion of the lake observed in 2004, from which some studies concluded an accelerated lake expansion due to global warming, has, from 2005, subsided to the glacier surface. Bathymetric changes for the period 1992-2002 that were first obtained for Himalayan glacial lakes suggest that the melting of debris-covered ice beneath the lake is insignificant in terms of the increase in lake volume, and that the retreat of a glacier in contact with the lake by calving is essential for the lake's expansion. Changes in the height of a damming moraine for the period 2001-2007 suggest a continuous surface lowering near the lake, though the lowering rates are smaller than those for the period 1989-1994. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.","ASTER; Glacial lake; Himalaya","Bathymetry; Expansion; Global warming; ASTER; ASTER image; Continuous surface; Expansion rate; Glacial lakes; Himalayan glacial lake; Himalayas; Multi-temporal; Lakes",,,,,,"Bajracharya, B., Shrestha, A.B., Rajbhandari, L., Glacial Lake outburst floods in the Sagarmatha region: Hazard assessment using GIS and hydrodynamic modeling (2007) Mt.
