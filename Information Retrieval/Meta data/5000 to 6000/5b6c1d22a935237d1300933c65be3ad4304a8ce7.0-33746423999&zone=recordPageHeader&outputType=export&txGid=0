Some models predict that, in the short term, these areas will experience more epidemics as a result of global warming. However, the various processes underlying these changes are poorly understood. We therefore investigated malaria prevalence, malaria vector densities and malaria vector survival in a highland area in western Kenya, ranging from approximately 1550-1650 m altitude. Although only five adult malaria vectors were collected during 180 light traps and 180 resting collections over a 23-month study period, malaria was prevalent among school children (average parasite prevalence: 10%). During an extensive survey of potential larval habitats, we identified only seven habitats containing Anopheles gambiae Giles s.l. larvae. Their limited number and low larval densities suggested that their contribution to the adult vector population was small. Experiments on adult and larval survival showed that at this altitude, adult mosquitoes survived inside local houses, but that larval development was severely retarded: only 2 of 500 A. gambiae s.l. larvae developed to the pupal stage, whereas all other larvae died prior to pupation. At present, high vector densities are unlikely because of unfavourable abiotic conditions in the area. However, temporary favourable conditions, such as during El Niño years, may increase larval vector survival and may lead to malaria epidemics. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Anopheles arabiensis; Anopheles gambiae; Highlands; Kenya; Larvae; Malaria","fansidar; disease prevalence; disease vector; larval development; malaria; mosquito; survival; upland region; Anopheles gambiae; article; controlled study; female; health survey; human; Kenya; larval development; larval stage; major clinical study; malaria; nonhuman; parasite vector; population research; preschool child; prevalence; school child; species habitat; survival; Altitude; Animals; Anopheles; Anopheles gambiae; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Environment; Health Surveys; Humans; Insect Vectors; Kenya; Larva; Malaria, Falciparum; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Rural Health; Temperature; Africa; East Africa; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa; Anopheles gambiae",,"fansidar, 37338-39-9","fansidar",,,"Akhwale, W.S., Lum, J.K., Kaneko, A., Anemia and malaria at different altitudes in the western highlands of Kenya (2004) Acta Tropica, 91, pp. 167-175; Ameneshewa, B., Service, M.W., The relationship between female body size and survival rate of the malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis in Ethiopia (1996) Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 10, pp. 170-172; Beier, J.C., Perkins, P.V., Wirtz, R.A., Field evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite detection in anopheline mosquitoes from Kenya (1987) The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 36, pp. 459-468; Beier, J.C., Asiago, C.M., Onyango, F.K., Koros, J.K., ELISA absorbance cut-off method affects malaria sporozoite rate determination in wild Afrotropical Anopheles (1988) Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 2, pp. 259-264; Bødker, R., Akida, J., Shayo, D., Relationship between altitude and intensity of malaria transmission in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania (2003) Journal of Medical Entomology, 40, pp. 706-717; Brooker, S., Clarke, S., Njagi, J.K., Spatial clustering of malaria and associated risk factors during an epidemic in a highland area of western Kenya (2004) Tropical Medicine and International Health, 9, pp. 757-766; Burkot, T.R., Williams, J.L., Schneider, I., Identification of Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes by a double antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (1984) The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 33, pp. 783-788; Charlwood, J.D., Vij, R., Billingsley, P.F., Dry season refugia of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in a dry savannah zone of east Africa (2000) The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 62, pp. 726-732; Clements, A.N., Paterson, G.D., The analysis of mortality and survival rates in wild populations of mosquitoes (1981) Journal of Applied Ecology, 18, pp. 373-399; Collins, F.H., Mendez, M.A., Rasmussen, M.O., A ribosomal RNA gene probe differentiates member species of the Anopheles gambiae complex (1987) The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 37, pp. 37-41; Cox, D.R., Regression models and life tables (1972) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, 34, pp. 187-220; Day, K.P., Marsh, K., Naturally acquired immunity to Plasmodium falciparum (1991) Immunology Today, 12, pp. A68-A71; Etchegorry, M.G., Matthys, F., Galinski, M., White, N.J., Nosten, F., Malaria epidemic in Burundi (2001) The Lancet, 357, pp. 1046-1047; Garnham, P.C.C., The incidence of malaria at high altitudes (1948) Journal of the National Malaria Society, 7, pp. 275-284; Gillies, M.T., Studies on the dispersion and survival of Anopheles gambiae Giles in East Africa, by means of marking and release experiments (1961) Bulletin of Entomological Research, 52, pp. 99-127; Gillies, M.T., Coetzee, M., (1987) A Supplement to the Anophelinae of Africa South of the Sahara, , Publications of the South African Institute for Medical Research No. 55, Johannesburg; Gillies, M.T., Wilkes, T.J., A study of the age-composition of populations of Anopheles gambiae Giles and A. funestus Giles in North-Eastern Tanzania (1965) Bulletin of Entomological Research, 56, pp. 237-262; Hay, S.I., Cox, J., Rogers, D.J., Climate change and the resurgence of malaria in the East African highlands (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 905-909; Hay, S.I., Rogers, D.J., Randolph, S.E., Hot topic or hot air?
