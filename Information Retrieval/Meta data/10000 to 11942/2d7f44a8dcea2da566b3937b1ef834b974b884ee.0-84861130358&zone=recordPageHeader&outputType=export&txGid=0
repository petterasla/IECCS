The study was carried out at the Faculty of Education, in Giresun University during 2008-2009 Spring term. 154 senior prospective teachers from different departments participated in the study. As the data collection tool, nine open-ended questions and Global Warming Attitude Scale (GWAS) which was made up of 37 items and developed by Bozdogan were used. The data obtained from open-ended questions were analyzed descriptively and in terms of content. The data obtained from GWAS were analyzed by using ANOVA. With the help of the data, it was concluded that the prospective teachers' knowledge about global warming showed parallelism with their taking courses about this subject. Besides, it was revealed that the prospective teachers preferred techniques which brought visual elements in the foreground for the arrangement of activities about global warming. In addition to these, it was found that gender, club or group membership, taking courses about global warming and following developments about global warming did not have a significant effect on the attitudes of prospective teachers from different departments. © Sila Science.","Global warming; Prospective teachers' knowledge-attitude-teaching methods",,,,,,,"Aksay, C.S., Ketenoǧlu, O., Kurt, L., Global warming and climate change (2005) Selcuk Univ Fac Sci Lett Sci J, 25, pp. 29-41. , (In Turkish); Oztas, F., Kalipci, E., Bozkurt, E., How do biology teacher candidates perceive global climatic change?
