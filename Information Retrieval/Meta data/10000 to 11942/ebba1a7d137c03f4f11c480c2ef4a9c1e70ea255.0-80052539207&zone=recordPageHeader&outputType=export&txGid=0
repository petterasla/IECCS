Soil derived N 2O emissions usually display a high degree of spatial and temporal variability because of their dependence on soil chemical and physical properties, and climate dependent environmental factors. However, there is little research that incorporates spatial dependence in the estimation of N 2O emissions allowing for environmental factors in the same model. This study aims to examine the impact of two environmental factors (soil temperature and soil moisture) on N 2O emissions and explore the spatial structure of N 2O in the sub-tropical South East Queensland region of Australia. The replicated data on N 2O emissions and soil properties were collected at a typical sugarcane land site covering 25 uniform grid points across 3600m 2 between October 2007 and September 2008. A Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) model was used to model spatial dependence. Results showed that soil moisture and soil temperature appeared to have substantially different effects on N 2O emissions after taking spatial dependence into account in the four seasons. There was a substantial variation in the spatial distribution of N 2O emission in the different seasons. The high N 2O emission regions were accompanied by high uncertainty and changed in varying seasons in this study site. Spatial CAR models might be more plausible to elucidate and account for the uncertainty arising from unclear variables and spatial variability in the assessment of N 2O emissions in soils, and more accurately identify relationships with key environmental factors and help to reduce the uncertainty of the soil parameters. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian model; N 2O emissions; Soil; Spatial conditional autoregressive","Australia; Bayesian model; Car models; Conditional autoregressive; Different effects; Environmental factors; Global warming potential; Little research; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Queensland; Replicated data; Soil parameters; Soil property; Soil temperature; Spatial and temporal variability; Spatial dependence; Spatial structure; Spatial variability; Spatio-temporal variation; Study sites; Substantial variations; Uniform grids; Anesthetics; Bayesian networks; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Model automobiles; Moisture determination; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Temperature; Geologic models; nitrous oxide; Bayesian analysis; environmental factor; nitrous oxide; soil emission; soil moisture; soil property; soil temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; sugar cane; article; controlled study; environmental factor; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; soil moisture; soil pollution; soil temperature; sugarcane; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Biological; Nitrous Oxide; Queensland; Saccharum; Seasons; Soil; Australia; Queensland",,"nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Air Pollutants; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Soil",,,,"Allen, D.E., Kingstonc, G., Rennenbergd, H., Dalalb, R.C., Schmidta, S., Effect of nitrogen fertilizer management and waterlogging on nitrous oxide emission from subtropical sugarcane soils (2010) Agriculture, Ecosystems Environ, 136, pp. 209-217; Australian Greenhouse Office National greenhouse gas inventory 1999 with methodology supplements (2001), Australian Greenhouse Office, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra, 2001Ball, B.C., Horgan, G.W., Clayton, H., Parker, J.P., Spatial variability of nitrous oxide fluxes and controlling soil and topographic properties (1997) J Environ Qual, 26, pp. 1399-1409; Besag, J., Spatial interaction and the statistical analysis of lattice systems (1974) J R Stat Soc, 36, pp. 192-236; Besag, J., York, J., Mollie, A., Bayesian image restoration, with two applications in spatial statistics (1991) Ann I Stat Math, 43, pp. 1-59; Bouwman, A.F., Direct emission of nitrous oxide from agriculture soils (1996) Nutr Cycl Agroecosys, 46, pp. 53-70; Chen, D.L., Li, Y., Grace, P., Mosier, A.R., N 2O emissions from agricultural lands: a synthesis of simulation approaches (2008) Plant Soil, 309, pp. 169-189; Choudhary, M.A., Akramkhanov, A., Saggar, S., Nitrous oxide emissions from a New Zealand cropped soil: tillage effects, spatial and seasonal variability (2002) Agr Ecosyst Environ, 93, pp. 33-43; Cressie, N., (1993) Statistics for spatial data, , Wiley, New York; Dalal, R., Wang, W., Robertson, G., Parton, W., Nitrous oxide emission from Australian agricultural lands and mitigation options: a review (2003) Aust J Soil Res, 41, pp. 165-195; Denmead, O.T., Macdonald, B.C.T., Bryant, G., Naylor, T., Wilson, S., Griffith, D.W.T., Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide from Australian sugarcane soils (2010) Agric Forest Meteorology, 150, pp. 748-756; Ding, W.X., Cai, Y., Cai, Z.C., Kazuyuki, Zheng, X.H., Nitrous oxide emissions from an intensively cultivated maize-wheat rotation soil in the North China Plain (2007) Sci Total Environ, 373, pp. 501-511; Fortin, M.J., Dale, M., (2005) Spatial analysis a guide for ecologists, , Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK; Gelman, A., Inference and monitoring convergence (1996) Markov chain in practice, pp. 131-143. , Chapman&Hall/CRC, UK, W.
