Components of water consumption in a farmland, i.e. transpiration from the crop surface and evaporation from the soil surface, are influenced by the structure of crop canopy. In this study, the combined effects of elevated temperature and carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration on the geometry and longevity of leaves of maize were examined through an experiment with growth chambers. Three treatments, i.e. TLCL (air temperature day/night: 28/22°C, CO 2 concentration: 350ppm), TLCH (28/22°C, 750ppm), and THCH (32/26°C, 750 ppm), were performed in different closed chamber respectively, and sixteen of maize (Zea mays L. cv. Pioneer G-98) planted in a pot were grown in each treatment. The cumulative thermal time from emergence of plant until the expansion of the ith leaf became larger in the order, TLCH&lt;TLCL&lt; THCH. The longevity of the ith leaf became longer in the order, TLCL&lt;TLCH&lt;THCH. Area of the ith leaf in THCH was clearly smaller than that in TLCL and TLCH.",,"Zea mays",,,,,,"Assuero, S.G., Mollier, A., Pellerin, S., The decrease in growth of phosphorous-deficient maize leaves related to a lower cell production (2004) Plant, Cell and Environ., 27, pp. 887-895; Borrás, L., Westgate, M.E., Otegui, M.E., Control of kernel weight and kernel water relations by post-flowering source-sink ratio in maize (2003) Ann.
