The 'solar hypothesis' (as we shall term this assumption) claims that solar activity causes a significant component of the global mean temperature to vary in phase opposite to the filtered solar cycle lengths. In an earlier article we have demonstrated that for data covering the period 1860-1980 the solar hypothesis does not rule out any significant contribution from man-made greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols. The present analysis goes a step further. We analyse the period 1579-1987 and find that the solar hypothesis-instead of contradicting-appears to support the assumption of a significant warming due to human activities. We have tentatively 'corrected' the historical northern hemisphere land air temperature anomalies by removing the assumed effects of human activities. These are represented by northern hemisphere land air temperature anomalies calculated as the contributions from man-made greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols by using an upwelling diffusion-energy balance model similar to the model of Wigley and Raper (1993) employed in the Second Assessment Report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It turns out that the agreement of the filtered solar cycle lengths with the 'corrected' temperature anomalies is substantially better than with the historical anomalies, with the mean square deviation reduced by 36% for a climate sensitivity of 2.5°C, the central value of the IPCC assessment, and by 43% for the best-fit value of 1.7°C. Therefore our findings support a total reversal of the common assumption that a verification of the solar hypothesis would challenge the IPCC assessment of man-made global warming.","Global warming; Greenhouse gases; IPCC; Solar activity; Solar cycle lengths; Sunspot numbers; Upwelling diffusion-energy balance model","correlation; global warming; greenhouse gas; solar activity; solar cycle; sunspot",,,,,,"Briffa, K.R., Jones, P.D., Schweingruber, F.H., Osborn, T.J., Influence of volcanic eruptions on northern hemisphere summer temperature over the past 600 years (1998) Nature, 393, pp. 450-455; Cubasch, U., Voss, R., Hegerl, G.C., Waszkewitz, J., Crowley, T.J., Simulation of the influence of solar radiation variations on the climate with an ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (1997) Climate Dynamics, 13, pp. 757-767; Groveman, B.S., Landsberg, H.E., Simulated northern hemisphere temperature departures 1579-1880 (1979) Geophysical Research Letters, 6 (10), pp. 767-769; Groveman, B.S., Landsberg, H.E., (1979) Reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere Temperature: 1579-1880, , Publication No. 79-181.University of Maryland; Groveman, B.S., Landsberg, H.E., (1979) Data Appendices to Publication No. 79-181, , Publication No. 79-182.
