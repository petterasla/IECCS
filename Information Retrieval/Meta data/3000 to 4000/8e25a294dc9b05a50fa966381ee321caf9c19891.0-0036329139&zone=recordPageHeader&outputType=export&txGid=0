The sensitivity of moisture conditions across the conterminous US to increases in temperature also are examined. Results indicate that there have been statistically significant trends in PMPE, annual surplus, and annual deficit for some parts of the conterminous US. Most of the significant trends in PMPE have been increasing trends primarily in the eastern US. Annual surplus also has increased over the eastern US, whereas the magnitudes of annual deficit have decreased. For the conterminous US as a whole, there has been a statistically significant increase in PMPE and annual surplus; however, there is no significant trend in annual deficit. Results also indicate that PMPE and annual deficit in the warmest regions of the conterminous US are most sensitive to increase in temperature. The high sensitivity of PMPE and annual deficit in these regions to increases in temperature is related to the relation between temperature and the saturation vapor pressure of air. The increases in potential evapotranspiration for a given change in temperature are larger for high temperatures than for low temperatures. The regions with the highest sensitivity of annual surplus to increases in temperature are the humid regions of the country. In these regions, annual surplus is large and increased potential evapotranspiration, resulting from increased temperature, has a significant effect on reducing annual surplus. In the dry regions of the country, annual surplus is so low that increases in potential evapotranspiration only result in small decreases in annual surplus.","Climate change; Global warming; Moisture index","air temperature; atmospheric moisture; climate change; evapotranspiration; precipitation assessment; trend analysis; United States",,,,,,"Albrecht, B.A., Aerosols, cloud microphysics, and functional cloudiness (1989) Science, 245, pp. 1227-1230; Ayers, M.A., Wolock, D.M., McCabe, G.J., Hay, L.E., Tasker, G.D., Sensitivity of water resources in the Delaware River basin (1994) US Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 2422, , US Geological Survey, Reston, VA; Budyko, M.I., (1955) Atlas of the Heat Balance, , Gridometeoizdat, Leningrad; Budyko, M.I., (1974) Climate and Life, , Academic Press, San Diego, CA; Feddema, J.J., Mather, J.R., Hydrological impacts of global warming over the United States (1992) Global Climate Change: Implications, Challenges and Mitigation Measures, pp. 50-62. , Majumdar SK, Kalkstein LS, Yarnal B, Miller EW, Rosenfeld LM (eds) The Pennsylvania Academy of Science, Easton, PA; Gebert, W.A., Graczyk, D.J., Krug, W.R., Average annual runoff in the United States, 1951-1980 (1987) Hydrol Invest Atlas HA-710, , US Geological Survey, Reston, VA; Gleick, P.H., Regional hydrologic consequences of increases in atmospheric CO2 and other trace gases (1987) Clim Change, 10, pp. 137-161; Gleick, P.H., Climate change, hydrology, and water resources (1989) Rev Geophys, 27, pp. 329-344; Gleick, P.H., (2000) Water: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change.
