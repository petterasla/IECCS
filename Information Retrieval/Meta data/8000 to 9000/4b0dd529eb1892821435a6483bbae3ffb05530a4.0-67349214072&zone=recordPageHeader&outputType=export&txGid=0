This study relates the seed bank densities of species of Taxodium distichum swamps to local water regime and regional climate factors at five latitudes across the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley from southern Illinois to Louisiana. In an outdoor nursery setting, the seed banks of twenty-five swamps were exposed to non-flooded (freely drained) or flooded treatments, and the number and species of seeds germinating were recorded from each swamp during one growing season. Based on ANOVA analysis, the majority of dominant species had a higher rate of germination in non-flooded versus flooded treatments. Similarly, an NMS comparison, which considered the local water regime and regional climate of the swamps, found that the species of seeds germinating, almost completely shifted under non-flooded versus flooded treatments. For example, in wetter northern swamps, seeds of Taxodium distichum germinated in non-flooded conditions, but did not germinate from the same seed banks in flooded conditions. In wetter southern swamps, seeds of Eleocharis cellulosa germinated in flooded conditions, but did not germinate in non-flooded conditions. The strong relationship of seed germination and density relationships with local water regime and regional climate variables suggests that the forecasting of climate change effects on swamps and other wetlands needs to consider a variety of interrelated variables to make adequate projections of the regeneration responses of species to climate change. Because regeneration is an important aspect of species maintenance and restoration, climate drying could influence the species distribution of these swamps in the future. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Baldcypress; Climate drying; Distribution; Global warming; Latitude; Precipitation; Range compression; Seed bank; Seed dispersal; Temperature","coniferous tree; dominance; germination; global warming; growing season; latitude; population distribution; range size; regeneration; regional climate; seed bank; seed dispersal; swamp; temperature effect; Illinois; Louisiana; Mississippi River; North America; United States; Eleocharis; Eleocharis cellulosa; Taxodium; Taxodium distichum",,,,,,"Abernathy, V.M., Willby, N.J., Changes along a disturbance gradient in the density and composition of propagule banks in floodplain aquatic habitats (1999) Plant Ecol, 140, pp. 177-190. , 10.1023/A:1009779411686; Andalo, C., Beaulieu, J., Bosquet, J., The impact of climate change on growth of local white spruce populations in Quebec, Canada (2005) For Ecol Manage, 205, pp. 169-182. , 10.1016/j.foreco.2004.10.045; Andersson, E., Nilsson, C., Temporal variation in the drift of plant litter and propagules in a small boreal river (2002) Freshw Biol, 47, pp. 1674-1684. , 10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00925.x; Barrat-Segretain, M.H., Strategies of reproduction, dispersion, and competition in river plants: A review (1996) Vegetatio, 123, pp. 13-37. , 10.1007/BF00044885; Baskin, C.C., Baskin, J.M., (1998) Seeds, Ecology, Biogeography, and Evolution of Dormancy and Germination, , Academic Press San Diego; Boedeltje, G., Bakker, J.P., Ten Brinke, A., Van Groenendael, J.M., Soesbergen, M., Dispersal phenology of hydrochorous plants in relation to discharge, seed release time and buoyancy of seeds: The flood pulse concept supported (2004) J Ecol, 92, pp. 786-796. , 10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00906.x; Bradley, N.L., Leopold, A.C., Ross, J., Huffaker, W., Phenological changes reflect climate change in Wisconsin (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 9701-9704. , 10.1073/pnas.96.17.9701; Breshears, D.D., Cobb, N.S., Rich, P.M., Price, K.P., Allen, C.D., Balice, R.G., Romme, W.H., Meyer, C.W., Regional vegetation die-off in response to global-change-type drought (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 15144-15148; Cellot, B., Muillot, F., Henry, C.P., Flood drift and propagule bank of aquatic macrophytes in a riverine wetland (1998) J Veg Sci, 9, pp. 631-640. , 10.2307/3237281; Crumpacker, D.W., Box, E.O., Hardin, E.D., Implications of climatic warming for conservation of native trees and shrubs in Florida (2001) Conserv Biol, 15, pp. 1523-1739. , 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.0150041008.x; Cummins, R.P., Miller, G.R., Altitudinal gradients in seed dynamics of Calluna vulgaris in eastern Scotland (2002) J Veg Sci, 13, pp. 859-866. , 10.1658/1100-9233(2002)013[0859:AGISDO]2.0.CO;2; Easterling, D.R., Meehl, G.A., Parmesan, C., Changnon, S.A., Karl, T.R., Mearns, L.O., Climate extremes: Observations, modeling, and impacts (2000) Science, 289, pp. 2068-2074; Fabbro, T., Körner, C., Altitudinal differences in flower traits and reproductive allocation (2004) Flora, 199, pp. 70-81; Funes, G., Basconcelo, S., Diaz, S., Cabido, M., Seed bank dynamics in tall-tussock grasslands along an altitudinal gradient (2003) J Veg Sci, 14, pp. 253-258. , 10.1658/1100-9233(2003)014[0253:SBDITG]2.0.CO;2; Garcia, D., Zamora, R., Gomez, J.M., Jordano, P., Hodar, J.A., Geographical variation in seed production, predation and abortion in Juniperus communis throughout its range in Europe (2000) J Ecol, 88, pp. 436-446. , 10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00459.x; Gesch, R.W., Barbour, N.W., Forcella, R., Voorhees, W.B., Janick, J., Whipkey, A., Cuphea growth and development: Responses to temperature (2002) Trends in New Crops and New Uses, , ASHS Press Alexandria; Gleason, H.A., The individualistic concept of the plant association (1926) Bull Torrey Bot Club, 53, pp. 7-26. , 10.2307/2479933; Gunther, P.P., Casagrande, D.J., Cherney, R.R., Andrejko, J.J., Best, G.R., The viability and fate of seeds as a function of depth in the peat of Okenfenokee Swamp (1984) The Okefenokee Swamp: Its Natural History, Geology, and Geochemistry, , Wetland Surveys Los Alamos; Gutiérrez, J.R., Meserve, P.L., El Niño effects on soil seed bank dynamics in north-central Chile (2003) Oecologia, 134, pp. 511-517; Harper, J.L., (1977) The Population Biology of Plants, , Academic Press New York; Hengeveld, H., (2000) Projections for Canada's Climate Future.
