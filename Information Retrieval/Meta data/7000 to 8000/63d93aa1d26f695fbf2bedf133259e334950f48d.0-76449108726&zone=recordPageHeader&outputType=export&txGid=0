Against a background of climate change and accelerated human activities, changes in natural rainfall regimes have taken place and will be expected to become more pronounced in future decades. Long-term shifts may challenge the existing cultivation systems worldwide and eventually alter the spatiotemporal patterns of land use and topography. Meanwhile, specific features of soil crusting/sealing, plant litter and its decomposition, and antecedent soil moisture content (ASMC) will accompany rainfall variability. All these changes will increase pressures on soil erosion and hydrological processes, making accurate erosion prediction and control more difficult. An improved knowledge and understanding of this issue, therefore, is essential for dealing with the forthcoming challenges regarding soil and water conservation practices. In this paper, the characteristics of changes in natural rainfall, its role on terrestrial ecosystems, the challenges, and its effect on surface water erosion dynamics are elaborated and discussed. The major priorities for future research are also highlighted, and it is hoped that this will promote a better understanding of water erosion processes and related hydrological issues. © The Author(s), 2009.","Climate change; Process; Rainfall; Terrestrial ecosystem; Water erosion","climate change; human activity; land use change; literature review; long-term change; moisture content; rainfall; sealing; soil conservation; soil crusting; soil erosion; terrestrial ecosystem; water erosion",,,,,,"Bates, J.D., Svejcar, T., Miller, R.F., Angell, R.A., The effects of precipitation timing on sagebrush steppe vegetation (2006) Journal of Arid Environments, 64, pp. 670-697; Berg, B., McLaugherty, C., (2003) Plant Litter: Decomposition, Humus Formation, Carbon Sequestration, , Berlin: Springer; Berhe, A.A., Harte, J., Harden, J.W., Torn, M., The significance of the erosion-induced terrestrial carbon sink (2007) Bioscience, 57, pp. 337-346; Boer, M., Puigdefábregas, J., Effects of spatially structured vegetation patterns on hill-slope erosion in a semiarid Mediterranean environment: A simulation study (2005) Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 30, pp. 149-167; Bridges, E.M., Oldeman, L.R., Global assessment of human-induced land degradation (1999) Arid Soil Research and Rehabilitation, 13, pp. 319-325; Brierley, G., Stankoviansky, M., Editorial: Geomorphic responses to land use change (2003) Catena, 51, pp. 173-179; Busnelli, J., Neder L. del, V., Sayago, J.M., Temporal dynamics of soil erosion and rainfall erosivity as geoindicators of land degradation in northwestern Argentina (2006) Quaternary International, 158, pp. 147-161; Cantón, Y., Domingo, F., Solé-Benet, A., Puigdefábregas, J., Hydrological and erosion response of a badlands system in semiarid SE Spain (2001) Journal of Hydrology, 252, pp. 65-84; Chen, L.D., Lü, Y.H., Fu, B.J., Wei, W., A framework on landscape pattern analysis and scale change by using pattern recognition approach (2006) Acta Ecologica Sinica, 26, pp. 663-670. , (in Chinese with English abstract); Chen, L.D., Wei, W., Fu, B.J., Lü, Y.H., Soil and water conservation on the loess plateau in China: Review and prospective (2007) Progress In Physical Geography, 31, pp. 389-403; Cheng, J.D., Lin, L.L., Lu, H.S., Influences of forests on water flows from headwater watersheds in Taiwan (2002) Forest Ecology and Management, 165, pp. 11-28; Diodato, N., Modeling net erosion responses to enviroclimatic changes recorded upon multisecular timescales (2006) Geomorphology, 80, pp. 164-177; Eagleson, P.S., Ecological optimality in waterlimited natural soil-vegetation systems, 1.
