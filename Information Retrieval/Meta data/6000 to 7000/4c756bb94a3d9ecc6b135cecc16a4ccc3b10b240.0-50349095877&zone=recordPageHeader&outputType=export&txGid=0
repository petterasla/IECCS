Releases of the gas commonly described as ""Fugitive Gas Emissions"" are an important source of methane emissions. A possible approach to reduce the harmful effects of such methane emissions is to introduce the fugitive methane into a device that can convert it through combustion to less environmentally harmful products. It has been shown that the bulk of such methane can be converted into much weaker green house gases in an IDI diesel engine. However, such applications can bring about changes to engine combustion processes and the resulting performance. The present contribution reports the results of an investigation of the effect on combustion characteristics, emissions and performance of introducing very small concentrations of methane into the intake of an operating diesel engine. It is shown that for wide ranges of gas admission concentrations in the air, unlike with other conventional combustion devices such as burners and furnaces, much of the methane added was indeed oxidized in the IDI diesel engine and increased the power output and thus saving some diesel fuel. Such methane admissions tended to increase carbon monoxide emissions, indicating that part of the methane may not have been fully oxidized. NOx emission increased slightly, but when compared to the diesel operation for the same fuel energy input, it represented a reduction. Consuming a small amount of fugitive methane in the engine could bring about reductions to the global warming effect well in excess of that due to the entire engine exhaust gases resulting from diesel fuel combustion. The introduction of low concentrations of methane into the engine air hardly affected the ignition delay and the combustion duration. However, the total gross heat released and its rate showed correspondingly an increase consistent with a positive contribution of methane to engine power.","Combustion; Dual fuel; Fugitive gas emissions; Global warming potential (GWP); Methane","Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Biogas; Bioinformatics; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Computer networks; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Diesel locomotives; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Engines; Exhaust gases; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Ignition; Leakage (fluid); Machine design; Methane; Reduction; Smoke; Thermochemistry; Dual fuel; Fugitive gas emissions; Global warming potential (GWP); Methane emissions; Gas hydrates; biogas; carbon monoxide; combustion; conference proceeding; diesel engine; fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane",,,,,,"Shrestha, S.O., Bade Karim, G.A., The operational mixture limits in engines fueled with alternative gaseous fuels (2006) Journal of Energy Resources Energy, 128, pp. 223-228; Dodge, P., Gas turbines used to reduce pollution (1996) IGTI Global Gas Turbine News, 36 (2), pp. 10-12; Griffin, R.D., (1994) Principle of Air Quality Management, , Lewis Publishers, Albany; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York; Karim, G.A., Combustion in gas fuelled compression: Ignition engines of the dual fuel type (2003) Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, 125, pp. 827-836; Karim, G.A., Wierzba, I., Experimental and Analytical Studies of the Lean Operational Limits in Methane Fuelled Spark Ignition and Compression Ignition Engines Karim, G.A., Khan, M.O., Examination of Some of the Errors Normally Associated With the Calculation of Apparent Rates of Combustion Heat Release in Engines Parker, T.M., Fugitive methane emissions reduction using gas turbines.
