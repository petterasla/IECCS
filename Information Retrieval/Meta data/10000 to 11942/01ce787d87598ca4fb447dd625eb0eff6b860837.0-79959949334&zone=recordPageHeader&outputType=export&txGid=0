Therefore, we performed a three-year field warming experiment with free air temperature increase (FATI) facility to investigate the actual response of midseason rice growth in East China. There were four treatments (AW: all-day warming; DW: daytime warming; NW: nighttime warming; CK: ambient control) with three replicates. This FATI facility presented a good simulation of the local air temperature pattern with an increase in the daily mean temperature of about 1.1-2.0. °C during rice whole growth duration compared to the ambient control. Warming shortened the pre-heading phase respectively by 3.3. d, 1.7. d and 2.0. d in the AW, DW and NW plots, while the post-heading phase stayed almost unchanged. During the three years, warming slightly decreased the aboveground biomass by an average of 9.1%, 10.3% and 3.3%, and the grain yield by an average of 0.9%, 6.4% and 6.1% in the AW, DW and NW plots, respectively. Warming tended to decrease rice photosynthesis rate and stimulate the nighttime respiration rate. It also enlarged the flag leaf area and increased its chlorophyll content. No significant difference and interaction in the actual response of rice growth were found between the warming regimes. The above evidences suggest that the expected warming less than 2.0. °C may not cause significant decrease in rice productivity in East China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass production; East China; Free air temperature increase; Global warming; Grain yield; Midseason rice","agricultural modeling; air temperature; ambient air; chlorophyll; crop production; crop yield; global warming; historical record; leaf area; phytomass; respiration; rice; yield response; China",,,,,,"Arnon, D.I., Copper enzymes in isolated chloroplasts.
