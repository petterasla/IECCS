In Japan, these problems had already been given top-level consideration since 1989 and this led to the foundation of the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) in Kansai Science City: it was formally opened last year. This article, by its Director-General, reviews its policy and the research programmes already under way. © 1994 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01609327,,ENDEA,,"English","Endeavour",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149208162
