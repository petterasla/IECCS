The trends of the temperature anomalies over the continents and oceans were found to be opposite. The present global warming is concluded to be caused by the large-scale redistribution of heat in climatic system, indicating a compensative character of the variations observed. The dynamics of the longitudinal and latitudinal gradients of the surface temperature anomalies were analyzed. It was found that the dynamics of these gradients and the changes in the climate phases on the scales of the Northern Hemisphere are correlated. The present state of the climatic system is discussed, and it is concluded that a change in the climatic scenario in the nearest future is possible. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2006.",,"climate change; global warming; Northern Hemisphere; surface temperature; temperature anomaly",,,,,,"Aleinik, D.L., Byshev, V.I., Neiman, V.G., ""On the Origin of the Low-Frequency Variability in the Structure of the North Atlantic Waters"" (2003) Dokl.
