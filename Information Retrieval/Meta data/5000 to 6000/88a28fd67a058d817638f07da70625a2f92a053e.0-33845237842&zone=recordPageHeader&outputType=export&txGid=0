The emphasis is on the analysis of trends of the change in ACA characteristics in winter, when the long-term global warming is most considerable. The global climate models are shown to be able to describe not only the intermediate regimes of ACAs but also their dynamics. In particular, ECHAM4/OPYC3 is capable of reproducing the statistically significant connection of the characteristics of the North Pacific centers of action with El Niño/La Niña events, revealed from observational data. With the use of the results of the global climate models, the possible changes in the characteristics of centers of action in the 21st century are estimated for an increased content of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2006.",,"atmospheric modeling; climate change; general circulation model; global change; Northern Hemisphere; sensitivity analysis; twenty first century",,,,,,"Rossby, C.G., ""Relation between Variations in the Intensity of the Zonal Circulation of the Atmosphere and the Displacements of the Semi-Permanent Centers of Action"" (1939) J.
