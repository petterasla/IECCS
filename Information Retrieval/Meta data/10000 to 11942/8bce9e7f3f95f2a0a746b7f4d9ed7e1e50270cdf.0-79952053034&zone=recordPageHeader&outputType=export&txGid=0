El Niño events are associated with elevated water temperatures at large spatial (1000s of km) and temporal (annual) scales, providing environmental conditions that enable temperature effects on reef fishes to be tested directly. We compared remote sensing data of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, surface current flow and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration with monthly patterns in larval supply of coral reef fishes in nearshore waters around Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia) from January 1996 to March 2000. This time included an intense El Niño (April 1997-May 1998) event between two periods of La Niña (January-March 1996 and August 1998-March 2000) conditions. There was a strong relationship between the timing of the El Niño event, current flow, ocean productivity (as measured by Chl-a) and larval supply. In the warm conditions of the event, there was an increase in the SST anomaly index up to 3.5°C above mean values and a decrease in the strength of the westward surface current toward the reef. These conditions coincided with low concentrations of Chl-a (mean: 0.06mgm-3, SE ± 0.004) and a 51% decline in larval supply from mean values. Conversely, during strong La Niña conditions when SST anomalies were almost 2°C below mean values and there was a strong westward surface current, Chl-a concentration was 150% greater than mean values and larval supply was 249% greater. A lag in larval supply suggested that productivity maybe affecting both the production of larvae by adults and larval survival. Our results suggest that warming temperatures in the world's oceans will have negative effects on the reproduction of reef fishes and survival of their larvae within the plankton, ultimately impacting on the replenishment of benthic populations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Chlorophyll-a; Climate; Coral reefs; Current; El Niño; ENSO; Fish larvae; La Niña; Larval supply; Settlement; SST","chlorophyll a; coral reef; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental conditions; global warming; La Nina; sea surface temperature; spatial analysis; water temperature; Rangiroa; Tuamotu Archipelago; Anthozoa; Pisces",,,,,,"Barnett, T.P., Pierce, D.W., AchutaRao, K.M., Gleckler, P.J., Santer, B.D., Gregory, J.M., Washington, W.M., Penetration of human-induced warming into the world's oceans (2005) Science, 309, pp. 284-287; Bergenius, M.A.J., McCormick, M.I., Meekan, M.G., Robertson, D.R., Environmental influences on larval duration, growth and magnitude of settlement of a coral reef fish (2005) Marine Biology, 147, pp. 291-300; Bergenius, M.A.J., Meekan, M.G., Robertson, D.R., McCormick, M.I., Larval growth predicts the recruitment success of a coral reef fish (2002) Oecologia, 131, pp. 521-525; Bonjean, F., Lagerloef, G.S.E., Diagnostic model and analysis of the surface currents in the tropical Pacific ocean (2002) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 32, pp. 2938-2954; Brander, K.M., Global fish production and climate change (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 104, pp. 19709-19714; Brodeur, R.D., Peterson, W.T., Auth, T.D., Soulen, H.L., Parnel, M.M., Emerson, A.A., Abundance and diversity of coastal fish larvae as indicators of recent changes in ocean and climate conditions in the Oregon upwelling zone (2008) Marine Ecology-Progress Series, 366, pp. 187-202; Brunel, T., Boucher, J., Long-term trends in fish recruitment in the north-east Atlantic related to climate change (2007) Fisheries Oceanography, 16, pp. 336-349; Cane, M.A., The evolution of El Niño, past and future (2005) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 230, pp. 227-240; Cheal, A.J., Delean, S., Sweatman, H., Thompson, A.A., Spatial synchrony in coral reef fish populations and the influence of climate (2007) Ecology, 88, pp. 158-169; Cheung, W.W.L., Lam, V.W.Y., Sarmiento, J., Kearney, K., Watson, R., Zeller, D., Pauly, D., Large-scale redistribution of maximum fisheries catch potential in the global ocean under climate change (2010) Global Change Biology, 16, pp. 24-25; Doherty, P.J., Dufour, V., Galzin, R., Hixon, M.A., Meekan, M.G., Planes, S., High mortality during settlement is a population bottleneck for a tropical surgeonfish (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 2422-2428; Donelson, J.M., Munday, P.L., McCormick, M.I., Pankhurst, N.W., Pankhurst, P.M., Effects of elevated water temperature and food availability on the reproductive performance of a coral reef fish (2010) Marine Ecology-Progress Series, 325, pp. 195-203; Dufour, V., Galzin, R., Colonization patterns of reef fish larvae to the lagoon at Moorea Island, French Polynesia (1993) Marine Ecology-Progress Series, 102, pp. 143-152; Friedland, K.D., Hare, J.A., Wood, G., Does the fall phytoplankton bloom control recruitment of Georges Bank haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, through parental condition?
