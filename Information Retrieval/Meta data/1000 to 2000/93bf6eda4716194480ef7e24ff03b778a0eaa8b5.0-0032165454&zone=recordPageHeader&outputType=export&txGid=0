However, the emergence of that technology takes time. In this review, the possibilities and limits of this technology are analysed. The performances are shown to be very interesting and in progress, and right now applications are foreseen. The use of waste heat for solid sorption air-conditioning may be an attractive application, but, for a large dissemination, higher efficiencies as well as cost reduction are required. With respect to primary energy and global warming, sorption cooling and heat pumping is coherent, except for waste heat or solar applications, only if the cooling COP is larger than about 1 or 1.2 depending on operating conditions. Technical results are close to that point which provide a wider perspective. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.
