There are already a number of investigations on mitigation strategies, but most of them focus on one gas only and neglect the fact, that conditions reducing the emission of one trace gas might have a directly opposed effect on another. We conducted several field experiments to investigate the influence of application technique and pre-treatment of slurry on trace gas emissions after slurry application. Ammonia, CH4 and N2O where measured simultaneously. It could be clearly shown, that some of the tested slurry management techniques had contrary effects on the emissions of the different trace gases. With information on emissions of single trace gases, wrong conclusions might be drawn concerning the effectiveness of mitigation options. By comparing the emissions based on CO2 equivalents, the different management options can be compared comprising all three studied trace gases.","Application technique; Global warming potential; Slurry treatment",,,,,,,"Bussnik, D.W., Huijsmans, J.F.M., Ketelaars, J.J.M.H., Ammonia volatilization from nitric-acid treated cattle slurry surface applied to grassland (1994) Neth.
