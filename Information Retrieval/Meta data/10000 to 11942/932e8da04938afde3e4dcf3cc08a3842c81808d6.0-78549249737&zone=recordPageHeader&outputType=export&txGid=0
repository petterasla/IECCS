It can be chosen as the main source of power generation in some countries or complement the energy matrix in others. In this context, there is the need to develop new technologies for the management of radioactive waste generated by the production process. Final repositories for spent fuel are not yet in commercial operation, and techniques for fuel reprocessing have been developed, because after use, the fuel still has materials that produce energy. Some countries already use reprocessing, and develop research to make it more secure and more competitive, while others prefer to adopt policies to prevent developments in this area due to the problem of nuclear proliferation. In another line of research, new reactors are being developed in order to reduce the amount of waste in energy production and some will be designed to work in closed loop, recycling the materials generated. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Nuclear energy; Reprocessing; Spent fuel","Closed loops; Commercial operation; Energy matrix; Energy productions; Energy source; New technologies; Nuclear proliferation; Production process; Reprocessing; Energy conversion; Fuels; Global warming; Industrial waste treatment; Nuclear energy; Production engineering; Radioactive wastes; Research; Waste management; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; nuclear power; power generation; processing; radioactive waste; repository; research and development",,,,,,"Chandler, S.J., (2006), Comparison of reprocessing methods for light water reactor fuel.
