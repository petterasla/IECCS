Concepts from natural gas storage are readily adapted to CO2 sequestration in coal. Coal-seam fill-up with CO2 can be described by coupling a gas-injectivity equation with a mass-balance equation. The full-length paper presents example calculations for two selected coal basins.",,"Carbon dioxide; Coal; Gas emissions; Global warming; Natural gas fields; Natural gas well production; Underground gas storage; Coal sequestration; Gas injectivity; Natural gas storage; Petroleum reservoir engineering",,,,,,,,,,"Soc Pet Eng (SPE), Richardson, TX, United States",,,,,01492136,,JPTJA,,"English","JPT J Pet Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-18744427317
