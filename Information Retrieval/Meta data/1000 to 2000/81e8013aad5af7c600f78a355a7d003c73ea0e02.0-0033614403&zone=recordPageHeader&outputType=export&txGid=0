It is commonly thought that the climate response to anthropogenic forcing should be distinct from the patterns of natural climate variability. But, on the basis of studies of nonlinear chaotic models with preferred states or 'regimes', it has been argued that the spatial patterns of the response to anthropogenic forcing may in fact project principally onto modes of natural climate variability. Here we use atmospheric circulation data from the Northern Hemisphere to show that recent climate change can be interpreted in terms of changes in the frequency of occurrence of natural atmospheric circulation regimes. We conclude that recent Northern Hemisphere warming may be more directly related to the thermal structure of these circulation regimes than to any anthropogenic forcing pattern itself. Conversely, the fact that observed climate change projects onto natural patterns cannot be used as evidence of no anthropogenic effect on climate. These results may help explain possible differences between trends in surface temperature and satellite-based temperature in the free atmosphere.",,"atmospheric circulation; climate change; frequency dependence; Northern Hemisphere; thermal structure; analytic method; article; atmospheric diffusion; climate; forecasting; greenhouse effect; meteorology; model; oscillation; priority journal; temperature",,,,,,"Houghton, J.T., (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Cambridge Univ.
