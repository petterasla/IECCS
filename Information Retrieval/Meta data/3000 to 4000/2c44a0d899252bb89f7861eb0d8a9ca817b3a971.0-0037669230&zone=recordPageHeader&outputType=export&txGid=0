All storms and a subclass of intense storms are analyzed separately. Statistics Canada agriculture census data are used to correct storm frequencies for the absence of reports from unoccupied land, for sampling network drift, and for changes in farm numbers and sizes. These corrections eliminate an apparent tornado spatial frequency maximum in central Alberta and reveal a minor temporal frequency maximum from 1906 to 1940 followed by no apparent trend in time for all intense storms. The frequencies of reports of severe winters in rural community histories of Alberta and Saskatchewan are compared with mean winter temperatures at Edmonton and with a severe winter index derived from temperature and snowfall data. All temperature data were corrected for urban heat island warming by an adaptation of Oke's proposed logarithmic relation between heat island intensity and urban population. The index identifies in correct order of importance the three most frequently mentioned severe winters of 1907, 1920 and 1936. Ten-year averages of mean winter temperatures and the severe winter index from 1882 to 2001 seem to show wavelike time changes rather than a long-term trend.","Alberta; Saskatchewan; Severe winters; Time trends; Tornadoes; Windstorms","climate change; global warming; severe weather; storm; tornado; Canada",,,,,,"Caracena, F., Holle, R., Doswell, C., (1989) Microbursts: A Handbook for Visual Identification, , National Severe Storms Laboratory, Norman, Oklahoma, 35 pp; Chaikowsky, C., (2000) Analysis of Alberta Temperature Observations and Estimates of Global Climate Models, , T/562, Environmental Sciences Division, Alberta Environment, Edmonton, Alberta, 45 pp; Clements, M., Storm clouds over Regina (1953) Saskatchewan History, 1, pp. 17-23; Cooley, J., Cold air funnel clouds (1978) Monthly Weather Review, 106, pp. 1368-1372; Currie, B., (1954) Wind and Storms: Prairie Provinces and Northwest Territories, , Department of Physics, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, 41 pp; Doswell, C., Moller, A., Brooks, H., Storm spotting and public awareness since the first tornado forecasts of 1948 (1999) Weather Forecasting, 14, pp. 544-557; Forbes, G., Bluestein, H., Tornadoes, tornadic thunderstorms and photogrammetry: A review of the contributions of T.T.
