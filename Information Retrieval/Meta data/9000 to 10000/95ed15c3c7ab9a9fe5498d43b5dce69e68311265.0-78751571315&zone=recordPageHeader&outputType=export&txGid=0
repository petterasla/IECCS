The model had atmospheric forcing from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data. Three basic gross primary production (GPP) domains were distinguished: (i) an extensive domain dominated by Atlantic Water, (ii) an elongated domain roughly corresponding to the seasonal ice zone (SIZ) and (iii) a compact perennial ice zone (&gt;100, between 100 and 30 and &lt;30 g C m-2 year-1, respectively). The interannual coefficient of variation for GPP in domain (i) was &lt;0.1, and increased northwards towards &gt;0.6 in the northwesternmost and northeasternmost fringe of the SIZ. The primary production in the northern sector of the European Arctic Corridor (EAC) region prior to 2007 was characterised by limited interannual variability, on average 75.2 ± 10% and 24.0 ± 16% g C m-2 year-1 for the EAC region at 74-80 and &gt;80°N, respectively. The main primary production anomalies were found early in the productive season and in sections of the SIZ, generally in regions with low GPP. There was no significant trend of increasing GPP in the 1995-2007 time interval. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Decadal anomalies; European Arctic Ocean; Global warming; Interannual decadal variability; Primary production; Seasonal ice zone","annual variation; atmospheric forcing; climate variation; decadal variation; global warming; net primary production; polar region; seasonal variation; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Fram Strait; Greenland Sea; Kara Sea; Norwegian Sea; Southern Ocean",,,,,,"Loeng, H., Marine systems (2005) Arctic climate impact assessment, pp. 453-538. , ACIA,Symon, C, Arris, L, Heal, B, Cambridge University Press, New York; Arrigo, K.R., van Dijken, G., Pabi, S., Impact of shrinking Arctic ice cover on marine primary production (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35, pp. L19603; Comiso, J.C., Parkinson, C.L., Gersten, R., Stock, L., Accelerated decline in the Arctic sea ice cover (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35, pp. L01703; Dankers, R., Middelkoop, H., River discharge and freshwater runoff to the Barents Sea under present and future climate conditions (2008) Clim Change, 87, pp. 131-153; Ellingsen, I.H., Dalpadado, P., Slagstad, D., Loeng, H., Impact of climatic change on the biological production in the Barents Sea (2008) Clim Change, 87, pp. 155-175; Ellingsen, I., Slagstad, D., Sundfjord, A., Modification of water masses in the Barents Sea and its coupling to ice dynamics: a model study (2009) Ocean Dyn, , doi: 10. 1007/s10236-009-0230-5; Giles, K.A., Laxon, S.W., Ridout, A.L., Circumpolar thinning of Arctic sea ice following the 2007 record ice extent minimum (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35, pp. L22502; Gosselin, M., Levasseur, M., Wheeler, P.A., Horner, R.A., Booth, B.C., New measurements of phytoplankton and ice algal production in the Arctic Ocean (1997) Deep Sea Res, 44, pp. 1623-1644; Hegseth, E.N., Primary production of the northern Barents Sea (1998) Polar Res, 17, pp. 113-123; Hirche, H.-J., Kosobokova, K.N., Harms, I., Meon, B., Nöthig, E.-M., The pelagic systems of the Kara Sea-communities and components of the carbon flow (2006) Prog Oceanogr, 7, pp. 291-316; Holfort, J., Hansen, E., Time series of Polar Water properties in Fram Strait (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, pp. L19601; Hop, H., Falk-Petersen, S., Svendsen, H., Kwasniewski, S., Pavlov, V., Pavlova, O., Søreide, J.E., Physical and biological characteristics of the pelagic system across Fram Strait to Kongsfjorden (2006) Prog Oceanogr, 71, pp. 182-231; Kuznetsov, L.L., Schoschina, E.V., (2003) Phytocenoses of the Barents Sea (physiological and structural characteristics), p. 308. , Kola Scientific Centre RAS, Apatity,(in Russian); McMinn, A., Hegseth, E.N., Sea ice primary productivity in the northern Barents Sea, spring 2004 (2006) Polar Biol, 30, pp. 289-294; McPhee, M.G., Proshutinsky, A., Morison, L.H., Steele, M., Alkire, M.B., Rapid change in freshwater content of the Arctic Ocean (2009) Geophys Res Lett, 36, pp. L10602; Nghiem, S.V.Y., Rigor, I.G., Perovich, D.K., Clement-Colon, P., Weatherly, J.W., Neumann, G., Rapid reduction of Arctic perannual sea ice (2007) Geophys Res Lett, 34, pp. L19504. , doi:10.1029/2007GL031138; Pabi, S., van Dijken, G.L., Arrigo, K.R., Primary production in the Arctic Ocean, 1998-2006 (2008) J Geophys Res, 113. , doi: 10. 1029/2007jc004578; Ratkova, T.N., Wassmann, P., Sea-ice algae in the White Sea and Barents Sea: composition and origin (2005) Polar Res, 24, pp. 95-110; Rodrigues, J., The rapid decline of the sea ice in the Russian Arctic (2008) Cold Reg Sci Technol, 54, pp. 124-142; Rothrock, D.A., Percival, D.B., Wensnahan, M., The decline in arctic sea ice thickness: separating the spatial, and interannual variability in a quarter century of submarine data (2008) J Geophys Res, 113, pp. C05003. , doi:10.1029/2007JC004252; Sakshaug, E., Primary and secondary production in the Arctic Seas (2004) The Organic Carbon Cycle in the Arctic Ocean, pp. 57-81. , R.
