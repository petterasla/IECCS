Currently, the only feasible source for significant expansion of the greenhouse-gas neutral (GGN) energy generation in the state is wind power. A criterion for GGN of a desalination plant has been formulated. In a case of no greenhouse gas contribution from the desalination plant, the criterion is satisfied if the annual growth of the electrical energy generated by GGN sources is around 6-9% for the period 2010-2070. Higher annual growth of 18% for the period 2008-2015, 8% annually for the period 2015-2035 and 6% annual growth thereafter are required if the desalination plant is contributing to the greenhouse-gas balance of the state. © 2009 The Authors.
