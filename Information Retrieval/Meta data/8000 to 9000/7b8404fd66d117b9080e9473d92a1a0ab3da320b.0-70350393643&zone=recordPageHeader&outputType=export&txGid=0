In the context of managed flood control, these systematic changes are likely to disrupt the balance between flood control and reservoir refill in existing reservoir systems. To adapt to these hydrologic changes, refill timing and evacuation requirements for flood control need to be modified. This work poses a significant systems engineering problem, especially for large, multiobjective water systems. An existing optimization/simulation procedure is refined for rebalancing flood control and refill objectives for the Columbia River Basin for anticipated global warming. To calibrate the optimization model for the 20th century flow, the objective function is tuned to reproduce the current reliability of reservoir refill, while providing comparable levels of flood control to those produced by current flood control practices. After the optimization model is calibrated using the 20th century flow the same objective function is used to develop flood control curves for a global warming scenario which assumes an approximately 2°C increase in air temperature. Robust decreases in system storage deficits are simulated for the climate change scenario when optimized flood rule curves replace the current flood control curves, without increasing monthly flood risks. © 2009 ASCE.","Climate changes; Columbia River; Floods; Global warming; Hydrologic models; Optimization; Reservoir operation; Simulation","20th century; Air temperature; Climate change scenarios; Columbia River; Flood risks; Hydrologic changes; Hydrologic models; Multi objective; Objective functions; Optimization models; Pacific Northwest; Peak flows; Rebalancing; Reservoir operation; Reservoir systems; River basins; Simulation; Snowmelt; Spring snow; Systematic changes; Temperature changes; Water system; Climate control; Curve fitting; Flood control; Floods; Global warming; Hydraulic models; Mathematical models; Optimization; Reservoirs (water); Risk perception; Simulators; Snow; Systems engineering; Watersheds; River control; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; flood control; flooding; global warming; hydrological change; reservoir; snowmelt; Columbia Basin; North America",,,,,,"Christensen, N.S., Wood, A.W., Voisin, N., Lettenmaier, D.P., Palmer, R.N., ""The effects of climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the Colorado River Basin"" (2004) Clim.
