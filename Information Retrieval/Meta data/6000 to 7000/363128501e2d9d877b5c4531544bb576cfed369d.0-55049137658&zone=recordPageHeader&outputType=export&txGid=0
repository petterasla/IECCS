Increasing nitrogen (N) availability and its dynamics will likely impact plant responses to heat stress and carbon (C) sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. This field study examined the effects of N availability on plant response to heat-stress (HS) treatment in naturally-occurring vegetation. HS (5 d at ambient or 40.5 °C) and N treatments (±N) were applied to 16 1 m2 plots in restored prairie vegetation dominated by Andropogon gerardii (warm-season C4 grass) and Solidago canadensis (warm-season C3 forb). Before, during, and after HS, air, canopy, and soil temperature were monitored; net CO2 assimilation (Pn), quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦPSII), stomatal conductance (gs), and leaf water potential (Ψw) of the dominant species and soil respiration (Rsoil) of each plot were measured daily during HS. One week after HS, plots were harvested, and C% and N% were determined for rhizosphere and bulk soil, and above-ground tissue (green/senescent leaf, stem, and flower). Photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE) and N resorption rate (NRR) were calculated. HS decreased Pn, gs, Ψw, and PNUE for both species, and +N treatment generally increased these variables (±HS), but often slowed their post-HS recovery. Aboveground biomass tended to decrease with HS in both species (and for green leaf mass in S. canadensis), but decrease with +N for A. gerardii and increase with +N for S. canadensis. For A. gerardii, HS tended to decrease N% in green tissues with +N, whereas in S. canadensis, HS increased N% in green leaves. Added N decreased NRR for A. gerardii and HS increased NRR for S. canadensis. These results suggest that heat waves, though transient, could have significant effects on plants, communities, and ecosystem N cycling, and N can influence the effect of heat waves. © 2008 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Global climate change; Heat stress; N resorption rate; Photosynthesis; Photosynthetic N-use efficiency","nitrogen; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental stress; global warming; heat source; nitrogen; photosynthesis; prairie; resorption; rhizosphere; vegetation; Andropogon; article; biomass; drug effect; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; Solidago; temperature; Andropogon; Biomass; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Plants; Solidago; Temperature; Andropogon; Andropogon gerardii; Solidago; Solidago canadensis",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Aerts, R., Nitrogen partitioning between resorption and decomposition pathways: A trade-off between nitrogen use efficiency and litter decomposibility?
