The support of such claims is largely statistical, as knowledge of the physical relationships is limited. The statistical evidence is revisited. Changing solar activity is a statistically plausible hypothesis for the observed warming, if short-term natural variability is the only alternative explanation. Compared to the enhanced greenhouse effect, the solar hypothesis looses a substantial part of its plausibility. Reversely, the size and significance of the estimated impact of the enhanced greenhouse effect on the global mean temperature is hardly affected by solar activity.",,"climate change; greenhouse effect; solar activity; statistical analysis",,,,,,"Almon, S., The distributed lag between capital appropriations and expenditures (1962) Econometrica, 30, pp. 407-423; Eddy, J.A., Climate and the changing sun (1977) Climatic Change, 1, pp. 173-190; Friis-Christensen, E., Lassen, K., Length of the solar cycle: An indicator of solar activity closely associated with climate (1991) Science, 254, pp. 698-700; Hansen, J.E., Lacis, A.A., Sun and dust versus greenhouse gases: An assessment of their relative roles in global climate change (1990) Nature, 346, pp. 713-719; Kelly, P.M., Wigley, T.M.L., The influence of solar forcing trends on global mean temperature since 1861 (1990) Nature, 347, pp. 460-462; Kelly, P.M., Wigley, T.M.L., Solar cycle length, greenhouse forcing and global climate (1992) Nature, 360, pp. 328-330; Jones, P.D., Raper, S.C.B., Bradley, R.S., Diaz, H.F., Kelly, P.M., Wigley, T.M.L., Northern hemisphere surface air temperature variations: 1851-1984 (1986) J.
