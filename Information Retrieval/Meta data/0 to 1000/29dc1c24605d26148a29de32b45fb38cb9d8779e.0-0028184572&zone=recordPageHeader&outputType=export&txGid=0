Variable tropical SSTs may explain the interhemispheric synchroneity of global climate change as recorded in ice cores, snowline reconstructions, and vegetation records. Radiative changes due to cloud type and cloud cover are plausible mechanisms for maintaining cooler tropical SSTs in the past.",,"sea water; article; climate; history; nonhuman; priority journal; temperature; tropics; climate change; radiative change; temperature variation; tropical region; Barbados",,,,,,,"Guilderson, T.P.; Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Route 9-W, Palisades, NY 10964, United States",,,,,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","SCIENCE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028184572
