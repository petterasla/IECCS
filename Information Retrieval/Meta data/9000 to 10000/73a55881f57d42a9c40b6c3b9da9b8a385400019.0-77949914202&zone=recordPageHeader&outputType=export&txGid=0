The reason this is so alarming is because amphibians have been seen as a ""Canary in the mine"" when it comes to the world's environmental changes. With global warming and CO 2 emissions all over the news, we have become more aware of how we are impacting our world. If the decline of amphibians is a precursor to what is happening with the environment, then we need to find a good model to give us estimates on what is going to happen in the future. Here we used a predator-prey-competition model to help investigate how three amphibians might interact when confined to the same area. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
