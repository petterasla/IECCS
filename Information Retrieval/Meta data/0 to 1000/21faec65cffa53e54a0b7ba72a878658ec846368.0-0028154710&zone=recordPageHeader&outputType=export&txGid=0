The measurements taken monthly during the cultivation periods showed a significant difference in CH4emission rates among three sites. One paddy field, in Suphan Buri, showed a relatively high emission of CH4, with average fluxes of 19.5–32.2 mg m−2h−1. The average fluxes from the other two paddy fields, in Khlong Luang and Chai Nat, were 3.8 and 1.6 mg m−2h−1, respectively, being one order of magnitude lower than those from Suphan Buri. The low emission of CH4at the two sites was attributed to the high concentration of sulfate in soil or the high soil Eh due to the lower abundance of the reducing capacity in relation to the oxidizing capacity of soil. The results suggest that it is essential to provide a data base of soil characteristics, such as soil type and chemical composition of soil affecting the oxidation-reduction process, as well as conduct extensive field measurements in various rice growing countries to evaluate the global emission rates of CH4from rice paddy fields. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Acid sulfate soil; Global warming; Methane flux; Soil Eh; Tropics",,,,,,,"Asami, T., Kumada, K., A new method for determining free iron in paddy soils (1959) Soil Plant Food, 5, pp. 141-146; Bouwman, A.F., Soils and the Greenhouse Effect (1990) Global Biogeo- Chem.
