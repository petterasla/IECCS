Most of the area is rangelands with only 5% arable. Animal agriculture is centuries old occupation of the people of Balochistan. Livestock are one of the major important sectors of the province having about 20% of the national stock. However, with little manufacturing facilities and underdeveloped infrastructure, the provincial economy lags far behind other parts of the country. This is the cradle of many precious livestock breeds and livestock make an important part of the socio-cultural and socioeconomic survival of its inhabitants. The biodiversity of animal genetic resources plays very pivotal role in the economy of the province and each breed has its own uniqueness and socioeconomic importance. The exact value of such precious animal genetic resource has never been realized as yet and no serious steps have been taken for its improvement. It is the utmost need of the time to rethink on the policies relating to livestock production in the province while keeping the needs of the growing population, socio-cultural change and the global warming issues in mind. © 2010 PVJ.","Animal genetic resources; Balochistan; Global warming; Livestock species; Socioeconomic change","Animalia",,,,,,"Agricultural Census Organization, Government of Pakistan (2006) Livestock Census, , ACO Statistics Division, Gulberg-III, Lahore, Pakistan; (1987) Pakistan's experience in rangeland rehabilitation and improvement, , FAO FAO, Rome, Italy; (2002) Facts files, , FAO FAO, Rome, Italy; (1999) Balochistan District Database, , GOB Planning and Development Department, Government of Balochistan, Quetta, Pakistan; (1983) Developed from Livestock Census, , GOP & FAO Reports National Agricultural Research Center, Islamabad, Pakistan; Kakar, M.A., Raziq, A., Masood-ul-Haq, K., Faqir, M., Trends and potentials in dairy production of Balochistan province (2008) Pak J Agri Sci, 45 (2), pp. 259-262; Mahmood, K., Rodriguez, A., Marketing and processing of small ruminants in highlands of Balochistan (1991) Research Report, pp. 14-19. , International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas; Nagy, J.G., Sabir, G.F., Stubbs, J.M., Sheep and goat production in Balochistan (1991) Pakistan.
