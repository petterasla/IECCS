Since methane is a strong greenhouse gas, this could produce a potentially important positive feedback. Our base case clathrate distribution results in about 24 000 Gt C as methane clathrate in marine sediments and about 800 Gt C in terrestrial sediments, only a small fraction of which could be destabilized by future global warming. -from Authors",,"continental slope sediment; global warming; methane clathrate; permafrost",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028829893
