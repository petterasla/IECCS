Here, using historical records and palaeoclimatic reconstructions during AD 10-1900, we demonstrate that war frequency, price of rice, locust plague, drought frequency, flood frequency and temperature in China show two predominant periodic bands around 160 and 320 years where they interact significantly with each other. Temperature cooling shows direct positive association with the frequency of external aggression war to the Chinese dynasties mostly from the northern pastoral nomadic societies, and indirect positive association with the frequency of internal war within the Chinese dynasties through drought and locust plagues. The collapses of the agricultural dynasties of the Han, Tang, Song and Ming are more closely associated with low temperature. Our study suggests that food production during the last two millennia has been more unstable during cooler periods, resulting in more social conflicts owing to rebellions within the dynasties or/and southward aggressions from northern pastoral nomadic societies in ancient China. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Drought/flood; Global warming; Human ecology; Locust plague; Southward migration; War cycle","aggression; cooling; drought; flood; frequency analysis; historical geography; historical record; low temperature; natural disaster; nomadic people; paleoclimate; quantitative analysis; reconstruction; rice; social conflict; war; China; climate change; conference paper; disaster; history; population dynamics; war; China; Climate Change; Disasters; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Population Dynamics; War; China",,,,,,"Atwell, W.S., Time, money and the weather: Ming China and the great depression of the mid-fifteenth century (2002) J.
