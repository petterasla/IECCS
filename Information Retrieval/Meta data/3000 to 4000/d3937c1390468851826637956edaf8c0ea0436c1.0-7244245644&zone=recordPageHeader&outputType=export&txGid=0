The CO2 treatment was crossed with a two-level nitrogen (N) fertilization treatment. In the tenth year, soil samples were collected on three occasions through the growing season to assess the impact of eCO2 and N fertilization on mycorrhizal fungal abundance. Soil moisture content, which varied with harvest date, was linked to the vegetation type and was higher under eCO. Root weight density was affected by vegetation type: lower for clover, higher for grass. Root weight density was stimulated by eCO2 and decreased by high N fertilization. The percent root length colonized by mycorrhizal fungi was lowest in the clover plots and highest in the grass plots. High N significantly decreased root length colonized. There was no overall effect of eCO2 on root length colonized; however, there was a significant eCO2 × N interaction: eCO2 increased root length colonized at high N, but detreased root length colonized at low N. Extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal density was linked to soil moisture content. Extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal density was not affected by eCO2 or high N individually, but as for root length colonized, there was a significant eCO2 × N interaction: eCO2 increased extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal density at low N but not at high N. These environmental effects on root colonization and external mycorrhizal hyphae were independent of soil moisture content and root weight density. This field study demonstrated a significant mediating effect of N fertilization on the response of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to eCO 2 irrespective of any change in root biomass. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Arbuscular mycorrhizas; Global environmental change; Increased atmospheric CO2; Nitrogen Addition; Root length colonized","arbuscular mycorrhiza; carbon dioxide enrichment; fungus; nitrogen; nutrient enrichment; Central Europe; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland; World; Zurich [Switzerland]; Fungi; Lolium; Lolium perenne; Trifolium; Trifolium repens",,,,,,"Aerts, R., The role of various types of mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient cycling and plant competition (2002) Ecolgical Studies, 157, pp. 117-133; Augé, R.M., Water relations, drought and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (2001) Mycorrhiza, 11, pp. 3-42; Bradford, M.A., Jones, T.H., Bardgett, R.D., Impacts of soil faunal community composition on model grassland ecosystems (2002) Science, 298, pp. 615-618; Cao, M., Woodward, F.I., Dynamic responses of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling to global climate change (1998) Nature, 393, pp. 249-252; Coleman, D.C., Crossley, D.A., (1996) Fundamentals of Soil Ecology, , Academic Press, San Diego, CA; Corkidi, L., Rowland, D.L., Johnson, N.C., Nitrogen fertilization alters the functioning of arbuscular mycorrhizas at two semiarid grasslands (2002) Plant and Soil, 240, pp. 299-310; Daepp, M., Suter, D., Almeida, J.P.F., Yield response of Lolium perenne swards to free air CO2 enrichment over six years in a high N input system on fertile soil (2000) Global Change Biology, 6, pp. 805-816; Davidson, E.A., Trumbore, S.E., Amundson, R., Soil warming and organic carbon content (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 789-790; Derner, J.D., Johnson, H.B., Kimball, B.A., Above- and below-ground responses of C3-C4 species mixtures to elevated CO2 and soil water availability (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 452-460; Egerton-Warburton, L.M., Allen, E.B., Shifts in arbuscular mycorrhizal communities along an anthropogenic nitrogen deposition gradient (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 484-496; Fitter, A.H., Heinemeyer, A., Staddon, P.L., The impact of elevated CO2 and global climate change on arbuscular mycorrhizas: A mycocentric approach (2000) New Phytologist, 147, pp. 179-187; Gamper, H., Peter, M., Jansa, J., Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi benefit from 7 years of free air CO 2 enrichment in well-fertilized grass and legume monocultures (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 189-199; Gange, A., Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Collembola and plant growth (2000) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 15, pp. 369-372; Gavito, M.E., Bruhn, D., Jakobsen, I., Phosphorus uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae does not increase when the host plant grows under atmospheric CO2 enrichment (2002) New Phytologist, 154, pp. 751-760; Gavito, M.E., Curtis, P.S., Mikkelsen, T.N., Atmospheric CO2 and mycorrhiza effects on biomass allocation and nutrient uptake of nodulated pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants (2000) Journal of Experimental Botany, 51, pp. 1931-1938; Gavito, M.E., Schweiger, P., Jakobsen, I., P uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae: Effect of soil temperature and atmospheric CO2 enrichment (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 106-116; Godbold, D.L., Berntson, G.M., Bazzaz, F.A., Growth and mycorrhizal colonization of three North American tree species under elevated atmospheric CO2 (1997) New Phytologist, 137, pp. 433-440; Grime, J.P., Brown, V.K., Thompson, K., The response of two contrasting limestone grasslands to simulated climate change (2000) Science, 289, pp. 762-765; Helgason, T., Daniell, T.J., Husband, R., Ploughing up the wood-wide web?
