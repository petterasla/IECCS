In the system, alkanolamine-based chemical solvent was assumed to be used to remove and recover CO2 from the stack gas, and the extracted steam from the steam turbine at a temperature of 454 K to regenerate CO2-absorbed solvent. The equation to estimate the net power generation efficiency ηN was derived when its CO2 recovery rate RCO2 is changed, and a simulation model was developed to estimate various characteristics of the system. It has been estimated that ηN is 50-2% when RCO2 is 0% but the value of ^degrades sharply according to the rise of the value of CO2R, and ηN decreased to 37-1% when RCO2 is raised to 90%; that is, the efficiency of the system becomes lower than 37-7%, that of a CO2-recovering steam turbine generation system using the same chemical CO2 absorption solvent. © 1997 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; CO2 absorption; CO2 recovery; Combined cycle; Efficiency; Global warming",,,,,,,"Pak, P.S., Nakamura, K., Suzuki, Y., Closed dual fluid gas turbine power plant without emission of CO2 into the atmosphere (1989) Proceedings of IFAC/IFORS/IAEE International Symposium on Energy Systems, Management and Technology, pp. 249-254; Pak, P.S., Nakamura, K., Suzuki, Y., Coal-gas-burning high-efficiency power plant which recovers generated carbon dioxide (1991) Electrical Engineering in Japan, 111 (5), pp. 49-59; Pak, P.S., Nakamura, K., Suzuki, Y., CO2-recovering power generation system in a CO2-recycling global energy system cogeneration system (1993) Int.
