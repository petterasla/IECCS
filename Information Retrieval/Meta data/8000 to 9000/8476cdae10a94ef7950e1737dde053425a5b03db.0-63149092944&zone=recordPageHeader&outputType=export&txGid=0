As well, the effects of an increase in the urban temperature and VOC emissions on the concentration of photochemical oxidants were also considered. The following conclusions were drawn. The observed air pollution levels were well modeled by the atmospheric dispersion model using in this study, although modeled NO levels were slightly lower than the observed levels. An analysis of the temperature data showed that a 1 °C increase in temperature leads to a maximal photochemical oxidant concentration of 5.3 ppb, which is an increase of 11%. Additionally, the effect on the photochemical oxidant concentration due to an increase in the vegetation-derived VOCs was more than double the effect due to an increase in the photochemical reactions. It was found that the temperature and photochemical oxidant concentration were linearly related up to a temperature increase of 3 °C. When the temperature increases up to 3 °C, the concentration of photochemical oxidants increases by 19 ppb. An analysis of the effect of vegetation-derived VOCs on photochemical oxidant concentrations showed that, the concentration of photochemical oxidants was 30 ppb higher in the afternoon by the effect of vegetation-derived VOCs, so even in metropolitan areas with relatively little vegetation, vegetation-derived VOCs have a strong impact on photochemical oxidant concentrations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
