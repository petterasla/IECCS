However, some current policies governing forest carbon credits actually promote avoidable CO2 release and punish actions that would increase long-term carbon storage. In fire-prone forests, management that reduces the risk of catastrophic carbon release resulting from stand-replacing wildfire is considered to be a CO2 source, according to current accounting practices, even though such management may actually increase long-term carbon storage. Examining four of the largest wildfires in the US in 2002, we found that, for forest land that experienced catastrophic stand-replacing fire, prior thinning would have reduced CO2 release from live tree biomass by as much as 98%. Altering carbon accounting practices for forests that have historically experienced frequent, low-severity fire could provide an incentive for forest managers to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire and associated large carbon release events. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"carbon; catastrophic event; environmental policy; forest management; global warming; nutrient uptake; risk assessment; wildfire",,,,,,"Agee, J.K., (1993) Fire ecology of Pacific Northwest forests, , Washington, DC: Island Press; Agee, J.K., Skinner, C.N., Basic principles of forest fuel reduction treatments (2005) Forest Ecol Manag, 211, pp. 83-96; Auclair AND and Carter TB. 1993.
