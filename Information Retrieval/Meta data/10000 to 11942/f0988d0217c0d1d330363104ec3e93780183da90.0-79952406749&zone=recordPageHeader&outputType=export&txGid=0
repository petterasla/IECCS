In this paper, changes in glacial extent, glacial mass balance and seasonal snow cover are discussed. Glacial retreat was estimated for 1868 glaciers in 11 basins distributed in the Indian Himalaya since 1962. The investigation has shown an overall reduction in glacier area from 6332 to 5329 km2 from 1962 to 2001/2 - an overall deglaciation of 16%. Snow line at the end of ablation season on the Chhota Shigri glacier observed using field and satellite methods suggests a change in altitude from 4900 to 5200 m from the late 1970s to present. Seasonal snow cover was monitored in the 28 river sub-basins using normalized difference snow index (NDSI) technique in Central and Western Himalaya. The investigation has shown that in the early part of winter, i.e. from October to December, a large amount of snow retreat was observed. For many basins located in lower altitude and in the south of the Pir Panjal range, snow ablation was observed throughout the winter season. In addition, average stream runoff of the Baspa basin for the month of December increased by 75%. This combination of glacial retreat, negative mass balance, early melting of seasonal snow cover and winter-time increase in stream runoff might suggest an influence of global warming on the Himalayan cryosphere. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.",,"Cryosphere; Deglaciations; Glacial mass balance; Glacial retreat; Himalayan rivers; Himalayas; Mass balance; Normalized difference snow indices; Remote sensing techniques; Seasonal snow cover; Snow ablation; Snowline; Subbasins; Winter seasons; Ablation; Glacial geology; Glaciers; Global warming; Hydraulics; Remote sensing; Rivers; Runoff; Snow; cryosphere; deglaciation; glacier mass balance; glacier retreat; global warming; remote sensing; snow cover; Himalayas",,,,,,"Bagla, P., No sign yet of Himalayan meltdown, Indian report finds (2009) Science, 326, pp. 924-925; Bahuguna, I.M., Kulkarni, A.V., Shailesh Nayak, B.P., Rathore Negi, H.S., Mathur, P., Himalayan glacier retreat using IRS 1C PAN stereo data, (2007) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 28, pp. 437-442; Chaohai, L., Sharma, C.K., (1988) Report on First Expedition to Glaciers in the Pumqu (Arun) and Poiqu (Bhote-Sun Kosi) River Basins, Xizang (Tibet), China, , (Beijing, China: Science Press); Cracknell, A.P., Varotsos, C.A., The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the fifteenth anniversary of Sputnik (2007) Environment Science and Pollution Research, 14, pp. 384-387; Dhar, S., Kulkarni, A.V., Rathore, B.P., Kalia, R., Reconstruction of the moraine dammed lake, based on field evidences and paleohistory, Samudra Tapu Glacier, Chandra Basin, Himachal Pradesh (2010) Journal of Indian Society of Remote Sensing, 38, pp. 133-141; Hansen, J., Nazarenko, L., Ruedy, R., Sato, M., Willis, J., Genio, A.D., Koch, D., Tausnev, N., Earth's energy imbalance: Confirmation and implications (2005) Science, 308, pp. 1431-1435; (2007) The Physical Science Basis, Summary for Policymakers, pp. 1-18. , IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), (Geneva: IPCC Secretariat); (2007) The Physical Science Basis, Summary for Policymakers, pp. 1-18. , IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), (Geneva: IPCC Secretariat); Johannesson, T., Raymond, C.F., Waddington, E.D., Time-scale for adjustment of glaciers to changes in mass balance (1989) Journal of Glaciology, 35, pp. 355-369; (1999) Inventory of the Himalayan glaciers, , Kaul, M.K.
