Sub-aerial transport processes are represented, whereas sub-aqueous transport is neglected. The system is tightly coupled morphologically, with the berm playing a central role. For example, the potential for sand to be transported to the dune by wind depends on berm width, and sand lost in erosion of the dune during storms can widen the berm. Morphologic equilibrium considerations are introduced to improve reliability of predictions and stability of the non-linear model. An analytical solution is given under simplification to illustrate properties of the model. Sensitivity tests with the numerical solution of the coupled equations demonstrate model performance, with one test exploring beach and dune response to potential increase in storm-wave height with global warming. Finally, the numerical model is applied to examine the consequences of groin shortening at Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York, as an alternative for providing a sand supply to the down-drift beach. Results indicate that the sand will be released over several decades as the shoreline and dune move landward in adjustment to the new equilibrium condition with the shortened groins. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Beach response; Coastal structures; Dune erosion; Groins; Longshore sediment transport; Numerical modeling; Shoreline evolution; Windblown sand","Beach response; Coastal structures; Dune erosion; Longshore sediment transport; Numerical modeling; Beaches; Coastal engineering; Global warming; Mathematical models; Numerical analysis; Numerical methods; Sand; Sediment transport; Sedimentology; Soil mechanics; Storms; Underwater foundations; Wave equations; Jetties; berm; coastal evolution; coastal landform; coastal structure; dune; global warming; groin; longshore transport; numerical model; sediment transport; wave height; Long Island [New York]; New York [United States]; United States",,,,,,"Bagnold, R.A., (1954) The physics of blown sand and desert dunes, , Methuen & Co.
