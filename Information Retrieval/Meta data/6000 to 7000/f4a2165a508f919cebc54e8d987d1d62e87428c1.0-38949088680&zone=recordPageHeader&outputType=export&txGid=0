Three treatments were set in the studied field: (A) litter-free, (B) with litter, and (C) with litter and seedling. The results showed that the soil in our study was a sink of atmospheric CH4 and source of atmospheric N2O. The observed mean CH4 fluxes from treatments A, B, and C were -50.0 ± 4.0, -35.9 ± 2.8, -31.6 ± 2.8 μgC/(m2·h), respectively, and calculated annual fluxes in 2003 were -4.1, -3.1, and -2.9 kgC/hm2, respectively. The observed mean N2O fluxes from treatments A, B, and C were 30.9 ± 3.1, 28.2 ± 3.5, 50.2±3.7 μgN/(m2·h), respectively, and calculated annual fluxes in 2003 were -4.1, -3.1, and -2.9 kgC/hm2, respectively. The observed mean N2O fluxes from treatments A, B, and C were 30.9 ± 3.1, 28.2 ± 3.5, 50.2±3.7 μgN/(m2·h), respectively, and calculated annual fluxes in 2003 were 2.8, 2.6, and 3.7 kgN/hm 2, respectively. Seasonal variations in CH4 and N2O fluxes were significant among all the three treatments. The presence of litter decreased CH4 uptake during wet season (P &lt; 0.05), but not during dry season. There was a similar increase in seedlings-mediated N2O emissions during wet and dry seasons, indicating that seedlings increased N2O emission in both seasons. A strong positive relationship existed between CH4 fluxes and soil moisture for all the three treatments, and weak relationship between CH4 fluxes and soil temperature for treatment B and treatment C. The N2O fluxes correlated with soil temperature for all the three treatments. © 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","global warming; greenhouse gases; rain forest; seasonal variability; soil moisture; soil temperature","Gas chromatography; Global warming; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Soil pollution; Soil testing; Temperature distribution; Closed static chamber technique; Seasonal variability; Soil temperature; Greenhouse gases; Gas chromatography; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Soil pollution; Soil testing; Temperature distribution; gas chromatography; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrogen dioxide; seasonal variation; soil moisture; soil temperature; tropical forest; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan; methane; nitrous oxide; rain; water; air pollutant; article; biomass; China; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; season; seedling; soil pollutant; temperature; tree; tropic climate; Air Pollutants; Biomass; China; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Rain; Seasons; Seedling; Soil Pollutants; Temperature; Trees; Tropical Climate; Water",,"methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; water, 7732-18-5; Air Pollutants; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Soil Pollutants; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Born, M., Dörr, H., Levin, I., Methane consumption in aerated soils of the temperate zone (1990) Tellus, 42 B (1), pp. 2-8; Breuer, L., Papen, H., Butterbach-Bahl, K., N2O emission from tropical forest soils of Australia (2000) J Geophys Res, 105 (D21), pp. 26353-26367; Cao, M., Zhang, J., Feng, Z., Deng, J., Deng, X., Tree species composition of a seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China (1996) Tropical Ecology, 37 (2), pp. 183-192; Castro, M., Steudler, P., Melillo, J., Aber, J., Bowden, R., Factors controlling atmospheric methane consumption by temperate forest soils (1995) Global Biogeochemistry, 9 (1), pp. 1-10; Chang, C., Janzen, H., Cho, C., Nakonechny, E., Nitrous oxide emission through plants (1998) SoilSciSoc Am J, 62 (1), pp. 35-38; Chen, H., Harmon, M., Sexton, J., Fasth, B., Fine-root decomposition and N dynamics in coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest, USA (2002) Can J Forest Res, 32 (2), pp. 320-331; Crill, P., Seasonal patterns of methane uptake and carbon dioxide release by a temperate woodland soil (1991) Global Biogeochemistry, 5 (4), pp. 319-334; Delmas, R., Servant, J., Tathy, J., Cros, B., Labat, M., Sources and sinks of methane and carbon dioxide exchanges in mountain forest in equatorial Africa (1992) J Geophys Res, 97 (D6), pp. 6169-6179; Dobbie, K., McTaggart, I., Smith, K., Nitrous oxide emissions from intensive agricultural systems: variations between crops and seasons, key driving variables, and mean emission factors (1999) J Geophys Res, 104 (D21), pp. 26891-26899; Dong, Y., Scharffe, D., Lobert, J., Crutzen, P., Sanhueza, E., Fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from a temperate forest soil: the effects of leaves and humus layers (1998) Tellus, 50 B (3), pp. 243-252; Dörr, H., Katruff, L., Levin, I., Soil texture parameterization of the methane uptake in aerated soils (1993) Chemosphere, 26 (4), pp. 697-713; Garcia-Mndez, G., Maass, J., Matson, P., Vitousek, P., Nitrogen transformations and nitrous oxide flux in a tropical deciduous forest in Mexico (1991) Oecologia, 88 (3), pp. 362-366; Goreau, T., De Mello, W., Tropical deforestation: some effects on atmospheric chemistry (1987) Ambio, 17 (4), pp. 275-281; Hakata, M., Takahashi, M., Zumft, W., Sakamoto, A., Morikawa, H., Conversion of the nitrate nitrogen and nitrogen dioxide to nitrous oxides in plants (2003) Acta Biotechnol, 23 (2-3), pp. 249-257; IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), (2001) Climate Change 2001.
