We tested the detection of ice thickness using ground penetrating radar (GPR) in the Hongqipao reservoir. Ice crystals, gas bubbles, ice density and ice thickness were also determined by concurrently drilling for validation. During the tests the gas bubble content was high in the upper and low in the bottom, ice density varied with the bubble content, and the ice thickness was not homogeneous. By comparisons between radar detected and in-situ measured ice thicknesses with theoretical analyses of the influence of gas bubble content on the dielectric constant, a three-layer model with snow, granular ice, and columnar ice was established and the transmission speed of radar wave within the ice was determined. Experience reveals that the equivalent dielectric constant can be used to evaluate the wave speed and the values at 1/3 ice cover depth can be used as equivalent values. Besides, the difference between the theoretical transmission time and the real detection time induced by large gas bubbles increases nonlinearly with the theoretical transmission time or ice thickness. © 2010 Editorial Office of Applied Geophysics and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Detection; Error; Radar; Reservoir ice; Thickness",,,,,,,"Assel, R., Cronk, K., Norton, D., Recent trends in Laurentian Great Lakes ice cover (2003) Climatic Change, 57, pp. 185-204; Cooper, D.W., Mueller, R.A., Schertler, R.J., Remote profiling of lake ice using an S-band short-pulse radar aboard an all-terrain vehicle (1976) Radio Science, 11, pp. 375-381; Cui, X.B., Sun, B., Tian, G., Tang, X.Y., Zhang, X.P., Jiang, Y.Y., Guo, J.X., Li, X., Ice radar investigation at Dome A, East Antarctic: Ice thickness and subglacial topography (2010) Chinese Science Bulletin, 55 (4-5), pp. 425-431; Evans, S., The dielectric properties of ice and snow: A review (1965) Journal of Glaciology, 5, pp. 773-792; Galley, R.J., Trachtenberg, M., Langlois, A., Barber, D.G., Shafai, L., Observations of geophysical and dielectric properties and ground penetrating radar signatures for discrimination of snow, sea ice, and freshwater ice thickness (2009) Cold Regions Science and Technology, 57, pp. 29-38; Gherboudj, I., Bernier, M., Hicks, F., Leconte, R., Physical characterization of air inclusions in river ice (2007) Cold Regions Science and Technology, 49, pp. 179-194; Holt, B., Kanagaratnam, P., Gogineni, S.P., Ramasami, V.C., Mahoney, A., Lytle, V., Sea ice thickness measurements by ultrawideband penetrating radar: First results (2009) Cold Regions Science and Technology, 55, pp. 33-46; Li, Z., Guo, H.D., Shi, J.C., Retrieving dry snow density with SIR-C polarimetric SAR data (2001) Chinese Science Bulletin, 46 (1), pp. 1211-1214; Li, Z.J., Jia, Q., Huang, W.F., Li, C.Y., Characteristics of ice crystal air bubbles and densities of fresh ice in a reservoir (2009) Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 40 (11), pp. 1333-1338. , (in Chinese); Looyenga, H., Dielectric constant of heterogeneous mixtures (1965) Physica, 21, pp. 401-406; Šarauskiene, D., Jurgelenaite, A., Impact of climate change on river ice phenology in Lithuania (2008) Environmental Research, Engineering, and Management, 46 (4), pp. 13-22; Shokr, M.E., Field observations and model calculations of dielectric properties of Arctic sea ice in the microwave C-band (1998) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 36 (2), pp. 463-478; Sun, B., Martin, J.S., Simon, M.M., David, S., Shuji, F., Cui, X.B., Jiang, Y.Y., Li, Y.S., The Gamburtsev mountains and the origin and early evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 690-693; Wang, B.B., Tian, G., Sun, B., Guo, J.X., Zhang, X.P., An analysis of the multi-fold method for GPR exploration (2006) Applied Geophysics, 3 (3), pp. 187-191; Wang, B.B., Tian, G., Cui, X.B., Zhang, X.P., The internal COF features in Dome A of Antarctica revealed by multi-polarization-plane RES (2008) Applied Geophysics, 5 (3), pp. 230-237; Wang, N.L., Pu, J.C., Ice thickness sounded by ground penetrating radar on the Bayi Glacier in the Qilian Mountains, China (2009) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 31 (3), pp. 431-435. , (in Chinese); Welch, B.C., Jacobel, R.W., Arcone, S.A., First results from radar profiles collected along the US-ITASE traverse from Taylor Dome to South Pole (2006-2008) (2009) Annals of Glaciology, 50 (51), pp. 35-41","Li, Z.-J.; State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China; email: lizhijun@dlut.edu.cn",,,,,,,,16727975,,,,"English","Appl.
