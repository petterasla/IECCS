We analyzed historical records from 40 sites and found that 20 major streams and rivers have shown statistically significant, long-term warming. Annual mean water temperatures increased by 0.009-0.077°C yr -1, and rates of warming were most rapid in, but not confined to, urbanizing areas. Long-term increases in stream water temperatures were typically correlated with increases in air temperatures. If stream temperatures were to continue to increase at current rates, due to global warming and urbanization, this could have important effects on eutrophication, ecosystem processes such as biological productivity and stream metabolism, contaminant toxicity, and loss of aquatic biodiversity. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"air temperature; biodiversity; biological production; ecological impact; eutrophication; river water; streamwater; temperature profile; toxicity; urbanization; warming; water temperature; United States",,,,,,"Ashizawa, D., Cole, J.J., Long-term temperature trends for the Hudson River: A study of the historical data (1994) Estuaries, 17, pp. 166-71; Brazel, A., Selover, N., Vose, R., Heisler, G., The tale of two climates - Baltimore and Phoenix urban LTER sites (2000) Clim Res, 15, pp. 123-35; Burns, D.A., Klaus, J., McHale, M.R., Recent climate trends and implications for water resources in the Catskill Mountain region, New York, USA (2007) J Hydrol, 336, pp. 155-70; Burton, T.M., Likens, G.E., Effect of strip-cutting on stream temperatures in Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire (1973) BioScience, 23, pp. 433-35; Caissie, D., The thermal regime of rivers: A review (2006) Freshwater Biol, 51, pp. 1389-1406; Durance, I., Ormerod, S., Climate change effects on upland stream macroinvertebrates over a 25-year period (2007) Glob Change Biol, 13, pp. 942-57; Grimm, N.B., Faeth, S.H., Golubiewski, N.E., Global change and the ecology of cities (2008) Science, 319, pp. 756-60; (2007), IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)Climate change 2007.
