These changes should be taken into account when assessing future flooding risks. This study presents a method for quantifying the increase in flood risk caused by global climate change for use in urban flood risk management. Flood risk in this context is defined as the product of flood damage potential and the probability of its occurrence. The study uses a geographic information system-based flood damage prediction model to calculate the flood damage caused by design storms with different return periods. Estimation of the monetary damages these storms produce and their return periods are precursors to flood risk calculations. The design storms are developed from modified intensity-duration-frequency relationships generated by simulations of global climate change scenarios (e.g. CGCM2A2). The risk assessment method is applied to the Kanda River basin in Tokyo, Japan. The assessment provides insights not only into the flood risk cost increase due to global warming, and the impact that increase may have on flood control infrastructure planning. © IWA Publishing 2011.","Climate change; Flood inundation modelling; Flood risk assessment; Flood risk management","Damage Potential; Damage prediction models; Design storms; Flood inundation modelling; Flood risk assessment; Flood risk management; Flood risks; Geographic information; Global climate changes; Infrastructure planning; Rainfall patterns; Return periods; Risk assessment methods; River basins; System-based; Tokyo , Japan; Urban floods; Urban river; Flood control; Flood damage; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Mathematical models; Planning; Rain; Rating; Risk management; Risk perception; River control; Storms; Risk assessment; river water; storm water; climate change; climate prediction; flood control; flood damage; flooding; future prospect; GIS; global climate; infrastructure planning; precipitation intensity; probability; quantitative analysis; rainfall; risk assessment; river management; article; climate change; cost; flooding; geographic information system; global climate; greenhouse effect; Japan; prediction; risk assessment; river; urban area; water management; Climate Change; Costs and Cost Analysis; Disaster Planning; Floods; Geographic Information Systems; Models, Theoretical; Probability; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Urbanization; Honshu; Japan; Kanda Basin; Kanto; Tokyo [Kanto]",,,,,,"Chow, V.T., Maidment, D.R., Mays, L.W., (1988) Applied Hydrology, , MacGraw-Hill, International Edition, New York; Davis, D.W., Risk analysis in flood damage reduction studies - The Corps Experience (2002) Proceedings of Environmental & Water Resources Institute, EWRI, ASCE, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Climate Adaptation: Risk, Uncertainty and Decision-Making (2003) UKCIP Technical Report, , DEFRA (R.
