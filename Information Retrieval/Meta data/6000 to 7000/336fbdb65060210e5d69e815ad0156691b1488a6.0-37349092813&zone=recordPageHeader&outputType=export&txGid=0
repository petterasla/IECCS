To date, most of the studies aimed at assessing the effects of climate change on these phenological events in birds have been on hole-nesting species and the changes linked either to local climate variation or to some large-scale composite variables, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Relatively less is known about the climate responses of open-nesting birds and on the relative roles of climate variables at different scales. Using bird ringing records covering a time span of 41 years, we documented shifts in the timing of breeding and brood size in a long-distance migrant, the Red-Backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) from a central European population. We found a 3- to 4-day shift towards earlier breeding and an increase in brood size by approximately 0.3 nestlings since 1964. The Red-Backed Shrikes start to breed in May and rear the first nestlings in June. During the period 1964-2004, temperatures in May significantly increased, while the increase in June temperatures was not significant. Simultaneous tests on the influence of local climate variables and the NAO index revealed a better performance of local climate. The increasing temperature in May was positively associated with the advancement of breeding. Similarly, at a local scale, higher May temperatures were followed by larger brood sizes, while a high amount of rainfall had a strong negative effect. © Dt.
