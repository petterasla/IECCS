The increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases causes a great problem in the atmosphere. However, CO2 gas constituted the biggest threat at present, though the other gases increase, too. One of the primary precautions to take for this is the context of soil earth atmospheric CO2 through plants. Beside the context of soil carbon, some other factors are also affecting this context. Some of them are texture, bulk density (BD), cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations (EC), soil reaction (pH) and electrical conductivity (Ec). In Harran plain, an organic carbon amount ranged from 0.28 to 4.95 kg C m-2. The statistic analyses data in the factors are: BD, organic carbon (OC), texture (clay, silt and sand%), CEC, EC, pH and Ec. The strongest correlation was found as BD and OC (R2 = 99.96), but when compared with the other factors, it was detected as R2 = 99.4. The reason for its height when we consider all the parameters is the involvement of organic carbon in the calculation. When we deal with them individually, the correlation falls below 50%. In this study, a point of high correlation is made between OC and BD. The study aims to determine, in the soils, BD, which is costly, hard and time consuming, and OC which is known by means of this correlation. In the comparison analysis of the entire data and the determination of the equations, student t test was used and the data were investigated at p&lt;0.01 significance levels. However, ANOVA techniques were used regularly in this comparison.
