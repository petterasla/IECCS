In the late boreal summer, hemispherical averages of the tropical precipitation anomalies from the multimodel ensemble show a strong positive trend in the Northern Hemisphere and a weak negative trend in the Southern Hemisphere. In the late austral summer, on the other hand, the trends are reversed. This implies that the summer hemisphere becomes wetter and the winter hemisphere becomes a little drier in the tropics. Thus, the seasonal range of tropical precipitation, differences between wet and dry seasons, is increased. Zonal averages of the precipitation anomalies from the multimodel ensemble also reveal a meridional movement, which basically follows the seasonal migration of the main convection zone. Similar asymmetric features can be found in all 13 climate model simulations used in this study. Based on the moisture budget analysis, the vertical moisture advection associated with mean circulation is the main contribution for the robustness of the asymmetric distribution of the tropical precipitation anomalies. Under global warming, tropospheric water vapor increases as the temperature rises and most enhanced water vapor is in the lower troposphere. The ascending motion of the Hadley circulation then transports more water vapor upward, that is, anomalous moisture convergence, and enhances precipitation over the main convection zones. On the other hand, the thermodynamic effect associated with the descending motion of the Hadley circulation, that is, anomalous moisture divergence, reduces the precipitation over the descending regions. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospherics; Drought; Global warming; Moisture; Tropics; Troposphere; Turbulent flow; Vapors; Asymmetric distributions; Asymmetric features; Austral summers; Boreal summers; Climate Model simulations; Convection zones; Global warming impacts; Hadley circulations; Lower tropospheres; Moisture advections; Moisture convergences; Multimodel ensembles; Northern hemispheres; Ocean climate models; Precipitation anomalies; Seasonal migrations; Southern hemispheres; Temperature rises; Tropical precipitations; Wet and dry seasons; Water vapor; climate modeling; computer simulation; global warming; Hadley cell; moisture; Northern Hemisphere; precipitation (climatology); Southern Hemisphere; troposphere; water vapor",,,,,,"Allan, R.P., Soden, B.J., Large discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation trends in the ascending and descending branches of the tropical circulation (2007) Geophys.
