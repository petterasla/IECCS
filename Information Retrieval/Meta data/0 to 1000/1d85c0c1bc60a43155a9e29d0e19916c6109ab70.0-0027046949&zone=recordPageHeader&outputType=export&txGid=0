Variations in primary biological production, reflecting changes in sea-ice cover and sea surface temperature, in bottom current strength and the size of the grounded continental ice sheet, all contribute to changes in sediment characteristics, in a record extending back many million years. -from Author",,"Antarctic Circumpolar Current; climate change; global warming; ice sheet; Oligocene; sedimentary record; sedimentation; Antarctica; Southern Ocean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027046949
