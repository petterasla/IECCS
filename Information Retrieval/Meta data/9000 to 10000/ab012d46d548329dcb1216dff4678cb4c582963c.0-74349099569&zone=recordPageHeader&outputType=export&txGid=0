Total area under rice cultivation during the years 2005-2006 was 2,048,360 ha in the first crop season and 298,529 ha in the second crop season. The emission of methane from stubble incorporation with manure plus fertilizer application areas in the first crop season was estimated to be 192,783.74 ton higher than stubble with manure, stubble with fertilizer, and stubble without fertilizer areas. The fields with stubble burning emitted the highest emission of methane (75,771.29 ton) followed by stubble burning with manure (22,251.08 ton), stubble burning with fertilizer (13,213.27 ton), and stubble burning with fertilizer application areas (3,222.22 ton). The total emission of methane from rice field in Cambodia for the years 2005-2006 was approximately 342,649.26 ton (342.65 Gg) in the first crop season and 36,838.88 ton (36.84 Gg) in the second crop season. During the first crop season in the years 2005-2006, Battambang province emitted the highest amount of CH 4 (38,764.48 ton) and, in the second crop season during the years 2005-2006, the highest emission (8,262.34 ton) was found in Takeo province (8,262.34 ton). Nitrous oxide emission was between 2.70 and 1,047.92 ton in the first crop season and it ranged from 0 to 244.90 ton in the second crop season. Total nitrous oxide emission from paddy rice field was estimated to be 9,026.28 ton in the first crop season and 1,091.93 ton in the second crop season. Larger area under cultivation is responsible for higher emission of methane and nitrous oxide. Total emission of nitrous oxide by using IPCC default emission coefficient was approximately 2,328.85 ton. The total global warming potential of Cambodian paddy rice soil is 11,723,217.03 ton (11,723 Gg) equivalents of CO2. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Estimation of CH4 and N2O; Greenhouse gas; Paddy agroecosystem; Rice straw management","Agro ecosystems; Cambodia; Emission coefficient; Emission factors; Fertilizer applications; Global warming potential; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Paddy fields; Paddy rice; Rice cultivation; Rice fields; Rice straw management; Rice straws; Stubble burning; Thailand; Total emissions; Anesthetics; Crops; Ecosystems; Estimation; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Manures; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Leakage (fluid); fertilizer; methane; nitrous oxide; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural emission; carbon dioxide; cultivation; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; manure; methane; nitrous oxide; paddy field; rice; soil emission; waste management; agricultural land; agricultural management; air pollution; article; Cambodia; combustion; concentration (parameters); greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; manure; pollution monitoring; rice; straw; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Cambodia; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza sativa; Soil; Battambang; Cambodia; Thailand",,"methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Air Pollutants; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Soil",,,,"Bandyopadhyay, S.K., Estimation and agro-technical description of production systems (2001) Land Use Analysis and Planning for Sustainable Food Security: With An Illustration for the State of Haryana, India, p. 85. , ICAR and IRRI New Delhi and Philippines; Bhatia, A., Pathak, H., Jain, N., Singh, P.K., Singh, A.K., Global warming potential of manure amended soils under rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic plains (2005) Atmospheric Environment, 39 (37), pp. 6976-6984. , DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2005.07.052, PII S1352231005006382; Davidson, E.A., Swank, W.T., Perry, T.O., Distinguishing between nitrification and denitrification as source of gaseous nitrogen production in soil (1986) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 52, pp. 1280-1286. , 1:CAS:528:DyaL2sXkvFWntg%3D%3D; (2006) Report on Plant Breeding and Biotechnology Capacity Survey Thailand, , http://apps3.fao.org/wiews/docs/Thailand%20Full%20Report.pdf, Food and Agriculture Organization; (1996) Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
