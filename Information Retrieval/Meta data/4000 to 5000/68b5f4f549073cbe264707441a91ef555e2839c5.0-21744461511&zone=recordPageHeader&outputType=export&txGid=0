An integrated water and food model with global scope is applied for the analysis. The global climate regime during 1961 to 1990 is used to generate 30 climatic scenarios for the time period 1996 to 2025, and these scenarios are applied to the model in order to characterize the randomness of precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration, which affects both irrigation water supply and demand. The risk with random climate events is represented by reliability, variability, and vulnerability from different perspectives. Regarding irrigation water supply, Colorado will bear an increasingly unstable situation although the average water supply relative to the demand will maintain at a relatively high level; selected basins in China and India indicate that significantly lower levels of reliability and more deleterious affects from drought can be expected, but under a less variable condition due to assumed water storage increase. From 1996 to 2025, the effects of water deficits on irrigated food production are characterized with a nonlinear phenomenon and food production loss will be more sensitive to irrigation water supply deficit in the future. Future work following this paper needs to consider the impact of global climate change and the water quality of the irrigation return flow and result verification by local studies.","Agriculture; Drought; Food production; Irrigation; Risk assessment; River basin","Climate change; Climatology; Evapotranspiration; Runoff; Water resources; Water supply; Climate events; Food production; Irrigation water supply; River basins; Irrigation; climate change; drought; food production; irrigation; risk assessment; water demand; water supply; Evaporation; Irrigation; Meteorology; Runoff; Water Resources; Water Supply",,,,,,"Alcamo, J., Döll, P., Kaspar, F., Siebert, S., (1998) Global Change and Global Scenarios of Water Use and Availability: An Application of Water GAP 1.0, , Center for Environmental System Research (CESR), University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany; Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., Crop Evapotranspiration, Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements (1998) FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56, , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy; Batchelor, C., Improving Water Use Efficiency as Part of Integrated Catchment Management (1999) Agricultural Water Management, 40 (2), pp. 249-263; Cai, X., Rosegrant, M.W., Global Water Demand and Supply Projections.
