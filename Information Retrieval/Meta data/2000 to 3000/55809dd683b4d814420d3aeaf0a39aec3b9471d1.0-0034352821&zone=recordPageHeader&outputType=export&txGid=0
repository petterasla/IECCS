A particularly severe fog episode lasted from mid-December, 1998 to early January, 1999. The fog caused extensive economic damage and disruptions in transport. We determined concentrations of SO<inf>4</inf>2-, NO<inf>3</inf>-, and selected trace elements at Lahore, Pakistan during and after the fog event by collecting aerosols on Whatman 41 filters every 12 h. SO<inf>4</inf>2- concentrations of up to 100 μg/m3 were observed during fog. The SO<inf>4</inf>2-/Se ratios and trace element data suggest a distant source of SO<inf>4</inf>2- aerosols, hundreds of kms away. Lahore was downwind of coal-burning in India during the fog. The high concentrations of SO<inf>4</inf>2- observed suggest a more extensive investigation of the chemistry and transport processes in this region is necessary to delineate emission sources and develop control strategies as there are serious likely effects on human health and economy in a region populated by hundreds of millions of people, and on global climate change through direct and indirect forcing.",,"fog; winter; India; Pakistan; Atmospheric aerosols; Climate change; Cold weather problems; Economic and social effects; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Sulfur compounds; Trace elements; Transport properties; Economic damage; Global climate change; Winter; Fog",,,,,,"Arndt, R.L., Carmichael, G.R., Streets, D.G., Bhatti, N., Sulfur dioxide emissions and sectorial contributions to sulfur deposition in Asia (1997) Atmos.
