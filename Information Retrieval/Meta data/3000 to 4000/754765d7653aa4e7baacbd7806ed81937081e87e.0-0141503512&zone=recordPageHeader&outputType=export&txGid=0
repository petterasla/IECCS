We investigated the effects of CO2 and temperature on the interaction between gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) larvae and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) saplings by bagging first instar larvae within open-top chambers at four CO2/temperature treatments: (1) ambient temperature, ambient CO2, (2) ambient temperature, elevated CO 2(+300 μl l-1CO2), (3) elevated temperature (+3.5°C), ambient CO2, and (4) elevated temperature, elevated CO2. Larvae were reared to pupation and leaf samples taken biweekly to determine levels of total N, water, non-structural carbohydrates, and an estimate of defensive phenolic compounds in three age classes of foliage: (1) immature, (2) mid-mature and (3) mature. Elevated growth temperature marginally reduced (P &lt;0.1) leaf N and significantly reduced (P &lt;0.05) leaf water across CO2 treatments in mature leaves, whereas leaves grown at elevated CO2 concentration had a significant decrease in leaf N and a significant increase in the ratio of starch: N and total non-structural carbohydrates:N. Leaf N and water decreased and starch:N and total non-structural carbohydrates:N ratios increased as leaves aged. Phenolics were unaffected by CO2 or temperature treatment. There were no interactive effects of CO2 and temperature on any phytochemical measure. Gypsy moth larvae reached pupation earlier at the elevated temperature (female =8 days, P &lt;0.07; male =7.5 days, P &lt;0.03), whereas mortality and pupal fresh weight of insects were unrelated to either CO2, temperature or their interaction. Our data show that CO2 or temperature-induced alterations in leaf constituents had no effect on insect performance; instead, the long-term exposure to a 3.5°C increase in temperature shortened insect development but had no effect on pupal weight. It appears that in some tree-herbivorous insect systems the direct effects of an increased global mean temperature may have greater consequences for altering plant-insect interactions than the indirect effects of an increased temperature or CO2 concentration on leaf constituents.","Acer rubrum; Elevated temperature; Global climate change; Lymantria dispar; Pupal weight","carbon dioxide; nitrogen; water; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; larval development; plant-herbivore interaction; temperature; animal; article; feeding behavior; larva; metabolism; moth; physiology; plant leaf; temperature; tree; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Feeding Behavior; Larva; Moths; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Temperature; Trees; Water; Acer; Acer rubrum; Animalia; Hexapoda; Insecta; Invertebrata; Lepidoptera; Lymantria; Lymantria dispar; Lymantriidae",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Appel, H.M., Governor, H.L., D'Ascenzo, M., Siska, E., Schultz, J.C., Limitations of folin assays of foliar phenolics in ecological studies (2001) J Chem Ecol, 27, pp. 761-778; Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Awmack, C., Bezemer, M.T., Brown, V., Butterflield, J., Whittaker, J.B., Herbivory in global climate change research: Direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Global Change Biol, 8, pp. 1-16; Bezemer, T.M., Jones, T.H., Knight, K.J., Long-term effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on populations of the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae and its parasitoid Aphidius matricariae (1998) Oecologia, 116, pp. 128-135; Booker, F.L., Maier, C.A., Atmospheric carbon dioxide, irrigation, and fertilization effects on phenolic and nitrogen concentrations in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) needles (2001) Tree Physiol, 21, pp. 609-616; Buse, A., Good, J.E.D., Dury, S., Perrins, C.M., Effects of elevated temperature and carbon dioxide on the nutritional quality of leaves of oak (Quercus robur L.) as food for the winter moth (Operophtera brumata L.)
