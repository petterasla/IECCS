The output level was calculated in the form of annual grain equivalent at aggregate level for 104 agricultural commodities except livestock products. Output level was specified as a function of total physical, fertilizer and seed energy, and ordinary least squares was employed to estimate equation parameters. The results show that total energy input has increased from 19.6 GJ/ha in 1975 to 45.7 GJ/ha in 2000, whereas total output energy has risen from 27.1 GJ/ha to a level of 39.1 GJ/ha. Energy efficiency indicators, input-output ratio, energy productivity and net energy have declined over the examined period. Total physical and fertilizer energy, particularly nitrogen, significantly contributed to output level with elasticities of 0.24 and 0.14, respectively. The results also revealed that non-renewable, direct and indirect energy forms had a positive impact on output level. Moreover, Turkish agriculture has experienced a substantial increase in non-renewable energy use. This inefficient energy use pattern in the Turkish agriculture can create some environmental problems such as increase in global warming, CO2 emissions, and non-sustainability. Thus, policy makers should undertake new policy tools to ensure sustainability and efficient energy use. © Elsevier Ltd.
