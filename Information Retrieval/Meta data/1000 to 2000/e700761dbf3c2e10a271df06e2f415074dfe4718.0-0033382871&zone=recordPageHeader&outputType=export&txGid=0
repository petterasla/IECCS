However, the strength of this OMZ may have been sensitive to late Quaternary oceancirculation and productivity changes along the margin. Although sediment-lamination strength has been used to trace ocean-oxygenation changes in the past, oxygen levels on the open margin are not sufficiently low for laminations to from. In these regions, benthic foraminifera are highly sensitive monitors of OMZ strength, and their fossil assemblages can be used to reconstruct past fluctuations. Benthic forminiferal assemblages from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1017, off Point Conception, exhibit major and rapid faunal oscillations in response to late Quaternary millennial-scale climate change (Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles) on the open central California margin. These faunal oscillations can be correlated to and are apparently synchronous with those reporede from Santa Barbara Basin. Together they represent major flucuations in the strength of the OMZ which were intimately association with global climate change - weakening, perhaps disappearing, during cool periods and strengthening during warm periods. These rapid, major OMZ strength fluctuation were apparently widespread on the Northeast Pacific margin and must have influenced the evolution of margin biota and altered biogeochemical cycles with potential feedbacks to global climate change.",,"oxygen minimum layer; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; Quaternary; Pacific Ocean",,,,,,"Anderson, R.Y., Gardner, J.V., Hemphill-Haley, E., Variability of the late Pleistocene-Holocene oxygen-minimum zone off northern California (1989) Aspects of Climate Variability in the Pacific and Western Americas, 55, pp. 75-84. , Peterson, D.
