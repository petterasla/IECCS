Location: The Western Hemisphere. Methods: We used digitized range maps of breeding birds to estimate the species richness at two grain sizes, 756 and 12,100 km2. We then used molecular phylogenies resolved to family to quantify the root distance (RD) of each species as a measure of its level of evolutionary development. Birds were classified as 'basal' or 'derived' based on the RD of their family, and richness patterns were contrasted for the most basal and most derived 30% of species. We also generated temperature estimates for the Palaeogene across the Western Hemisphere to examine how spatial covariation between past and present climates might make it difficult to distinguish between ecological and evolutionary hypotheses for the current richness gradient. Results: The warm, wet tropics support many species from basal bird clades, whereas the northern temperate zone and cool or dry tropics are dominated by species from more recent, evolutionarily derived clades. Furthermore, crucial to evaluating how niche conservatism among birds may drive the hemispherical richness gradient, the spatial structure of the richness gradient for basal groups is statistically indistinguishable from the overall gradient, whereas the richness gradient for derived groups is much shallower than the overall gradient. Finally, modern temperatures and the pattern of climate cooling since the Eocene are indistinguishable as predictors of bird species richness. Main conclusions: Differences in the richness gradients of basal vs. derived clades suggest that the hemispherical gradient has been strongly influenced by the differential extirpation of species in older, warm-adapted clades from parts of the world that have become cooler in the present. We propose that niche conservatism and global-scale climate change over evolutionary time provide a parsimonious explanation for the contemporary bird latitudinal diversity gradient in the New World, although dispersal limitation of some highly derived clades probably plays a secondary role. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Evolutionary time; Extinction; Latitudinal gradient; Mean root distance; New World birds; Palaeoclimate; Species; Species diversity","bird; breeding; climate change; Eocene; latitudinal gradient; nature conservation; species richness; Aves",,,,,,"Barker, F.K., Cibois, A., Schilker, P., Feinstein, J., Cracraft, J., Phylogeny and diversification of the largest avian radiation (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 101, pp. 11040-11045; Behrensmeyer, A.K., Damuth, J.D., Dimichele, W.D., Potts, R., Sues, H.-D., Wing, S.L., (1992) Terrestrial Ecosystems Through Time: Evolutionary Paleoecology of Terrestrial Plants and Animals, , University of Chicago Press Chicago (eds); Bennett, P.M., Owens, I.P.F., (2002) Evolutionary Ecology of Birds: Life Histories, Mating Systems, and Extinction, , Oxford University Press Oxford; Böhning-Gaese, K., Oberrath, R., Macroecology of habitat choice in long-distance migratory birds (2003) Oecologia, 137, pp. 296-303; Bromham, L., Cardillo, M., Testing the link between the latitudinal gradient in species richness and rates of molecular evolution (2003) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 16, pp. 200-207; Cardillo, M., Latitude and rates of diversification in birds and butterflies (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences, 266, pp. 1221-1225; Clifford, P., Richardson, S., Helmon, D., Assessing the significance of the correlation between two spatial processes (1989) Biometrics, 45, pp. 123-134; Coates, A.G., Collins, L.S., Aubry, M.-P., Berggren, W.A., The geology of the Darien, Panama, and the late Miocene-Pliocene collision of the Panama arc with northwestern South America (2004) Geological Society of America Bulletin, 116, pp. 1327-1344; Collinson, M.E., Cenozoic evolution of modern plant communities and vegetation (2000) Biotic Responses to Global Change: The Last 145 Million Years, pp. 223-243. , ed. by.
