Here we propose potential effects of increased temperatures on ecologically dominant New Zealand grasses (Chinochloa spp.) that mass flower and mast seed. Twenty-two years' data from fave masting Chionochloa species in New Zealand showed that the cue for heavy flowering was unusually high temperatre in the summer of the year before flowering. Attack by predispersal insect seed predators was much reduced in mast years, apparently because predator populations were satiated. Increased temperatures would greatly decrease interannual variation in Chionochloa flowering, allowing seed predator populations to increase and potentially to devastate the seed crop annually. Similar responses are likely in masting species worldwide. This previously unrecognized effect of global warming could have widespread impacts on temperate ecosystems.",,"alpine grassland; flowering; global warming; masting plant; plant-insect interaction; seed predator; New Zealand",,,,,,"Allen, R.B., Platt, K.H., Annual seedfall variation in Nothofagus solandri (Fagaceae), Canterbury, New Zealand (1990) Oikos, 57, pp. 199-206; Brockie, R.E., Periodic heavy flowering of New Zealand flax (Phormium, Agavaceae) (1986) New Zealand Journal of Botany, 24, pp. 381-386; Bunin, J.S., Jamieson, I.G., New approaches toward a better understanding of the decline of takahe (Porphyrio mantelli) in New Zealand (1995) Conservation Biology, 9, pp. 100-106; Connor, H.E., Breeding systems in New Zealand grasses.
