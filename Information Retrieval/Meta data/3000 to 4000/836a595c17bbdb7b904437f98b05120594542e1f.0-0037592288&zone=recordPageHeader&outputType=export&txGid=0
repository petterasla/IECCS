Daily runoff and drainage calculated by the land-surface scheme are used as input to a hydrological model to diagnose changes in the Yangtze River and Zhujiang River discharges. In the future climate, the simulated annual cycle of precipitation over the southeastern coastal area of China is systematically shifted about 1 mo ahead compared with the present-day climate, and the rainy season starts 1 mo earlier for the Yangtze River Valley and North China. In line with the surface-warming distribution change, the East Asian summer monsoon (EAM) flow strengthens. This causes increased precipitation in North China. In winter, the subtropical part of the EAM flow strengthens and leads to a large increase in rainfall over the EAM region. The discharges of the Zhujiang and Yangtze rivers in the future climate decrease in the late summer and autumn, to which both increased evaporation and an early retreat of the monsoon rainfall contribute. In the early and mid-summer, the Yangtze River discharge increases, mainly due to the large increase in precipitation in the preceding months, which has been stored in the catchment.","East Asian monsoon; Global warning; River discharge; Time-slice experiment","atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; global warming; monsoon; river discharge; China",,,,,,"Bacher, A., Oberhuber, J.M., Roeckner, E., ENSO dynamics and seasonal cycle in the tropical Pacific as simulated by the ECHAM4/OPYC3 coupled general circulation model (1998) Clim Dyn, 14, pp. 431-450; Bengtsson, L., Botzet, M., Esch, M., Hurricane-type vortices in a general circulation model (1995) Tellus, 47 A, pp. 175-196; Bueh, C., Ji, L., Anomalous activity of East Asian winter monsoon and the tropical Pacific SSTA (1999) Chin Sci Bull, 44, pp. 890-898; Bueh, C., Ji, L., The ocean-atmosphere coupled regimes and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) activity (1999) Adv Atmos Sci, 16, pp. 91-106; Chang, C.P., Zhang, Y., Li, T., Interannual and interdecadal variations of East Asian summer monsoon and tropical Pacific SSTs.
