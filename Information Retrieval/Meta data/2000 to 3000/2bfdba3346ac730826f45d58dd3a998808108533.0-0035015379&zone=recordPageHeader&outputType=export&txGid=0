The global cooling during the Tertiary caused a series of narrow distribution regions of the plants. Quartemary glaciation invaded most regions of North America and Eurasia where severe destruction was imposed onto vegetation. However, such destruction was lessened in China largely because of specific topographic and geographical and obviously, a number of other conditions accounted for an unusual refugee camp for the relics of plants in China, among which lots of endemic taxa exist. Recently, Chinese endemic species, such as Metaseqouia, Eucommia, have been employed to conduct multi-disciplinary comprehensive studies so as to analyze Tertiary climate changes quantitatively. Meanwhile, a rigorous method, i.e. climate analysis of endemic species (CAES) has come to maturation. This method is characteristic of some generality because it is supposed to be applicable to the endemic species in other regions of the world. CAES is involved in the following aspects: 1. Conduct multidisciplinary studies on living and fossil species of endemic plants and trace their evolutionary courses. 2. Compare fossil species with living one and clarify which is the nearest living relative (NLR) to fossil counterpart. 3. Fossils and their living counterparts (NLR) are supposed to have similar ecological requirements to meet their life cycles. 4. Investigate the geographic distribution of living and fossil plants within the same taxa and ascertain the dynamic changes of their distributions in geological age. 5. Analyze climate factors in the distribution of specific endemic taxa and obtain the data of climatic characters which are suitable for reconstruction of paleoclimate where fossil counterparts lived. 6. Further study the physio-ecology of living species and determinate paleoclimate where fossil counterparts lived. 7. Integrate analysis of the data from steps 4, 5 and 6, and quantitatively reconstruct the climate where fossil and living plants survive.","Endemic species; Global Climate; Quantitative analysis; Tertiary","climate change; endemic species; global change; quantitative analysis; Tertiary; China",,,,,,"Zhang, Z.-Q., Sun, C.-Q., Proceedings of global changes in recent decade (1999) Chin Bull Sci, 44, pp. 464-477. , (in Chinese); Ding, Z.-L., Sun, J.-M., The record of magenetostigraphy and eolian sediment from sequence of loess and red clay in Lingtai (1998) Quarter Sci, 1, pp. 86-94. , (in Chinese with English abstract); Ye, D.-Z., Chen, B.-Q., (1992) A Preliminary Study of Global Changes in China, , Beijing: Earthquake Press, (in Chinese); Berner, R.A., 3 Geocard: A revised model of atmospheric CO2 over Phanerozoic time (1994) Amer J Sci, 291, pp. 56-91; Berner, R.A., The rise of plants and their effect on weathering and atmospheric CO2 (1997) Science, 276, pp. 544-546; Li, C.-S., Wang, Y.-F., Sun, Q.-C., Song, S.-Y., Geng, B.-Y., Meditation on plant evolution influenced by bolide-impact events (1998) Bull Nat Sci Found Chin, 12, pp. 21-25. , (in Chinese with English abstract); Wolfe, J., A palaeoclimatic estimates from Tertiary leaf assemblages (1995) Ann Rev Earth Planet Sci, 23, pp. 119-142; Wiemann, M.C., Wheeler, E.A., Manchester, S.R., Portier, K.M., Dicotyledonous wood anatomical characters as predictors of climate (1998) Palaeogeogr Palaeoclimatol Palaeoecol, 139, pp. 83-100; McElwain, J.C., Chaloner, W.G., Stomatal density and index of fossil plants track atmospheric carbon dioxide in the Palaeozoic (1995) Ann Bot, 76, pp. 389-395; McElwain, J.C., Chaloner, W.G., The fossil cuticle as a askeletal record of environmental change (1996) Palaios, 11, pp. 376-388; Mosbrugger, V., The coexistence approach: A method for quantitative reconstruction of Tertiary terrestrial paleoclimate data using plant fossils (1997) Palaeogeogr Palaeoclimatol Palaeoecol, 134, pp. 61-86; Ying, T.-S., Zhang, Y.-L., Boufford, D.E., (1993) The Endemic Genera of Seed Plants of China, , Beijing: Science Press; Mai, D.H., (1995) Tertiare Vegetationsgeschichtes Europas, , Jena: Gustav Fische; Call, V.B., Dilcher, D.L., Fossil record of Eucommia (Eucommiacease) in North America (1997) Amer J Bot, 84, pp. 798-814; Wolfe, J.A., A paleobotanical interpretation of tertiary climates in the Northern Hemisphere (1978) Amer Sci, 66, pp. 694-703; Liu, Y.-J., Li, C.-S., Wang, Y.-F., Studies on fossil Metasequia from North-east China and their taxonomic implications (1999) Bot J Linn Soc, 130, pp. 267-297; Spicer, R.A., Parrish, J.T., Late cretaceous-early tertiary paleoclimates of the northern high latitudes: A quantitative view (1986) Q J Geol Soc London, 147, pp. 329-341; Wolfe, J.A., Upchurch, G.R., North American non-marine climates and vegetation during the late Cretaceous (1987) Palaeogeogr Palaeoclimatol Palaeoecol, 61, pp. 33-77; Wang, Y.-F., Li, C.-S., Cui, J.-Z., Eucommia Cf.
