The complexities of precipitation changes, vegetation- climate feedbacks and direct physiological effects of CO2 on vegetation present particular challenges for climate change modelling of and regions. Great uncertainties exist in the prediction of and ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 and global warming. Palaeodata provide important information about the past frequency, intensity and subregional patterns of change in the world's deserts that cannot always be captured by the climatic models. However, it is important to bear in mind that the global mechanisms of Quaternary climatic variability were different from present-day trends, and any direct analogies between the past and present should be treated with great caution. Although palaeodata provide valuable information about possible past changes in the vegetation-climate system, it is unlikely that the history of the world's deserts is a key for their future. © Arnold 2004.","Arid lands; Climate change","arid environment; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change",,,,,,"Aubekerov, B.Zh., Chalihjan, E.V., Zakupova, Sh.A., Variations of climate and palaeogeographical conditions in Central Kazakhstan during the Late Glaciation and Holocene (1989) Paleoclimati Pozdnelednikovia I Golocena, pp. 98-102. , Velichko, A.A. and Klimanov, V.A., editors, Moscow, Nauka, (in Russian); Bachelet, D., Neilson, R.P., Lenihan, J.M., Drapek, R., Climatic change effects on vegetation distribution and carbon budget in the United States (2001) Ecosystems, 4, pp. 164-185; Bartlein, P.J., Anderson, K.H., Anderson, P.M., Edwards, M.E., Mock, P.J., Thompson, R.S., Webb, R.S., Whitlock, C., Paleoclimatic simulation for North America over the past 21,000 years: Features of the simulated climate and comparisons with paleoenvironmental data (1998) Quaternary Science Review, 17, pp. 549-585; Batchelor, D.A.E., Improved sustainability in Australia from the greenhouse effect?
