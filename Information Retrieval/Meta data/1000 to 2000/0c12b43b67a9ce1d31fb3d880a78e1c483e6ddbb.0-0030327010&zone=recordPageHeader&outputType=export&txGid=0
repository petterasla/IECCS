The authors observed the greenhouse-effect of carbon dioxide, whose contribution ratio to warming is most high. Now the concentration of carbon dioxide is presently approximately 350 ppm, and is estimated to become 400 ppm in the year 2000. An absorption-fixation method was applied photosynthesis by Water Hyacinth an aquatic plant. Also, an apparatus was developed that can accurately measure the concentration of carbon dioxide. The authors suggest a plant-cultivating apparatus whose temperature, humidity and illumination can be controlled, and maintains the interior of the cultivating room at constant conditions, for growing Water Hyacinth. A continuous 24-hours measurement was carried out of carbon dioxide in the cultivating apparatus using a gas chromatograph with an auto sampler. We could accurately measure the carbon dioxide concentration in plant cultivating apparatus using this apparatus.","Fixation of carbon dioxide; Plants cultivating apparatus; Water Hyacinth",,,,,,,"Japanese sourceJapanese sourceJapanese source","Ishii, T.; Okayama University of Science, 1-1, Ridai-chou, Okayama-shi, Okayarna 700, Japan",,,,,,,,05251931,,,,"Japanese","Bunseki Kagaku",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030327010
