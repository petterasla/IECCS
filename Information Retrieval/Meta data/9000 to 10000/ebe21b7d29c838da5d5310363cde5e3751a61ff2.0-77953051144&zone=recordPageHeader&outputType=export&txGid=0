HFC-134a is being phased out in the European Union due to high global warming potential. HFO-1234yf is highly energy efficient, exhibits low toxicity, and can potentially be used in systems currently designed for refrigerant HFC-134a with minimal modifications. Significant work has been completed to assess the flammability characteristics of HFO-1234yf. Though it is flammable per ASTM E-681, it is significantly less so than HFC-152a which has also been considered as an HFC-134a alternative. HFO-1234yf has a relatively high lower flammability limit at 6.2 vol% in air. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling has shown it is very unlikely the lower flammability limit will be reached when the refrigerant is leaked into the passenger compartment ofa vehicle. HFO-1234yf also has a high minimum ignition energy (MIE) from 5,000 to 10,000 mJ which indicates there may be very few potential ignition sources in a vehicle. It also has very low burning velocity at 1.5 cm/sec indicating low potential for damage should an ignition occur. Several automotive industry groups have completed extensive risk assessments which have concluded HFO-1234yfis safe to use as a refrigerant in vehicles. This article will review flammability test results and challenges that were overcome to measure flammability of a mildly flammable refrigerant as well as CFD modeling work for vehicle leakage scenarios. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Cfd; Flammability; Gwp; Hfo-1234yf; Refrigerant","Automotive air-conditioning systems; Burning velocity; Cfd; CFD modeling; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Energy efficient; European Union; Flammability characteristics; Flammable refrigerants; Global warming potential; HFC-134A; In-vehicle; Low toxicity; Lower flammability limits; Minimum ignition energy; Passenger compartment; Potential ignition sources; Test results; Automotive industry; Computational fluid dynamics; Flammability testing; Global warming; Hafnium compounds; Ignition; Refrigerants; Risk assessment; Risk management; Vehicles; Flammability",,,,,,"IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change, , http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/assessments-reports.htm, Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change, available at; Minor, B., Spatz, M., HFO-1234yf low GWP refrigerant update (2008) International Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Conference At Purdu, , West Lafayette, Indiana, July 14-17; Standard test method for concentration limits of flammability of chemicals (vapors and gases) (2004) American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), , West Conshohocken, PA; Venetsanos, A.G., Papanikolaou, E., Delichatsios, M., Garcia, J., Hansen, O.R., Heitsch, M., Huser, A., Voorl, V.D.M.M., An inter-comparison exercise on the capabilities of CFD models to predict the short and long term distribution and mixing of hydrogen in a garage (2009) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 34, pp. 5912-5923; Herrmann, D., Explosion consequences of low velocity releases of dense flammable vapor inside a chemical manufacturing facility with a complex ventilation system (2006) Presented at AIChE Spring National Meeting, 40th Annual Loss Prevention Symposium, , Orlando, FL; Takizawa, K., Test report on estimation of maximum burning velocity of 1234yf (2007) Communication to Honeywell and DuPont from National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), , November 7; Standard test method for minimum ignition energy and quenching distance in gaseous mixtures (2007) American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), , West Conshohocken, PA; Smith, N.D., Determining minimum ignition energies and quenching distances for difficult to ignite compounds (2003) ASTM J Test Eval, 31, pp. 178-182; Jabbour, T., Clodic, D., Flammable refrigerant classification in accordance with combustion parameters and consequences in terms of risk of usage (2003) Final Report to Atofina/Carrier/Canfoss/ Daikin/Dupont/EDF/Solvay Consortium, , Paris, France, December; Britton, L.G., Avoiding static ignition hazards in chemical operations (1999) Appendix B, p. 223. , AICHE; Minor, B., Herrmann, D., Gravell, R., Flammability characteristics of low GWP refrigerant HFO-1234yf (2009) Loss Prevention Symposium Proceedings, pp. 589-604. , Orlando, FL; Herrmann, D., Why use CFD for explosion studies (2007) Process Saf Prog, 27, pp. 143-175; Hansen, O., Middha, P., CFD-based risk assessment for hydrogen applications (2008) Process Saf Prog, 27, pp. 29-34; Dharmavaram, S., Hanna, S., Hansen, O., Consequence analysis-Using a CFD model for industrial sites (2005) Process Saf Prog, 24, pp. 316-322","Minor, B.
