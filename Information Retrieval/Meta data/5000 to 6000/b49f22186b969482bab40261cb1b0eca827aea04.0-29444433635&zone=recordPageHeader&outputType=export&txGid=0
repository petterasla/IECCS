In ecosystems where marked biodiversity changes occur at seasonal time scales, it is easier to relate them with ecosystem functioning. The objective of this work is to analyse the relationship between phytoplankton diversity and primary production in St. André coastal lagoon - SW Portugal. This lagoon is artificially opened to the sea every year in early spring, exhibiting a shift from a marine dominated to a low salinity ecosystem in winter. Data on salinity, temperature, nutrients, phytoplankton species composition, chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and primary production were analysed over a year. Modelling studies based on production-irradiance curves were also conducted. A total of 19 taxa were identified among diatoms, dinoflagellates and euglenophyceans, the less abundant group. Lowest diversities (Shannon-Wiener index) were observed just before the opening to the sea. Results show a negative correlation (p&lt;0.05) between diversity and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration (0.2-40.3 mg Chl a m-3). Higher Chl a values corresponded to periods when the community was dominated by the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum (&gt;90% of cell abundance) and production was maximal (up to 234.8 mg C m-3 h-1). Maximal photosynthetic rates (P max) (2.0-22.5 mg C mg Chl a -1 h-1) were higher under lower Chl a concentrations. The results of this work suggest that decreases in diversity are associated with increases in biomass and production, whereas increases correspond to opposite trends. It is suggested that these trends, contrary to those observed in terrestrial and in some benthic ecosystems, may be a result of low habitat diversity in the water column and resulting competitive pressure. The occurrence of the highest photosynthetic rates when Chl a is low, under some of the highest diversities, suggests a more efficient use of irradiance under low biomass-high diversity conditions. Results suggest that this increased efficiency is not explained by potential reductions in nutrient limitation and intraspecific competition under lower biomasses and may be a result of niche complementarity. © Springer 2006.","Coastal lagoons; Phytoplankton diversity; Production","Biomass; Climate change; Coastal zones; Correlation methods; Ecosystems; Marine biology; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Production; Coastal lagoons; Negative correlation; Phytoplankton diversity; Seasonal time scales; Biodiversity; biodiversity; coastal lagoon; ecosystem function; phytoplankton; Eurasia; Europe; Portugal; Southern Europe; Bacillariophyta; Dinophyceae; Euglenida; Prorocentrum minimum",,,,,,"(1992) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 18th Edn., , Washington; Agard, J.B.R., Hubbard, R.H., Griffith, J.K., The relation between productivity, disturbance and the biodiversity of Caribbean phytoplankton: Applicability of Huston's dynamic equilibrium model (1996) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 202, pp. 1-17; Banse, K., Cell volumes, maximal growth rates of univellular algae and ciliates, and the role of ciliates in the marine pelagial (1982) Limnology and Oceanography, 27, pp. 1059-1071; Bernardo, J.M., (1990) Dinâmica de Uma Lagoa Costeira Eutrófica (Lagoa de Santo André), 322p. , Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Lisbon; Brock, T.D., Calculating solar radiation for ecological studies (1981) Ecological Modelling, 14, pp. 1-19; Cancela Da Fonseca, L.M.Q., (1989) Estudo Da Influência Da ""abertura Ao Mar"" Sobre Um Sistema Lagunar Costeiro: A Lagoa de Santo André, 355p. , Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Lisbon; Cancela Da Fonseca, L.M.Q., Costa, A.M., Bernardo, J.M., Seasonal variation of benthic and fish communities in a shallow land-locked coastal lagoon (St. André, SW Portugal) (1989) Scientia Marina, 53, pp. 663-669; Connell, J., Diversity in tropical rain forests and coral reefs (1978) Science, 199, pp. 1304-1310; Davison, I.R., Environmental effects on algal photosynthesis: Temperature (1991) Journal of Phycology, 27, pp. 2-8; Dogde, J.D., The Prorocentrales (dinophyceae).
