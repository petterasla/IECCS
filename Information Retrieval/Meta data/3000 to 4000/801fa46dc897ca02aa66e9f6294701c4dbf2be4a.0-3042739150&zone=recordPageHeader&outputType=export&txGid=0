Under the IS92a ""business as usual"" emissions scenario CO2 concentrations reached about 980 ppmv by 2100, which is about 280 ppmv higher than when these feedbacks were ignored. The major contribution to the increased CO2 arose from reductions in soil carbon because global warming is assumed to accelerate respiration. However, there was also a lesser contribution from an alarming loss of the Amazonian rainforest. This paper describes the phenomenon of Amazonian forest dieback under elevated CO2 in the Hadley Centre climate-carbon cycle model. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; dieback; general circulation model; global warming; rainforest; twenty first century; Amazonia; South America",,,,,,"AchutaRao, K., Sperber, K.R., Simulation of the El Nino Southern Oscillation: Results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (2002) Climate Dynamics, 19, pp. 191-210; Bacastow, R., Keeling, C., Atmospheric CO2 and the southern oscillation: Effects associated with recent El Nino events (1981) WMO/ICSU/UNEP Scientific Conference on Analysis and Interpretation of Atmospheric CO2 Data WMO, WCP14. , World Clim.
