Confident reporting of trace gas emissions from mangrove sediments at local levels is important for regional emissions inventories, since small changes in N 2O and CH 4 fluxes greatly influence greenhouse gas budgets due to their high global warming potentials. It is also important to identify the drivers of trace gas emission, to prioritise management for minimising emissions. We measured N 2O and CH 4 fluxes and abiotic sediment parameters at midday low tide in winter and summer seasons, at four sites (27°33'S, 152°59'E) ranging from estuary to ocean sub-tropical mangrove sediments, having varied anthropogenic impacts. At all sites, sediment N 2O and CH 4 emissions were significantly lower during winter (7-26 μg N 2O m -2.h -1; 47-466 μg CH 4 m -2.h -1) compared to summer (28-202 μg N 2O m -2.h -1; 247-1570 μg CH 4 m -2.h -1). Sediment temperature, ranging from 18 to 33 °C, strongly influenced N 2O and CH 4 emissions. Highest emissions (202 μg N 2O m -2.h -1, 1570 μg CH 4 m -2.h -1) were detected at human-impacted estuary sites, which generally had higher total carbon (&lt;8%) and total nitrogen (&lt;0.4%) in sediments and reduced salinity (&lt;16 dS.m -1). Large between-site variation highlights the need for regular monitoring of sub-tropical mangroves to capture short-lived, episodic N 2O and CH 4 flux events that are affected by sediment biophysico-chemical conditions at site level. This is important, particularly at sites receiving anthropogenic nutrients, and that have variable freshwater inputs and tidal hydrology. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Anthropogenic inputs; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Salinity; Tidal estuary; Wetland","methane; nitrous oxide; anthropogenic effect; biophysics; emission inventory; estuarine sediment; freshwater input; global warming; greenhouse gas; mangrove; methane; nitrous oxide; salinity; seasonal variation; sediment chemistry; trace gas; article; Australia; chemistry; Rhizophoraceae; season; sediment; Australia; Geologic Sediments; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Rhizophoraceae; Seasons; Australia; Rhizophoraceae",,"methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Allen, D.E., Dalal, R.C., Rennenberg, H., Meyer, R.L., Reeves, S., Schmidt, S., Spatial and temporal variation of nitrous oxide and methane flux between subtropical mangrove sediments and the atmosphere (2007) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 39, pp. 622-631; Allen, D.E., Kingston, G., Rennenberg, H., Dalal, R.C., Schmidt, S., Effect of nitrogen fertilizer management and waterlogging on nitrous oxide emission from subtropical sugarcane soils (2009) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, , in press. doi:; Alongi, D.M., Coastal ecosystem processes (1998), CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, USAAlongi, D.M., Pfitzner, J., Trott, L.A., Tirendi, F., Dixon, P., Klumpp, D.W., Rapid sediment accumulation and microbial mineralization in forests of the mangrove Kandelia candel in the Jiulongjiang Estuary, China (2005) Estuarine, Coastal & Shelf Science, 63, pp. 605-618; (2004), Australian Bureau of Statistics.
