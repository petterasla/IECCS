In particular, the sensitivity of climate to changing greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere and the radiative forcing effects by aerosols are not well constrained, leading to large uncertainties in global warming simulations. Here we present a Monte Carlo approach to produce probabilistic climate projections, using a climate model of reduced complexity. The uncertainties in the input parameters and in the model itself are taken into account, and past observations of oceanic and atmospheric warming are used to constrain the range of realistic model responses. We obtain a probability density function for the present-day total radiative forcing, giving 1.4 to 2.4 W m-2 for the 5-95 per cent confidence range, narrowing the global-mean indirect aerosol effect to the range of 0 to -1.2 W m-2. Ensemble simulations for two illustrative emission scenarios suggest a 40 per cent probability that global-mean surface temperature increase will exceed the range predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but only a 5 per cent probability that warming will fall below that range.",,"Atmospheric aerosols; Monte Carlo methods; Probability density function; Sensitivity analysis; Radiative forcing; Climate change; climate change; forecasting method; Monte Carlo analysis; radiative forcing; aerosol; article; atmosphere; climate change; global climate; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Monte Carlo method; ocean environment; priority journal; probability; simulation; temperature",,,,,,"Houghton, J.T., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , Cambridge Univ.
