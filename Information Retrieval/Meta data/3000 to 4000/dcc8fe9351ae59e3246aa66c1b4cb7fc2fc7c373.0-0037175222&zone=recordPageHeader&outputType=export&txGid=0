Here I tested the hypothesis that variations in climatic conditions, particularly increased precipitation during the 1997-98 El Niño event, buffer harsh abiotic conditions and enhance the performance of this nuisance species. I monitored the growth and reproductive output of P. australis in the year before, during, and after the 1997-98 El Niño in coastal brackish marshes of southern New England, USA. During the El Niño year, P. australis produced on average 30% more shoots, which were 25% taller, and yielded an order of magnitude more inflorescences than in the other 2 years. Soil porewater salinities were negatively related to precipitation during the 3 years of the study, and the growing season during the El Niño year was one of the wettest of the past century. Consequently, increased precipitation during El Niño may facilitate the spread of less salt-tolerant nuisance and invasive species throughout brackish and salt marshes.","Coastal marshes; El Niño; Global climate change; Invasive species; La Niña; Phragmites australis; Salinity; Temperature","biological invasion; climate change; climate conditions; El Nino; grass; marsh; population growth; climate; El Nino; growing season; hypothesis; precipitation; rural area; salt marsh; seashore; species invasion; United States; United States; Phragmites australis",,,,,,"Allison, S.K., The influence of rainfall variability on the species composition of a northern California salt marsh assemblage (1992) Vegetatio, 101, pp. 145-160; Allison, S.K., Recruitment and establishment of salt marsh plants following disturbance by flooding (1996) Am Midl Nat, 136, pp. 232-247; Bertness, M.D., Ewanchuk, P.J., Latitudinal and climate-driven variation in the strength and nature of biological interactions (2002) Oecologia, 132, pp. 392-401; Burdick, D.M., Buchsbaum, R., Holt, E., Variation in soil salinity associated with expansion of Phragmites australis in salt marshes (2001) Environ Exp Bot, 46, pp. 247-261; Chambers, R.M., Mozder, T.J., Ambrose, J.C., Effects of salinity and sulfide on the distribution of Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora in a tidal saltmarsh (1998) Aquat Bot, 62, pp. 161-169; Chambers, R.M., Meyerson, L.M., Saltonstall, K., Expansion of Phragmites australis into tidal wetlands of North America (1999) Aquat Bot, 64, pp. 261-273; Clark, J.S., Late-holocene vegetation and coastal processes at a Long Island tidal marsh (1986) J Ecol, 74, pp. 561-578; Dayton, P.K., Tegner, M.J., Edwards, P.B., Riser, K.L., Temporal and spatial scales of kelp demography: The role of oceanographic climate (1999) Ecol Monogr, 69, pp. 219-250; Dukes, J.S., Mooney, H.A., Does global change increase the success of biological invaders?
