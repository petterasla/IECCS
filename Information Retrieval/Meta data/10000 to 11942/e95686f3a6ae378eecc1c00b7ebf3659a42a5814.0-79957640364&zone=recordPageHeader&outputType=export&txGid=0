Most of the papers in this special issue of Climatic Change were developed from presentations at a symposium held at Archbold Biological Station in January 2010, sponsored by the Florida Institute for Conservation Science. Symposium participants agreed that adaptation to sea level rise for the benefit of human communities should be planned in concert with adaptation to reduce vulnerability and impacts to natural communities and native species. The papers in this special issue discuss both of these categories of impacts and adaptation options. In this introductory paper, I place the subject in context by noting that that the literature in conservation biology related to climate change has been concerned largely about increasing temperatures and reduced moisture availability, rather than about sea level rise. The latter, however, is the most immediate and among the most severe impacts of global warming in low-lying regions such as Florida. I then review the content of this special issue by summarizing and interpreting the following 10 papers. I conclude with a review of the recommendations for research and policy that were developed from group discussions at the Archbold symposium. The main lesson that emerges from this volume is that sea level rise, combined with human population growth, urban development in coastal areas, and landscape fragmentation, poses an enormous threat to human and natural well-being in Florida. How Floridians respond to sea level rise will offer lessons, for better or worse, for other low-lying regions worldwide. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climatic changes; Coastal area; Conservation biology; Conservation science; Deep blue; Florida; Group discussions; Human communities; Human population growth; Impacts and adaptation; Landscape fragmentation; Low-lying regions; Native species; Potential impacts; Sea level rise; Urban development; Coastal zones; Conservation; Global warming; Population statistics; Supercomputers; Sea level; adaptive management; climate effect; deep sea; global warming; moisture; population growth; sea level change; temperature anomaly; vulnerability; Florida [United States]; United States",,,,,,"Alexander, T.R., Plant succession on Key Largo, Florida, involving Pinus caribaea and Quercus virginiana (1953) Q J Fla Acad Sci, 16, pp. 133-138; Alexander, T.R., Evidence of recent sea-level rise derived from ecological studies on Key Largo, Florida (1974) Environments of South Florida: Present and past, pp. 61-72. , P.
