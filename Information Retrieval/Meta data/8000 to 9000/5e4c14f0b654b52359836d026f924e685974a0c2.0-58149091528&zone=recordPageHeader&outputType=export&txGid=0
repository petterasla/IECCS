The experimental field was equally divided into six plots for two different treatments: One was a conventional rice field (CK) and the other was a rice-duck ecosystem (RD). With the same amount of urea applied as basal fertilization, N2O emission fluxes from RD and CK followed a similar seasonal variation trend. During the flooding seasons, the N2O emission flux was not correlated with temperature, but it was significantly related to soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN) (p &lt; 0.01) and soil pH (p &lt; 0.01). After drainage, the N2O emission flux was not correlated with temperature, SIN, and soil pH. Our experimental data showed that peaks of N 2O emission flux occurred both in 2 weeks after urea application and after drainage. Compared to CK, RD could significantly increase N2O emission. We evaluated the integrated global warming potentials (GWPs) of a rice-duck cultivation system based on methane (CH4) and N 2O emission, which showed that RD could suppress the total amount of CH4 and N2O emissions from rice paddies. Moreover, because the decrease of CH4 emissions from RD compared to CK was far more than the increase of N2O emissions from RD compared to CK, RD greatly reduced integrated GWPs (CH4 + N2O) compared to CK. So, the rice-duck cultivation system is an effective strategy for reducing integrated GWPs of the rice-duck cultivation systems based on CH4 and N2O in southern China and will contribute to alleviating global warming. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"nitrous oxide; urea; cultivation; emission; emission control; farming system; fertilizer application; global warming; growing season; growth response; inorganic nitrogen; nitrous oxide; rice; seasonal variation; subtropical region; waterfowl; wetland; article; China; constructed wetland; cultivated land; gas transport; greenhouse effect; priority journal; rice; seasonal variation; soil property; soil temperature; Air Pollutants; Animals; China; Crops, Agricultural; Ducks; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza sativa; Wetlands; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,"nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; urea, 57-13-6; Air Pollutants; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Abou Seada, M.N.I., Ottow, J.C.G., Effect of increasing oxygen concentration on total denitrification and nitrous oxide release from soil by different bacteria (1985) Biol Fertil Soils, 1, pp. 31-38; Barnard, R., Leadley, P.W., Hungate, B.A., Global change, nitrification, and denitrification: A review (2005) Global Biogeochem Cycl, 19, p. 1007; Bhatia, A., Pathak, H., Jain., N., Singh, P.K., Singh, A.K., Global warming potential of manure amended soils under rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic plains (2005) Atmos Environ, 39, pp. 6976-6984; Bollmann, A., Conrad, R., Influence of O2 availability on NO and N2O release by nitrification and denitrification in soils (1998) Global Change Biol, 4, pp. 387-396. , 4; Booth, M.S., Stark, J.M., Rastetter, E., Controls on nitrogen cycling in terrestrial cultivation systems: A synthetic analysis of literature data (2005) Ecol Monogr, 75, pp. 139-157; Bronson, K.F., Neue, H.U., Singh, U., Abao, E.B.J., Automated chamber measurement of methane and nitrous oxide flux in a flooded rice soil: I (1997) Residue, Nitrogen, and Water Management.
