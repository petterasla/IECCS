Box 21628, Juneau, AK, United States","This paper revisits 3 broad predictions about forestry's future presented by the author in 1993: the growing importance of products that come from forests, forests increasingly valued for more than the sum of their products and uses, and better appreciation of forests as complex ecological systems controlled by forces larger than humans. These predictions have played out in more dramatic ways than initially envisioned, driven in part by 3 emergent forces: the energy crisis, the ascension of new economic superpowers, and climate change. Examples of these trends and relationships are examined from Canadian and United States contexts.","Ecosystem services; Forest biofuels; Forest management trends; Forests and climate change; Forests and global warming; Sustainable forestry","Ecosystem services; Forest biofuels; Forest management trends; Forests and climate change; Forests and global warming; Sustainable forestry; Biofuels; Ecosystems; Energy policy; Forecasting; Global warming; Timber; Forestry; biofuel; ecosystem service; forest management; global warming; nature-society relations; sustainable forestry; Climates; Ecosystems; Forecasts; Forest Management; Forestry; Forests",,,,,,"(2008) Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative 2007/08-2009/10 Strategic Plan, , http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hts/Future_Forests/, British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range; Costanza, R., D'Arge, R., De Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Limburg, K., Van Den Belt, M., The value of the worlds ecosystem services and natural capital (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 253-260; Hickman, C., (2007) TIMOs and REITs, , www.timbertax.org/publications/FS/TIMO_REIT_Paper_PDC.pdf; Lippke, B., Edmonds, L., Environmental performance improvement in residential construction: The impact of products, biofuels, and processes (2006) Forest Products Journal, 56 (10), pp. 58-63; Luyssaert, S., Schulze, E.D., Borner, A., Knohl, A., Hessenmöller, D., Law, B.E., Ciais, P., Grace, J., Old-growth forests as global carbon sinks (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 213-215; Malmsheimer, R.W., Heffernan, P., Brink, S., Crandall, D., Deneke, F., Galik, C., Gee, E., Steward, J., Forest management solutions for mitigating climate change in the United States (2008) Journal of Forestry, 106 (3), pp. 115-171; McElroy, A.K., Fuels for schools and beyond (2007) Biomass Magazine, , http://www.biomassmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=1230, April 2007; Phillips, S., Silverman, R., Gore, A., (2008) Greater Than Zero: Toward the Total Economic Value of Alaska's National Forest Wildlands, , The Wilderness Society, Washington, DC; (2007) Greenhouse Gas Impacts of Expanded Renewable and Alternative Fuels Use, , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
