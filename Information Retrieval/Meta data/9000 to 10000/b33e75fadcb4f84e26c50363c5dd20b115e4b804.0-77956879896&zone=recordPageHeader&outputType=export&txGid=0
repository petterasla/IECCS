Global warming is expected to trigger vegetation changes and water table drawdown in boreal peatlands, such changes have only been investigated on isoprene emission but never on other BVOCs. We aimed at distinguishing the BVOCs released from vascular plants, mosses and peat in hummocks (dry microsites) and hollows (wet microsites) of boreal peatland microcosms maintained in growth chambers. We also assessed the effect of water table drawdown (-20. cm) on the BVOC emissions in hollow microcosms. BVOC emissions were measured from peat samples underneath the moss surface after the 7-week-long experiment to investigate whether the potential effects of vegetation and water table drawdown were shown. BVOCs were sampled using a conventional chamber method, collected on adsorbent and analyzed with GC-MS. In hummock microcosms, vascular plants increased the monoterpene emissions compared with the treatment where all above-ground vegetation was removed while no effect was detected on the sesquiterpenes, other reactive VOCs (ORVOCs) and other VOCs. Peat layer from underneath the surface with intact vegetation had the highest sesquiterpene emissions. In hollow microcosms, intact vegetation had the highest sesquiterpene emissions. Water table drawdown decreased monoterpene and other VOC emissions. Specific compounds could be closely associated to the natural/lowered water tables. Peat layer from underneath the surface of hollows with intact vegetation had the highest emissions of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and ORVOCs whereas water table drawdown decreased those emissions. The results suggest that global warming would change the BVOC emission mixtures from boreal peatlands following changes in vegetation composition and water table drawdown. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Mire; Monoterpene; Peat; Sesquiterpene; Sphagnum","Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Boreal peatland microcosms; Boreal peatlands; Effect of water; Ground vegetation; Growth chamber; Isoprene emission; Microsites; Mire; Monoterpene; Monoterpene emissions; Monoterpenes; Peat samples; Potential effects; Sesquiterpenes; Sphagnum; Vascular plant; Vegetation change; Vegetation composition; VOC emissions; Water table drawdown; Water tables; Adsorption; Aquifers; Atmospheric chemistry; Global warming; Methane; Olefins; Peat; Volatile organic compounds; Water levels; Wetlands; Vegetation; adsorbent; biogenic volatile organic compound; organic compound; other reactive volatile organic compound; peat; sesquiterpene; terpene; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; global warming; hydrological change; isoprene; microcosm; mire; moss; peatland; terpene; vascular plant; vegetation dynamics; volatile organic compound; water table; article; chemical analysis; climate change; controlled study; dry deposition; field emission; greenhouse effect; growth chamber; mass fragmentography; microcosm; moss; nonhuman; peatland; priority journal; surface property; vascular plant; vegetation; waste component removal; water table; water table drawdown; water table management; wet deposition; Bryophyta; Sphagnum; Tracheophyta",,,,,,"Asensio, D., Peñuelas, J., Ogaya, R., Llusià, J., Seasonal soil VOC exchange rates in a Mediterranean holm oak forest and their responses to drought conditions (2007) Atmospheric Environment, 41, pp. 2456-2466; Beckmann, M., Lloyd, D., Extraction and identification of volatile organic substances (VOS) from Scottish peat cores (2001) Atmospheric Environment, 35, pp. 79-86; Chen, F., Al-Ahmad, H., Joyce, B., Zhao, N., Köllner, T.G., Degenhardt, J., Stewart, C.N., Within-plant distribution and emission of sesquiterpenes from Copaifera officinalis (2009) Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 47, pp. 1017-1023; Faubert, P., Tiiva, P., Rinnan, Å., Michelsen, A., Holopainen, J.K., Rinnan, R., Doubled volatile organic compound emissions from subarctic tundra under simulated climate warming (2010) New Phytologist, 187, pp. 199-208; Gorham, E., Northern peatlands: role in the carbon cycle and probable responses to climatic warming (1991) Ecological Applications, 1, pp. 182-195; Guenther, A., Hewitt, C.N., Erickson, D., Fall, R., Geron, C., Graedel, T., Harley, P., Zimmerman, P., A global model of natural volatile organic compound emissions (1995) Journal of Geophysical Research, 100, pp. 8873-8892; Haapanala, S., Rinne, J., Pystynen, K.-H., Hellén, H., Hakola, H., Riutta, T., Measurements of hydrocarbon emissions from a boreal fen using the REA technique (2006) Biogeosciences, 3, pp. 103-112; Helmig, D., Klinger, L.F., Guenther, A., Vierling, L., Geron, C., Zimmerman, P., Biogenic volatile organic compound emissions (BVOCs) I.
