While these schemes were designed as economic instruments to support the vehicle production industry, governments have also claimed that these programs have environmental benefits such as reducing CO2 emissions by bringing more fuel-efficient vehicles onto the roads. However, little evidence is available to support this claim as current energy and environmental accounting models are inadequate for comprehensively capturing the economic and environmental trade-offs associated with changes in product life and product use. We therefore developed a new dynamic model to quantify the carbon emissions due to changes in product life and consumer behavior related to product use. Based on a case study of Japanese vehicle use during the 1990-2000 period, we found that extending, not shortening, the lifetime of a vehicle helps to reduce life-cycle CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain. Empirical results also revealed that even if the fuel economy of less fuel-efficient ordinary passenger vehicles were improved to levels comparable with those of the best available technology, i.e. hybrid passenger cars currently being produced in Japan, total CO2 emissions would decrease by only 0.2%. On the other hand, we also find that extending the lifetime of a vehicle contributed to a moderate increase in emissions of health-relevant air pollutants (NOx, HC, and CO) during the use phase. From the results, this study concludes that the effects of global warming and air pollution can be somewhat moderated and that these problems can be addressed through specific policy instruments directed at increasing the market for hybrid cars as well as extending lifetime of automobiles, which is contrary to the current wisdom. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollutants; Best available technologies; Carbon emissions; Climate change policies; Consumer behaviors; Current energy; Economic instruments; Empirical results; Environmental benefits; Fuel-efficient vehicles; Global economics; Hybrid cars; Lifetime extension; Motor vehicle; Passenger vehicles; Policy instruments; Product life; Production industries; Replacement scheme; Use Phase; Air quality; Automobiles; Fuel economy; Fuels; Global warming; Pollution; Supply chains; Vehicles; carbon dioxide; fuel; air pollutant; exhaust gas; atmospheric pollution; automobile; carbon emission; climate change; economic impact; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; governance approach; trade-off; air pollutant; air pollution; article; climate change; dynamics; economic aspect; environmental impact; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; human; life cycle; lifespan; motor vehicle; policy; technology; commercial phenomena; consumer; decision making; economics; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; United Kingdom; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Choice Behavior; Commerce; Consumer Participation; Global Warming; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Air Pollutants; Vehicle Emissions",,,,"(2009) Vehicle Scrapping Schemes in the European Union, , http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20090406_Scrapping_schemes.pdf, European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
