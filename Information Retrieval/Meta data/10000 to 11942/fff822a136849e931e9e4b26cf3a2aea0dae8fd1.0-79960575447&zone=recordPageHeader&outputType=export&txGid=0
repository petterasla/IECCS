However, the effects of multiple environmental factors - as components of global climate change - on aerobic CH4 emissions have been little studied. We examined the combined effects of temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2) and watering regime on CH4 emissions from six commonly cultivated crop species: faba bean, sunflower, pea, canola, barley and wheat. Plants were grown from seeds in controlled-environment growth chambers under two temperature regimes (24°C day/20°C night and 30°C day/26°C night), two CO2 concentrations (380 and 760μmolmol-1) and two watering regimes (well watered and water stressed). Plants were grown first under 24/20°C for 1 week from sowing, and then placed under experimental conditions for a further week. After the specified time, plant growth, gas exchange and CH4 emission rates were determined. Our results revealed that higher temperature and water stress significantly enhance CH4 emissions from plants, whereas elevated CO2 had the opposite effect and partially reverses the promotive effects of these factors. We suggest that the despite the mitigating effects of rising atmospheric CO2, CH4 emission may be higher in the face of ongoing global climate change in warmer and drier environments. © CSIRO 2011.","aerobic methane emission; gas exchange; global climate change; high temperature; plant growth; water stress","Brassica napus var. napus; Helianthus; Hordeum; Pisum sativum; Triticum aestivum; Vicia faba",,,,,"NSERC, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","Ainsworth, E.A., Rogers, A., The response of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to rising[CO2]: Mechanisms and environmental interactions (2007) Plant, Cell & Environment, 30, pp. 258-270; Allen, L.H., Jr., Albrecht, S.L., Colón-Guasp, W., Covell, S.A., Baker, J.T., Pan, D., Boote, K.J., Methane emissions of rice increased by elevated carbon dioxide and temperature (2003) Journal of Environmental Quality, 32, pp. 1978-1991; Beerling, D.J., Gardiner, T., Leggett, G., McLeod, A., Quick, W.P., Missing methane emissions from leaves of terrestrial plants (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 1821-1826; Bernacchi, C.J., Kimball, B.A., Quarles, D.R., Long, S.P., Ort, D.R., Decreases in stomatal conductance of soybean under open-air elevation of [CO2] are closely coupled with decreases in ecosystem evapotranspiration (2007) Plant Physiology, 143, pp. 134-144; Braga Do-Carmo, J., Keller, M., Dezincourt Dias, J., Barbosa De-Camargo, P., Crill, P., Asource of methane from upland forests in the Brazilian Amazon (2006) Geophysical Research Letters, 33, p.
