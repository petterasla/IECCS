In this study, the effects of land-use type (forest vs. grassland) and temperature (10 vs. 15°C) on gross N transformation rates under aerobic conditions were investigated using the 15N isotope pool dilution technique in the laboratory. Soils were collected from forest and grassland sites in China and Canada. The results showed that gross N mineralization and immobilization rates were significantly higher in forest soils than in grassland soils, while the reverse was true for gross nitrification rates. The higher TC and lower SOCw concentrations in the Chinese soils relative to the Canadian soils were related to the greater gross N mineralization rates and lower gross N immobilization rates in Chinese soils. The greater gross N mineralization rates and lower gross N immobilization rates resulted in much higher inorganic N accumulation and that may increase the risk of NO3 - leaching in the Chinese soils. Increasing temperature significantly increased gross nitrification rates in grassland soils and gross N immobilization rates in forest soils, suggesting that grassland soils maybe more vulnerable to N loss through NO3 - leaching or denitrification (when conditions for denitrification exist) and that conversion of grassland to forest soils may exert less negative effects on the environment by promoting the retention of N and decreasing the production of NO3 - and subsequently the risk of NO3 - leaching under increasing temperature by global warming. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","15N dilution technique; Immobilization; Land-use type; Mineralization; Nitrification; Temperature","biotransformation; forest soil; global warming; grassland; immobilization; land use; leaching; mineralization; nitrification; nitrogen isotope; soil nitrogen; temperature effect; Canada; China",,,,,,"Accoe, F., Boeckx, P., Busschaert, J., Gross N transformation rates and net N mineralization rates related to the C and N contents of soil organic matter fractions in grassland soils of different age (2004) Soil Biol Biochem, 36, pp. 2075-2087; Accoe, F., Boeckx, P., Videla, X., Estimation of gross nitrogen transformations and nitrogen retention in grassland soils using Fluaz (2005) Soil Biol Biochem, 69, pp. 1967-1976; Andersen, M.K., Jensen, L.S., Low soil temperature effects on short-term gross N mineralization-immobilization turnover after incorporation of a green manure (2001) Soil Biol Biochem, 33, pp. 511-521; Bååth, E., Anderson, T.H., Comparison of soil fungal/bacterial ratios in a pH gradient using physiological and PLFA-based techniques (2003) Soil Biol Biochem, 35, pp. 955-963; Booth, M.S., Stark, J.M., Rastetter, E., Controls on nitrogen cycling in terrestrial ecosystems: a synthetic analysis of literature data (2005) Ecol Monogr, 75, pp. 139-157; Bremner, J.M., Nitrogen-total (1996) Methods of Soil Analysis.
