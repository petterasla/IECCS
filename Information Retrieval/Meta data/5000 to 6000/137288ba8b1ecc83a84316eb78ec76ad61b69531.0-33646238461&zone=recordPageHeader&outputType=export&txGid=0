The study was carried out in three forest stands of different age, young (30-40 years), middle aged (50-70 years), and old (150-200 years). One hundred soil samples were collected within each sampling site once a year in autumn over a period of 11 years. In total, 66 species of Collembola were found. Species richness varied between 47 and 56 and density of Collembola from 7300 to 8300 ind m-2. A statistically significant increase in the sums of positive air temperatures ({greater than or slanted equal to}4 °C) was recorded during the period of investigation. Precipitation and thereby soil moisture showed considerable year-to-year fluctuations. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling of the data yielded two axes explaining 48.6% and 38.6% of the variation. Axis 1 coincided with the trend of sums of positive air temperature ( r = 0.66). Axis 1 corresponded best with the negative impact of warming of climate on Collembola, mainly on the euedaphic species inhabiting the deeper layers of the organic soil horizon. Axis 2 was considered reflecting the effect of soil moisture fluctuations (correlation with moisture r = - 0.62) on litter dwelling, mostly hemiedaphic Collembola. Species richness tended to decrease gradually in all forest sites during the study period from 29-36 to 13-26 species. Correlation between axes ( r = 0.455) indicated interaction effects between positive air temperatures and soil moisture. Forest age showed no substantial effect on the community structure, therefore the changes observed cannot be explained by ecological succession. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.
