Because typhoons are the major triggers of shallow landslides in Taiwan, landslide activity is expected to increase as global warming continues. To assess the worst scenario of landslide occurrence in a mountainous watershed till the end of the century, this study developed a method to select a global climate model (GCM) from 21 available GCMs and correct its monthly precipitation data, before downscaling annual maximum (24-h) rainfall from the corrected GCM data as input to the factor-of-safety model for landslide prediction. Average annual maximum rainfall is expected to increase from 322. mm in 1960-2008 to 371. mm in 2010-2099. Average total unstable area is expected to increase from 1135. ha in 1960-2008 to 1280. ha in 2010-2099, a 12% increase. As a first attempt to assess landslide activity due to global warming, this study is useful as a reference for watershed management in Taiwan. The results must be evaluated in light of uncertainties caused by the correction and downscaling of GCM data and the input parameters to the slope stability model. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Data correction; Extreme rainfall events; GCM; Taiwan; Typhoon-triggered landslides","climate change; downscaling; global climate; global warming; landslide; rainfall; slope stability; tropical cyclone; typhoon; watershed; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Taiwan",,,,,,"Allan, A.P., Soden, B.J., Atmospheric warming and the amplification of precipitation extremes (2008) Science, 321, pp. 1481-1484; Buma, J., Dehn, M., A method for predicting the impact of climate change on slope stability (1998) Environmental Geology, 35, pp. 190-196; Camargo, S.J., Sobel, A.H., Western northern Pacific tropical cyclone intensity and ENSO (2005) Journal of Climate, 18, pp. 2996-3006; Camargo, S.J., Li, H., Sun, L., Feasibility study for downscaling seasonal tropical cyclone activity using the NCEP regional spectral model (2007) International Journal of Climatology, 27, pp. 311-325; Chan, J.C.L., Liu, K.S., Global warming and western North Pacific typhoon activity from an observational perspective (2004) Journal of Climate, 17, pp. 4590-4602; Chang, K., Chiang, S., An integrated model for predicting rainfall-induced landslides (2009) Geomorphology, 105, pp. 366-373; Chou, C., Huang, L.-F., Tu, J.-Y., Tseng, L., Hsueh, Y.-C., El Niño impacts on precipitation in the western North Pacific-East Asian sector (2009) Journal of Climate, 22, pp. 2039-2057; Collison, A., Wade, S., Griffiths, J., Dehn, M., Modelling the impact of predicted climate change on landslide frequency and magnitude in SE England (2000) Engineering Geology, 55, pp. 205-218; Dehn, M., Buma, J., Modelling future landslide activity based on general circulation models (1999) Geomorphology, 30, pp. 175-187; Dehn, M., Bürger, G., Buma, J., Gasparetto, P., Impact of climate change on slope stability using expanded downscaling (2000) Engineering Geology, 55, pp. 193-204; Déqué, M., Frequency of precipitation and temperature extremes over France in an anthropogenic scenario: model results and statistical correction according to observed values (2007) Global and Planetary Change, 57, pp. 16-26; Dikau, R., Schrott, L., The temporal stability and activity of landslides in Europe with respect to climate change (TESLEC): main objectives and results (1999) Geomorphology, 30, pp. 1-12; Dixon, N., Brook, E., Impact of predicted climate change on landslide reactivation: case study of Mam Tor, UK (2007) Landslides, 4, pp. 137-147; Elsner, J.B., Kossin, J.P., Jagger, T.H., The increasing intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 92-95; Emanuel, K., Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30years (2005) Nature, 436, pp. 686-688; Feser, F., von Storch, H., A dynamical downscaling case study for typhoons in SE Asia using a regional climate model (2008) Monthly Weather Review, 136, pp. 1806-1815; Feser, F., von Storch, H., Regional modeling of the western Pacific typhoon season 2004 (2008) Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 17, pp. 519-528; Hoyos, C.D., Agudelo, P.A., Webster, P.J., Curry, J.A., Deconvolution of the factors contributing to the increase in global hurricane intensity (2006) Science, 312, pp. 94-97; Huang, J.C., Kao, S.J., Optimal estimator for measuring landslide model efficiency (2006) Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 10, pp. 957-965; Huang, J.C., Kao, S.J., Hsu, M.L., Lin, J.C., Stochastic procedure to extract and to integrate landslide susceptibility maps: an example of mountainous watershed in Taiwan (2006) Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 6, pp. 803-815; Climate Change 2007: the physical science basis (2007) Fourth Assessment Report, p. 996. , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, S.
