A combination of reduced national forest timber harvesting and aggressive fire prevention has resulted in large build up of fuels. Changes in the tree species planted or regenerated following a harvest is the best option for reducing wild fire risks due to climate change patterns. A likely impact of climate change has extended the growing season and as a result has increased bug season. Early detection, removal, and burning of infested trees in outbreak areas, restricting transport of infested wood and wood products, aerial spraying, and use of pheromones are helpful in controlling insect damage. The use of down slope brush barriers, buffer strips, culverts and bridge mats ate stream crossings, and broad based dips reduce climate change impacts.",,"Hexapoda",,,,,,,"McNulty, S.; USDA Forest Service, Southern Global Change ProgramUnited States",,,,,,,,10879110,,,,"English","Forest Landowner",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650733048
