Large inter-annual variability of rainfall and river flow in coastal Queensland is linked to the aperiodic influences of El Niño-Southern Oscillation events. These events also affect sea surface temperature and wind fields, though the inter-annual variability of these variables is not as large as rainfall and river flow. The major impacts on waters of the GBR appear to be greatly increased freshwater inputs, reduced surface radiation (and thus light levels) and enhanced tropical cyclone activity during anti-El Niño events. El Niño events have less effect on climate of the GBR because they tend to maintain winter-like conditions. The effects of this background of high variability in the physical environment on reef processes must be considered when examining changes in such processes, changes in climate (e.g. due to global warming) or increases in anthropogenic impacts. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",,"climate 1958-1987; climate variability; climate variation; El Nino/Southern Oscillation; ENSO; Coral Sea, Great Barrier Reef",,,,,,"Allan, R.B., El Niño Southern Oscillation influences in the Australasian region (1988) Prog Phys Geogr, 12, pp. 313-348; Allan, R.B., Pariwono, J.I., Ocean-atmosphere interactions in low-latitude Australia (1990) Int J Climatol, 10, pp. 145-178; Andrews, J.C., Pickard, G.L., The physical oceanography of coral-reef systems (1990) Coral reefs ecosystems of the world 25, pp. 11-48. , Z., Dubinsky, Elsevier, Amsterdam; Bate, P., The Australian tropical cyclone season 1982–83 (1983) Aust Meteorol Mag, 31, pp. 209-216; Brandon, D.E., Waters of the Great Barrier Reef Province (1973) Biology and geology of coral reefs, vol. 1: geology 1., pp. 187-232. , O.A., Jones, R., Endean, Academic Press, New York London; HF, (1992) El Niño.
