The model uses Holocene tree migration rates to approximate maximum migration rates in a forested landscape. Habitat availability and local population size was varied systematically under two dispersal and colonization models. These dispersal models varied in the likelihood of long-distance dispersal events. The first model used a negative exponential function that severely limited the probability of long-distance dispersal. The results of this model indicate that migration rate could decline an order of magnitude where the habitat availability is reduced from 80 to 20% of the matrix. The second model, using an inverse power function, carried a higher probability of long-distance dispersal events. The results from this model predict relatively small declines in migration rates when habitat availability is reduced to 50% of the simulation matrix. Below 50% habitat availability, mean migration rate was similar to the negative exponential model. These results predict a failure of many trees to respond to future climatic change through range expansion. © 1993 Chapman & Hall.","deforestation; global warming; Holocene; simulation model; tree migration",,,,,,,"Alverson, W.S., Waller, D.M., Solheim, S.L., Forests too deer: edge effects in northern Wisconsin (1988) Conservation Biology, 2, pp. 348-58; Anderson, R.C., Loucks, O.L., White-tail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) influence on structure and composition of Tsuga canadensis forests (1979) J.
