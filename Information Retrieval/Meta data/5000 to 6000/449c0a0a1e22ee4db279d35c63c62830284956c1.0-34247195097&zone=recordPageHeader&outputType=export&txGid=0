The elicitation sought to examine the range of opinions within the climatic research community about the physical processes that determine the current strength of the AMOC, its future evolution in a changing climate and the consequences of potential AMOC changes. Experts assign different relative importance to physical processes which determine the present-day strength of the AMOC as well as to forcing factors which determine its future evolution under climate change. Many processes and factors deemed important are assessed as poorly known and insufficiently represented in state-of-the-art climate models. All experts anticipate a weakening of the AMOC under scenarios of increase of greenhouse gas concentrations. Two experts expect a permanent collapse of the AMOC as the most likely response under a 4×CO2 scenario. Assuming a global mean temperature increase in the year 2100 of 4 K, eight experts assess the probability of triggering an AMOC collapse as significantly different from zero, three of them as larger than 40%. Elicited consequences of AMOC reduction include strong changes in temperature, precipitation distribution and sea level in the North Atlantic area. It is expected that an appropriately designed research program, with emphasis on long-term observations and coupled climate modeling, would contribute to substantially reduce uncertainty about the future evolution of the AMOC. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Coastal zones; Earth atmosphere; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Probability; Thermal effects; Climate models; North Atlantic; State-of-the-art; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; global climate; greenhouse gas; meridional circulation; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",,,,,,"Broecker, W., The great ocean conveyor (1991) Oceanograhy, 4, pp. 79-89; Bryden, H.L., Longworth, H.R., Cunningham, S.A., Slowing of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation at 25°N (2005) Nature, 438, pp. 655-657. , doi:10.1038/nature04385; Budnitz, R.J., Apostolakis, G., Boore, D.M., Cluff, L.S., Coppersmith, K.J., Cornell, C.A., Morris, P.A., Use of technical expert panels: Applications to probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (1995) Risk Analysis, 18 (4), pp. 463-469; Curry, R., Dickson, B., Yashayaev, I., A change in the freshwater balance of the Atlantic Ocean over the past four decades (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 826-829; Curry, R., Mauritzen, C., Dilution of the northern North Atlantic Ocean in recent decades (2005) Science, 308, pp. 1772-1774; Dalkey, N.C., The use of self-ratings to improve group estimates (1969) Technol Forecast, 12, pp. 283-229; Dansgaard, W., Johnsen, S.J., Clausen, H.B., Dahl-Jensen, N.S., Gundestrup, N.S., Hammer, C.U., Hvidberg, C.S., Bond, G., Evidence for general instability of past climate from a 250-kyr ice-core record (1993) Nature, 364, pp. 218-220; Dawes, R.M., (1988) Rational choice in an uncertain world, , Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Orlando, FL; Dickson, B., Yashayaev, I., Meincke, J., Turrell, B., Dye, S., Holfort, J., Rapid freshening of the deep North Atlantic Ocean over the past four decades (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 832-837; Dickson, R.R., Lazier, J., Meincke, J., Rhines, P., Swift, J., Long-term coordinated changes in the convective activity of the North Atlantic (1996) Prog Oceanogr, 38, pp. 241-295; Ganachaud, A., Wunsch, C., Improved estimates of global ocean circulation, heat transport and mixing from hydrographic data (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 453-457; Goosse, H., Renssen, H., Selten, F.M., Haarsma, R.J., Opsteegh, J.D., Potential causes of abrupt climate events: A numerical study with a three-dimensional climate model (2002) Geophys Res Lett, 29 (18), p. 1860. , doi:10.1029/2002GL014993; Gregory, J., Dixon, K., Stouffer, R., Weaver, A., Driesschaert, E., Eby, M., Fichefet, T., Thorpe, R., A model intercomparison of changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, pp. L12703.1-L12703.5. , doi:10.1029/2005GL023209; Gregory, J., Huybrechts, P., Raper, S., Threatened loss of theGreenland ice-sheet (2004) Nature, 428, p. 616; Häkkinen, S., Rhines, P., Decline of subpolar North Atlantic circulation during the 1990s (2004) Science, 304, pp. 555-559; Hátún, H., Sandø, A.B., Drange, H., Hansen, B., Valdimarsson, H., Influence of the Atlantic subpolar gyre on the thermohaline circulation (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1841-1844; Climate change 2001: Scientific basis (2001) Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report, , Houghton J, Ding Y, Griggs D, Noguer M, van der Linden P, Dai X, Maskell K, Johnson C eds, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
