"Sheffield J.","World population and energy demand growth: The potential role of fusion energy in an efficient world",1999,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","357","1752",,"377","395",,,,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0347600498&partnerID=40&md5=d4f851f084a73cf71331d7eddd4fac3e",,"Sheffield, J.","The fertility rate for women and the related population growth rate for numerous developing (transitional) countries show a downward trend with increasing annual per capita energy use. On the assumption that such trends will continue, estimates are made for some simple cases of the energy demands required to stabilize the world's population in the period 2100-2150. An assessment is made of how these energy demands might be met, capitalizing as much as possible on the indigenous energy resources for each of the ten major regions of the world: North America, Latin America, Europe OECD, Former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, China, Pacific OECD, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Consideration is also given to the potential need to limit carbon emissions because of global-warming concerns. The study highlights the crucial nature of energy-efficiency improvements and the need to use all energy sources if the world is to find a sustainable future with a much improved standard of living in the developing world. While, globally, there are huge resources of fossil fuels, they are unevenly distributed and some of the areas experiencing major population growth are not well endowed with them. Even allowing for the substantial deployment of renewable energies (biomass, geothermal, hydro-, tide, wave and wind power), if fossil-fuel use is restricted or has limited availability, there will be a need in a number of regions (e.g. South Asia) for substantial amounts of nuclear and solar energy to meet their long-term needs. The deployment of more fission power can build upon the existing successes. The availability of fusion power will depend upon the pace of the development program and, in principle, fusion-power deployment might start around the middle of the 21st century. Example scenarios of possible contributions of the various energy sources are described, to illustrate the potential roles for fission and fusion power.","Annual energy per capita; Energy demand; Mass efficiency; Nuclear fusion; Population growth",,,,,,,"(1997) Atlas Project: Summary Findings.
