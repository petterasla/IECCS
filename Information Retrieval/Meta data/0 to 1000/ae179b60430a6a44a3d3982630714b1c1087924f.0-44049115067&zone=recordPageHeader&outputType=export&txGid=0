There is no doubt that this process leads to global climate change, although the quantitative and regional patterns of this change are not exactly known. Moreover, this process is in competition with natural climate fluctuations. This brief paper summarizes the climate model projections of anthropogenic climate change (enhanced 'greenhouse effect') and discusses some aspects of observational climatic data. © 1992.","atmosphere; carbon dioxide; Climate; greenhouse effect; temperature",,,,,,,"Cubasch, Modelling of the anthropogenically caused climate changes with coupled ocean-atmosphere models (1991) Global Change Prisma, 2, pp. 7-9; (1991) Report No. 67, , See also, Max-Planck-Institut für Meteorologie, Hamburg, FRG; Diaz, Bradley, Eischeid, Precipitation fluctuations over global land areas since the late 1800's (1989) J.
