Life cycle assessment methods may be used to evaluate the life cycle carbon footprint of a product, such as the National Geographic magazine. The results of the study provide the publisher and material suppliers with information to reduce life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The study also informs consumers of the GHG emissions associated with the product. The purpose of this study was to document the life cycle carbon footprint of the National Geographic magazine. Methods Currently, there is no international standard for conducting a product life cycle carbon footprint. Both the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the World Resources Institute's Greenhouse Gas Protocol are working to develop standards. The study followed the ISO standards for life cycle assessment (ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard also provided guidance. Results The study showed that the life cycle of the National Geographic magazine produces about 0.82 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents per life cycle of the average magazine. The amount of GHG emissions per life cycle of each magazine produced is about the same amount of GHG emissions produced by driving an automobile (8.5 km/liter gasoline) for about 3 km. Discussion High quality, geographically and temporally representative data for the study were provided by National Geographic, Verso Paper, and Quad Graphics. These data are specific to the magazine life cycle and account for about 88% of the total energy results and about 75% of the total GHG emissions for the entire life cycle of the magazine. The study includes extraction of raw materials from the earth, processing of raw materials, fuels, intermediate products, transportation steps, manufacture of paper, printing, distribution of the magazine, and final disposition. Conclusions The results indicate that opportunities for improving the carbon footprint of the magazine are more likely to be found within the manufacturing and printing of the paper. These two steps account for the majority of the greenhouse gas emissions. Including recycled fiber into magazine paper did not improve the carbon footprint of the magazine. Incorporation of groundwood did impact end-oflife emissions from disposal into landfills. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Globalwarming potential; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle; Magazines","carbon dioxide; air pollution control; article; carbon dioxide measurement; combustion; energy resource; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; paper industry; priority journal; process development; publication; quality control; quantitative analysis; scientific literature; standardization; waste disposal",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Achankeng, E., Globalization, urbanization and municipal solid waste management in Africa (2003) African Studies Association of Australasia and the Pacific 2003 Conference Proceedings- African on a Global Stage; (2006) Australia's Environment Issues and Trends, , Australian Bureau of Statistics; Barlaz, M., Biodegradability of municipal solid waste components in laboratory-scale landfills (1997) Environ Sci Technol, 31 (3), pp. 911-917; Bontoux, L., (1999) The Incineration of Waste in Europe: Issues and Perspectives, , Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Seville; Domalski, E.S., Milne, T.A., (1987) Thermodynamic Data for Biomass Materials and Waste Components, , American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New York, Sponsored by the ASME Research Committee on Industrial and Municipal Wastes; (2009) Waste Management, Thermal Treatment, , Environment Canada, April 8; Estevez, P., (2003) Management of Municipal Sold Waste in Santiago, Chile: Assessing Waste-To-Energy Possibilities, , Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, Fu Foundation of School of Engineering and Applied Science, Earth Engineering Center, New York; (2007) European Declaration on Paper Recycling, 2006-2010, , European Recovered Paper Council, Monitoring Report 2007; (2008), http://www.letsrecycle.com/do/ecco.py/view_item?listid=37&listcatid= 217&listitemid=31212, EuroStat.
