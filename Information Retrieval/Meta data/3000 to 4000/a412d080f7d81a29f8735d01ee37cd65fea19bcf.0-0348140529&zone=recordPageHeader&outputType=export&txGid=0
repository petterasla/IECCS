Down core profiles of the n-alkane concentrations and mass accumulation rates (MAR) were characterized by deglacial maxima. In particular, cores PC2 and PC4, which were collected from the central and western Sea of Okhotsk, respectively, show a two-step increase around the Meltwater Pulse events (MWP) 1A (14.5-13.5 kyr BP) and 1B (about 10 kyr BP). This finding was interpreted by the outflow of terrestrial organic matter from the submerged land shelf to the Sea of Okhotsk through the East Sakhalin Current. This study demonstrated that the sea level rise forced by global warming in the deglaciation period may have caused the enhanced transport of terrestrial organic matter in marginal seas.",,"Concentration (process); Glacial geology; Global warming; Sediments; Mass accumulation rates (MAR); Paraffins; alkane; global warming; last deglaciation; organic matter; paleoceanography; Quaternary; sea level change; terrestrial deposit; Sea of Okhotsk",,,,,,"Blanchon, P., Shaw, J., Reef drowning during the last deglaciation: Evidence for catastrophic sea-level rise and ice-sheet collapse (1995) Geology, 23, pp. 4-8; Bray, E.E., Evans, E.D., Distributions of n-paraffins as a clue to recognition of source beds (1961) Geochim.
