To begin to assess the magnitude of this source, we have examined the methane content of permafrost in samples from shallow cores (maximum depth, 9.5 m) at three sites in Fairbanks, Alaska, where discontinuous permafrost is common. These cores sampled frozen loess, peat, and water (ice) below the active layer. Methane contents of permafrost range from &lt; 0.001 to 22.2 mg/kg of sample. The highest methane content of 22.2 mg/kg was found in association with peat at one site. Silty loess had high methane contents at each site of 6.56, 4.24, and 0.152 mg/kg, respectively. Carbon isotopic compositions of the methane (δ13C) ranged from -70.8 to -103.9‰, and hydrogen isotopic compositions of the methane (δD) from -213 to -313‰, indicating that the methane is microbial in origin. The methane concentrations were used in a one dimensional heat conduction model to predict the amount of methane that will be released from permafrost worldwide over the next 100 years, given two climate change scenarios. Our results indicate that at least 30 years will elapse before melting permafrost releases important amounts of methane; a maximum methane release rate will be about 25 to 30 Tg/yr, assuming that methane is generally distributed in shallow permafrost as observed in our samples. © 1993.",,"carbon 13; deuterium; methane; arctic; climate; conference paper; futurology; greenhouse effect; microorganism; thermal conductivity; united states; warming",,"carbon 13, 14762-74-4; deuterium, 7782-39-0; methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Cicerone, Oremland, Biogeochemical aspects of atmospheric methane (1988) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 2, pp. 299-327; Ginsburg, Bordukov, Timkin, Data of gas geochemical sampling of frozen quaternary sediments at the gas fields (1979) Methods of detail prognosis of oil and gas presence, pp. 18-37. , Leningrad; Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) Climate Change—The IPCC Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Khalil, Rasmussen, Constraints on the global sources of methane and an analysis of recent budgets (1990) Tellus, 42 B, pp. 229-236; Kvenvolden, Lorenson, Studies of permafrost and gas hydrates as possible sources of atmospheric methane of high latitudes (1991) Proceedings, 10th International Symposium on Environmental Biogeochemistry, , in press, San Francisco, California; Kvenvolden, Lorenson, Vary amounts of methane in shallow permafrost cores from Alaska (1991) Transactions, American Geophysical Union, 72, p. 162; Kvenvolden, Redden, Hydrocarbon gas in sediment from the shelf, slope, and basin of the Bering Sea (1980) Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 44, pp. 1145-1150; Moraes, Khalil, The role of permafrost in the methane cycle and climate change (1991) Transactions, American Geophysical Union, 77, p. 102; Moraes, F., and M.
