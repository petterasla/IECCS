This article presents a decision support model to deal with integrated solid waste management planning problems at a regional or national level. The model is called EASEWASTE (environmental assessment of solid waste systems and technologies). The model consists of a number of modules (submodels), each describing a process in a real waste management system, and these modules may combine to represent a complete waste management system in a scenario. EASEWASTE generates data on emissions (inventory), which are translated and aggregated into different environmental impact categories, e.g. the global warming, acidification, and toxicity. To facilitate a ""first level"" screening evaluation, default values for process parameters have been provided, wherever possible. The EASEWASTE model for life-cycle-assessment of waste management is described and applied to a case study for illustrative purposes. The case study involving hypothetical but realistic data demonstrates the functionality, usability, and flexibilities of the model. The design and implementation of the software successfully address the substantial challenges in integrating process modeling, life-cycle inventory (LCI), and impact assessment (LCIA) modeling, and optimization into an interactive decision support platform. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","EASEWASTE model; Environmental assessment; Life cycle assessment; Modeling; Sensitivity analysis; Systems analysis; Waste management; Waste planning; Waste technologies","Air pollution; Chemical reactions; Decision support systems; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Management; Planning; Process engineering; Renewable energy resources; Software design; Solid wastes; Technology; Case studies; Decision support model; Decision supports; Default values; EASEWASTE model; Environmental assessment; Impact Assessment; Integrating processes; Life cycle assessment; Life-cycle inventory; Management modeling; Modeling; National levels; PC-based; Process parameters; Realistic data; Sensitivity analysis; Solid waste management; Sub-models; Systems analysis; Waste management systems; Waste planning; Waste systems; Waste technologies; Waste management",,,,,,"Johnsen, T., Helga, J.B., Helge, S., Guòmundur, B.F., (2002) Guidelines for the use of LCA in the waste management sector, (1537 -01). , Nordtest Project; International Standard Organization: ISO 14040 Environmental Management-Life Cycle Assessment-Principles and framework (1997).
