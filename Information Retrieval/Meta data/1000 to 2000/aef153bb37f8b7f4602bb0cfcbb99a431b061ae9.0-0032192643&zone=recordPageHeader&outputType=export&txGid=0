We made a laboratory investigation to quantify the relative importance of soil moisture and temperature on fluxes of CO2 and CH4 between forest soils and the atmosphere. Forest floor and mineral soil material were collected from a mixed hardwood forest at the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Site (MA) and were incubated in the laboratory under a range of moisture (air-dry to nearly saturated) and temperature conditions (5-25°C). Carbon dioxide emissions increased exponentially with increasing temperature in forest floor material, with emissions reduced at the lowest and highest soil moisture contents. The forest floor Q10 of 2.03 (from 15-25°C) suggests that CO2 emissions were controlled primarily by soil biological activity. Forest floor CO2 emissions were predicted with a multiple polynomial regression model (r2 = 0.88) of temperature and moisture, but the fit predicting mineral soil respiration was 2 weaker (r2 = 0.59). Methane uptake was controlled strongly by soil moisture, with reduced fluxes under conditions of very low or very high soil moisture contents. A multiple polynomial model accurately described CH4 uptake by mineral soil material (r2 = 0.81), but only weakly (r2 = 0.45) predicted uptake by forest floor material. The mineral soil Q10 of 1.11 for CH4 uptake indicates that methane uptake is controlled primarily by physical processes. Our work suggests that inclusion of both moisture and temperature can improve predictions of soil CO2 and CH4 exchanges between soils and the atmosphere. Additionally, global change models need to consider interactions of temperature and moisture in evaluating effects of global climate change on trace gas fluxes.",,"atmosphere; breathing; carbon dioxide; greenhouse gas; methane; moisture; soil; carbon dioxide; forest soil; methane; soil emission; soil moisture; soil temperature",,,,,,"Adamsen, A.P.S., King, G.M., Methane consumption in temperate and subarctic forest soils: Rates, vertical zonation, and responses to water and nitrogen (1993) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 59, pp. 485-490; Bedard, C., Knowles, R., Physiology, biochemistry, and specific inhibitors of CH4, NH+4, and CO oxidation by methanotrophs and nitrifiers (1989) Microbiological Review, 53, pp. 68-84; Bowden, R.D., Castro, M.S., Melillo, J.M., Steudler, P.A., Aber, J.D., Fluxes of greenhouse gases between soils and the atmosphere in a temperate forest following a simulated hurricane blowdown (1993) Biogeochemistry, 21, pp. 61-71; Born, M., Dorr, H., Levin, I., Methane consumption in aerated soils of the temperate zone (1990) Tellus, 42 B, pp. 2-8; Castro, M.S., Melillo, J.M., Steudler, P.A., Chapman, J.W., Soil moisture as a predictor of methane uptake by temperate forest soils (1994) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 24, pp. 1805-1810; Castro, M.S., Steudler, P.A., Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., Bowden, R.D., Factors controlling atmospheric methane consumption by temperate forest soils (1995) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 9, pp. 1-10; Crill, P.M., Seasonal patterns of methane uptake and carbon dioxide release by a temperate woodland soil (1991) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 5, pp. 319-334; Doran, J.W., Mielke, L.N., Power, J.F., Microbial activity as regulated by soil water-filled pore space (1990) Transactions 14th International Congress of Soil Science, pp. 94-99. , 1990; Dorr, H., Munnich, K.O., Annual variation in soil respiration in selected areas of the temperate zone (1987) Tellus, 39 B, pp. 114-121; Fernandez, I.J., Son, Y., Kraske, C.R., Rustad, L.E., David, M.B., Soil carbon dioxide characteristics under different forest types and after harvest (1993) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 57, pp. 1115-1121; Groffman, P.M., Gold, A.J., Simmons, R.C., Nitrate dynamics in riparian forests: Microbial studies (1992) Journal of Environmental Quality, 21, pp. 666-671; Hanson, P.J., Wullschleger, S.D., Bohlman, S.A., Todd, D.E., Seasonal and topographic patterns of forest floor CO2 efflux from an upland oak forest (1993) Tree Physiology, 31, pp. 1-5; Jenkinson, D.S., Adams, D.E., Wild, A., Model estimates of CO2 emissions from soil in response to global warming (1991) Nature, 351, pp. 304-306; Kicklighter, D.W., Melillo, J.M., Peterjohn, W.T., Rastetter, E.B., McGuire, A.D., Steudler, P.A., Aspects of spatial and temporal aggregation in estimating regional carbon dioxide fluxes from temperate forest soils (1994) Journal of Geophysical Research, 99, pp. 1303-1315; Koschorreck, M., Conrad, R., Oxidation of atmospheric methane in soil: Measurements in the field, in soil cores, and in soil samples (1993) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 7, pp. 109-121; Lessard, R., Rochette, P., Topp, E., Pattey, E., Desjardins, R.L., Beaumont, G., Methane and carbon dioxide fluxes from poorly drained adjacent cultivated and forest sites (1994) Canadian Journal of Soil Science, 73, pp. 139-146; Lilieveld, J., Crutzen, P.J., Indirect chemical effects of methane on global warming (1992) Nature, 355, pp. 339-342; Linn, D.M., Doran, J.W., Effect of water-filled pore space on carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide production in tilled and non-tilled soils (1984) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 48, pp. 1267-1272; Lloyd, J., Taylor, J.A., On the temperature dependence of soil respiration (1994) Functional Ecology, 8, pp. 315-323; Magill, A.H., Aber, J.D., Hendricks, J.J., Bowden, R.D., Melillo, J.M., Steudler, P.A., Biogeochemical response of forest ecosystems to simulated chronic nitrogen deposition (1997) Ecological Applications, 7, pp. 402-415; Melillo, J.M., Steudler, P.A., Aber, J.D., Bowden, R.D., Atmospheric deposition and nutrient cycling (1989) Exchange of Trace Gases between Terrestrial Ecosystems and the Atmosphere, pp. 263-280. , eds M.
