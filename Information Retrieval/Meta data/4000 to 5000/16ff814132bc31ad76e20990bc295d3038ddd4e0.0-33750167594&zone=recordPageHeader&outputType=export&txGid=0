To help fill this gap, randomly selected plots were surveyed on the northwestern coast of the Ungava Peninsula, Quebec, Canada, during 2002. Thirty-eight species were recorded at 34 sites, where small songbirds were much more frequent than shorebirds. Breeding waterbirds were more abundant at low elevations near the coast, and songbirds tended to be more abundant at higher elevations. A high occurrence of nesting hawks and owls was probably the result of a high lemming population. Information from the survey extended the known breeding ranges of green-winged teal, spotted sandpiper, pectoral sandpiper, dunlin, American golden-plover, Wilson's snipe, and short-eared owl. Further work on the Ungava Peninsula would likely document additional Arctic-breeding bird species. A more thorough knowledge of Arctic-breeding bird distribution will be needed to determine how species might be affected by global climate change. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Arctic birds; Breeding; Canada; Quebec; Shorebirds; Survey","abundance; breeding; climate change; songbird; surveying; wader; Canada; Canadian Arctic; North America; Quebec [Canada]; Ungava Peninsula; Accipitrinae; Actitis macularia; Anas crecca; Asio flammeus; Aves; Calidris alpina; Calidris melanotos; Passeri; Pluvialis dominica; Strigiformes",,,,,,"(2005) Check-list of North American Birds, , http://www.aou.org/checklist/index.php3, Accessed May 2005; Bart, J.R., Earnst, S., Double sampling to estimate density and population trends in birds (2002) Auk, 119, pp. 36-45; Caccamise, D.F., Reed, L.M., Castelli, P.M., Wainright, S., Nichols, T.C., Distinguishing migratory and resident Canada geese using stable isotope analysis (2000) Journal of Wildlife Management, 64, pp. 1084-1091; Chilton, G., Baker, M.C., Barrentine, C.D., Cunningham, M.A., White-crowned sparrow Zonotrichia leucophrys (1995) The Birds of North America, 183. , Poole, A., and Gill, F., eds.
