This paper presents results from an investigation into potential changes in river flows in 21 catchments in Great Britain, using a daily rainfall runoff model and both equilibrium and transient climate change scenarios. Annual runoff was simulated to increase by 2050 by over 20% in the wettest scenarios and decline by over 20% in the driest scenarios - and different catchments respond differently to the same change scenario. Monthly flows change by a greater percentage than annual flows, and under all the scenarios considered there would be a greater concentration of flow in winter. Snowfall, and hence snowmelt, would be almost entirely eliminated. Progressive changes in river flows over the next few decades would be small compared with year-to-year variability, but would be noticeable on a decade-to-decade basis.",,"Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Rain; Rivers; Runoff; Snow; Catchments; Great Britain; Greenhouse gases; Rainfall runoff model; Snowmelt; Flow of water; rivers; runoff modelling; catchment response; rainfall/runoff model; river flow; seasonal variation; snowmelt; UK",,,,,,"Arnell, N.W., Factors controlling the effects of climate change on river flow regimes in a humid temperate environment (1992) J.
