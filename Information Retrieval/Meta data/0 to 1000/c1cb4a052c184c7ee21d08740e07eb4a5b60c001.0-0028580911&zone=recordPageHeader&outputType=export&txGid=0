Analyses of evolutionary relationships emphasize the uniqueness of certain taxa, help prioritize groups of organisms for conservation, and enable us to estimate the biology of unstudied taxa. Radiotelemetry permits repeated location of stealthy animals, facilitating previously impossible behavioural studies and thus laying the groundwork for effective management. Natural history in a systematic and geographic context provides a ""rule-of-thumb' for predicting extinction due to global climate change. -from Author",,"biodiversity; natural history; systematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00031569,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028580911
