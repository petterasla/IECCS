Population growth, predominantly urban, will occur mainly in developing countries, at a magnitude comparable to creating a city the size of Los Angeles, the second largest city in the United States of America, every three weeks for the next 40 years. Accompanying this growth will be a greatly increased demand for animal protein. How this burgeoning demand can be met by intensive and extensive systems of animal production is discussed, with particular reference to the immensely important role that the veterinary profession and schools must play.","Animal production; Curriculum; Extensive systems; Farming; Food production; Food security; Food supply; Global warming; Intensive farming; Livestock; Para-professionals; Southeast Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; Urbanisation","animal; animal husbandry; article; catering service; education; environment; greenhouse effect; human; meat; needs assessment; nutritional requirement; population growth; standard; veterinary medicine; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Education, Veterinary; Environment; Food Supply; Global Warming; Humans; Meat; Needs Assessment; Nutritional Requirements; Population Growth; Veterinary Medicine; Animalia",,,,,,"Catley A., Leyland T., Mariner J.
