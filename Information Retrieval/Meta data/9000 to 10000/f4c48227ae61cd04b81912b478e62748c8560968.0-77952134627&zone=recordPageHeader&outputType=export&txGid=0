One of the best documented responses to recent climate change is alterations in the migratory behavior of birds, but the mechanisms underlying these phenotypic adjustments are largely unknown. This knowledge is still crucial to predict whether populations of migratory birds will adapt to a rapid increase in temperature. We monitored migratory behavior in a population of blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) to test for evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Using a common garden experiment in time and captive breeding we demonstrated a genetic reduction in migratory activity and evolutionary change in phenotypic plasticity of migration onset. An artificial selection experiment further revealed that residency will rapidly evolve in completely migratory bird populations if selection for shorter migration distance persists. Our findings suggest that current alterations of the environment are favoring birds wintering closer to the breeding grounds and that populations of migratory birds have strongly responded to these changes in selection. The reduction of migratory activity is probably an important evolutionary process in the adaptation of migratory birds to climate change, because it reduces migration costs and facilitates the rapid adjustment to the shifts in the timing of food availability during reproduction.","Adaptation; Bird migration; Climate change; Genetic variation; Natural selection","adaptation; animal experiment; article; biodiversity; bird; breeding; climate change; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; evolution; food availability; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; phenotype; population abundance; population migration; priority journal; reproduction; species distribution; Acclimatization; Animal Migration; Animals; Birds; Breeding; Climate Change; Environment; Evolution; Germany; Global Warming; Linear Models; Phenotype; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Seasons; Animalia; Aves; Sylvia atricapilla",,,,,,"Solomon, S.D., Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis (2007) Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Parmesan, C., Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change (2006) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 37, pp. 637-669. , DOI 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110100; Walther, G.-R., Post, E., Convey, P., Menzel, A., Parmesan, C., Beebee, T.J.C., Fromentin, J.-M., Bairlein, F., Ecological responses to recent climate change (2002) Nature, 416 (6879), pp. 389-395. , DOI 10.1038/416389a; Bradshaw, W.E., Holzapfel, C.M., Genetic response to rapid climate change: It's seasonal timing that matters (2008) Mol Ecol, 17, pp. 157-166; Visser, M.E., Both, C., Shifts in phenology due to global climate change: The need for a yardstick (2005) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 272, pp. 2561-2569; Berteaux, D., Réale, D., McAdam, A.G., Boutin, S., Keeping pace with fast climate change: Can arctic life count on evolution?
