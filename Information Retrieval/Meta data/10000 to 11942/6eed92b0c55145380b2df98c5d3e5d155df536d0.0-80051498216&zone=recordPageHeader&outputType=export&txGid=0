The effects of 24 h exposure to heat stress (35±1 °C) on the morphology and function of pituitary adrenocorticotropes were examined in adult male Wistar rats. Significant changes in the morphofunctional features of adrenocorticotropes were found after the heat stress, with no differences noted in the cell shape or localization, compared to controls. The adrenocorticotropes cell volume, as well as the volume density, were significantly decreased (p<0.05) by 12.3% and 26.7%, respectively, in comparison with controls. The concentration of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum corticosterone in the heat stressed group were significantly decreased (p<0.05) by 21.9% and 27.2%, respectively, compared to controls. These findings suggest that 24 h exposure of adult male rats to heat stress has an inhibitory effect on the morphofunctional characteristics of adrenocorticotropes.","ACTH; heat stress; male rats","corticosterone; corticotropin; adrenal cortex; animal experiment; article; cell density; cell volume; climate; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; corticotropin blood level; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; heat stress; male; morphology; nonhuman; rat; summer; thermal exposure; Animalia; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus",,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; corticotropin, 11136-52-0, 9002-60-2, 9061-27-2",,,,"Dordević, J., Cvijić, G., Davidović, V., Different activation of ACTH and corticosterone release in response to various stressors in rats (2003) Physiol Res, 52, pp. 67-72; Bocheva, A., Dzambazova, E., Hadjiolova, R., Traikov, L., Mincheva, R., Bivolarski, I., Effect of Tyr-MIF-1 peptides on blood ACTH and corticosterone concentration induced by three experimental models of stress (2008) Auton Autacoid Pharmacol, 28, pp. 117-23; Aguilera, G., Regulation of pituitary ACTH secretion during chronic stress (1994) Front Neuroendocrinol, 15, pp. 331-50; Pantić, V., Biology of hypothalamic neurons and pituitary cells (1995) Int Rev Cytol, (159), pp. 1-112; Trainer, P.J., Faria, M., Newell-Price, J., Browne, P., Ko-Pelman, P., Coy, D.H., A comparison of the effects of human and ovine corticotrophin-releasing hormone on the pituitary-adrenal axis (1995) J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 80, pp. 412-17; Dunderski, J., Matić, G., Glucocorticoid receptor in health and disease (2009) Journal of Medical Biochemistry, 28, pp. 248-261; Childs, G.V., Structure-function correlates in the corti co-tropes of the anterior pituitary (1992) Front Neuroendocrinol, 13, pp. 271-317; Westlund, K.N., Aguilera, G., Childs, G.V., Quantification of morphological changes in pituitary corticotropes produced by in vivo corticotropin-releasing factor stimulation and adrenalectomy (1985) Endocrinology, 116 (1), pp. 439-445; Groenink, L., Van Der Gugten, J., Zethof, T., Van Der Heyden, J., Olivier, B., Stress-induced hyperthermia in mice: Hormonal correlates (1994) Physiology and Behavior, 56 (4), pp. 747-749. , DOI 10.1016/0031-9384(94)90237-2; Christison, G.I., Johnson, H.D., Cortisol turnover in heatstressed cow (1972) J Anim Sci, 35, p. 1005; Petrović, V., Janić-Šibalić, V., Effect of corticotropin and dexamethazone on monoamine oxidase activity in rat brain (1978) Bull Acad Serbe Sci, (61), pp. 1-4; Koko, V., Djordjeviae, J., Cvijiae, G., Davidoviae, V., Effect of acute heat stress on rat adrenal glands: A morphological and stereological study (2004) Journal of Experimental Biology, 207 (24), pp. 4225-4230. , DOI 10.1242/jeb.01280; Koko, V., Djordjevic, J., Cvijic, G., Davidovic, V., Effect of the acute heat stress on the rat pituitary gland.
