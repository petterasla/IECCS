There are many processes proposed to capture carbon either before or after combustion and these processes invariably involve investigation and application of traditional particuology. The solids employed are of different sizes, densities, morphologies, and strengths. Their handling, transportation, recirculation, and reactor applications are the essence of 'particuology'. Particuology can play an important and vital role in achieving cost-effective removal of carbon and minimize emissions of greenhouse gases. In this paper, the existing and developing carbon capture processes are briefly reviewed and the opportunities for application of particuology are identified. The review was not intended to be exhaustive. It is only in sufficient detail to make connection between particuology and climate change. For immediate and future challenges of reducing global warming and carbon capture and sequestration, innovative reactor design and application of particuology is imperative. Expertise and innovation in particuology can greatly enhance the speed of development of those technologies and help to achieve cost-effective implementation. Particuology is indeed intimately related to the climate change and global warming. © 2010 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Chemical looping; Circulating fluidized beds; Climate changes; Fluidized beds; Global warming; Oxycombustion; Particuology; Post-combustion; Pre-combustion","Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Chemical looping; Circulating fluidized bed; Oxycombustion; Particuology; Post-combustion; Pre-combustions; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Cost effectiveness; Fluidization; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Innovation; Fluidized bed combustion",,,,,,"Abanades, J.C., Anthony, E.J., Wang, J., Oakey, J.E., Fluidized bed combustion systems integrating CO 2 capture with CaO (2005) Environmental Science & Technology, 39, pp. 2861-2866; Power, A., (2003) Greenhouse Gas Emission Control by Oxygen Firing in Circulating Fluidized Bed Boilers: Phase 1.
