The result shows that new manufacturing system of Pb-free bronze made by removing Pb from scrap Pb-bronze reduces such environmental impacts as global warming, acidification, energy consumption, resource consumption significantly. Thus, in LCA perspective, the new manufacturing system using a recycling Pb-free bronze is superior to the former one using virgin materials. © 2005 The Japan Institute of Metals.","Lead-free bronze; Life cycle assessment; Recycle; Scrap bronze","Life cycle assessment; Scrap bronze; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Inventory control; Lead; Life cycle; Bronze",,,,,,"Cyuzou Kougaku Binran, p. 397. , Maruzen, Japan, 2002; (2002) Cyuzou Kougaku Binran, p. 437. , Maruzen, Japan; Yamada, K., Rochman, N.T., Fujimoto, R., Suehiro, S., Sueyoshi, H., (2001) J.
