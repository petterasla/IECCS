In the scenario of global warming, mountain ecosystems change rapidly, especially in the arid region of northwestern China. This paper provides an assessment of the changes in temperature and precipitation in the historical records of climate on the northern slopes of the eastern Tianshan Mountains. A Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend and Sen's tests are employed to analyze the interannual changes and innerannual variability in temperature and precipitation in the regions of low to high altitude. The present study finds that the largest increases in annual temperature are observed at stations in the low altitude regions. The significant increasing trends in temperature tend to occur mainly in late winter and early spring at stations from middle to high altitude, but in summer and autumn at stations of low altitudes. The increasing trends in annual precipitation are found from the middle to high altitude areas, but decreasing trends are found in the low altitude areas. The significant increasing trends in precipitation occur mostly in winter and earlier spring at stations from the middle to high altitudes, while the increasing and decreasing trend coexists at stations of low altitude with most of the significant trend changes occurring in March, June and August. © Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.","China; Climate change; Mountainous region; Precipitation; Temperature",,,,,,,"Aizen, V.B., Aizen, E.M., Melack, J.M., Dozier, J., Climate and hydrologic changes in the Tien Shan, central Asia (1997) Journal of Climate, 10, pp. 1393-1404; Beniston, M., Climate change in mountain regions: A review of possible impacts (2003) Climatic Change, 59, pp. 5-31; Beniston, M., Rebetez, M., Regional behavior of minimum temperatures in Switzerland for the period 1979-1993 (1996) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 53, pp. 231-244; Bolch, T., Climate change and glacier retreat in northern Tien Shan (Kazakhstan/ Kyrgyzstan) using remote sensing data (2007) Global and Planetary Change, 56, pp. 1-12; Burn, D.A., Klaus, J., McHale, M.R., Recent climate trends and implications for water resources in the Catskill Mountain region, New York, USA (2007) Journal of Hydrology, 336, pp. 155-170; Burn, D.H., Hesch, N.M., Trends in evaporation for the Canadian Prairies (2007) Journal of Hydrology, 336, pp. 61-73; Burns, D.A., Klaus, J., McHale, M.R., Recent climate trends and implications for water resources in the Catskill Mountain region, New York, USA (2007) Journal of Hydrology, 336, pp. 155-170; Buytaert, W., Célleri, R., Bièvre, B.D., Cisneros, F., Wyseure, G., Deckers, J., Hofstede, R., Human impact on the hydrology of the Andean páramos (2006) Earth-Science Reviews, 79, pp. 53-72; Buytaert, W., Célleri, R., Bièvre, B.D., Cisneros, F., Wyseure, G., Deckers, J., Hofstede, R., Human impact on the hydrology of the Andean páramos (2006) Earth-Science Review, 79, pp. 53-72; Chen, Y.N., Xu, Z.X., Plausible impact of globe climate change on water resources in the Tarim River Basin, China (2005) Science in China Ser.D, 48 (1), pp. 65-73; Dai, X.G., Li, W.J., Ma, Z.G., Wang, P., Water-vapor source shift of Xinjiang region during the recent twenty years (2007) Progress in Natural Science, 17, pp. 569-575; Foster, P., The potential negative impacts of global climate change on tropical montane cloud forests (2001) Earth-Science Reviews, 55, pp. 73-106; Gautam, A.P., Webb, E.L., Shivakoti, G.P., Zoebisch, M.A., Land use dynamics and landscape change pattern in a mountain watershed in Nepal (2003) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 99, pp. 83-96; Giese, E., Moßig, I., Klimawandel in Zentralasien (2004) Schriftenreihe Des Zentrums Internationale Entwicklungs- Und Umweltforschung, 17. , Giessen; Gordon, J.E., Haynes, V.M., Hubbard, A., Recent glacier changes and climate trends on South Georgia (2008) Global and Planetary Change, 60, pp. 72-84; Griffiths, R.P., Madritch, M.D., Swanson, A.K., The effects of topography on forest soil characteristics in the Oregon Cascade Mountains (USA): Implications for the effects of climate change on soil properties (2009) Forest Ecology and Management, 257, pp. 1-7; Helsel, D.R., Hirsch, R.M., (1992) Statistical Methods in Water Resources, p. 522. , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Innes, J.L., Magnitude-frequency relations of debris flows in north-west Europe (1985) Geografiska Annaler, 67 A, pp. 23-32; (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, , IPCC.
