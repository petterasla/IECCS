During the last decade, significant achievements have been reached in attaining this goal. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber cleaning and plasma etch are two processes that use PFCs in which studies have been conducted to reduce emissions. Two successful strategies for reducing PFC emissions and enhancing process performance are described.","Chamber clean; Chemical vapor deposition (CVD); Emissions; Perfluorocompound (PFC); Plasma etch","Fluorine compounds; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Global warming; Optimization; Particulate emissions; Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Plasma etching; Semiconductor materials; Thin films; Chamber clean; Environmental health and safety (EHS); Perfluorocompound (PFC) emissions; Plasma etch; Environmental protection",,,,,,"Johnson, A.D., Entley, W.R., Maroulis, P.J., Reducing PFC gas emissions from CVD chamber cleaning (2000) Solid State Technol., p. 103. , Dec; Johnson, A.D., Minimizing PFC emissions from existing PECVD tools (2000) Proc.
