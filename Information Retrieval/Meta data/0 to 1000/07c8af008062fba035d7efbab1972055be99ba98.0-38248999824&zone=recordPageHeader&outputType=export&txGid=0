The data also suggest that this primary relationship may be modified by CO2-induced changes in leaf chlorophyll content that may have implications for global climate change. © 1993.","Carbon dioxide; CO2; leaf temperature; stomatal conductance; trees",,,,,,,"Arp, Effects of source-sink relations on photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 (1991) Plant Cell Environ., 14, pp. 869-875; Bunce, Stomatal conductance, photosyntheses and respiration of temperature deciduous tree seedlings grown outdoors at an elevated concentration of carbon dioxide (1992) Plant Cell Environ., 15, pp. 541-549; Cure, Acock, Crop responses to carbon dioxide doubling: a literature survey (1986) Agric.
