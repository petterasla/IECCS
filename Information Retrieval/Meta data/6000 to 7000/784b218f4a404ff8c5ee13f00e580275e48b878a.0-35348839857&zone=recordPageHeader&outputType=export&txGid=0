Concerns about climate change dictate that the source be clean and not contribute to global warming. Hydrogen has been identified as such a source for many years and the transition to a hydrogen economy was predicted to occur from the mid-1970s to 2000. This paper reports on the status of this transition in the year 2006. Instead of being a clean source of energy, most of the hydrogen produced in the US results from steam reforming of fossil fuels, releasing CO2 and other pollutants to the atmosphere. Nuclear process heat is ideally suited for the production of hydrogen, either using electricity for electrolysis of water, or heat for thermochemical hydrogen production or reforming of fossil fuels. However, no new nuclear plants have been ordered or built in the United States since 1979, and it may be many years before high-temperature nuclear reactors are available for production of hydrogen. Considerable research and development efforts are focused on commercializing hydrogen-powered vehicles to lessen the dependence of the transportation sector on imported oil. However, the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV) in 2006 is two orders-of-magnitude less than what has been predicted. Although it makes little sense environmentally or economically, hydrogen is also used as fuel in internal combustion engines. Development of hydrogen economy will require a strong intervention by external forces. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen production; Nuclear energy; Transportation","Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear energy; United States; Electrolysis of water; Greenhouse gas emissions; High-temperature nuclear reactors; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen production",,,,,,"Bockris, J., The origin of ideas on a hydrogen economy and its solution to the decay of the environment (2002) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 27, pp. 731-740; Romm, J., (2005) The hype about hydrogen, , Island Press, Washington, DC; Roberts, P., (2004) The end of oil: on the edge of a perilous new world, , Houghton Mifflin Co., New York, NY; Silberud, R., (2001) Our future is hydrogen, , New Science Publications, Wellington, CO; Ledley, T., Sundquist, E., Schwartz, S., Hall, D., Fellows, J., Killeen, T., Climate change and greenhouse gases (1999) EOS, 80 (39), p. 453; Nakicenovic, N., Grubler, A., McDonald, A., (1998) Global energy perspectives, , University Press, Cambridge, UK; Crabtree, G., Dresselhaus, M., Buchanan, M., The hydrogen economy (2004) Physics Today, 57, pp. 39-44; Richards, M., Shenoy, A., Schulz, K., Brown, L., Harvego, E., McKellar, M., Coupey, J., Handa, N., H2-MHR conceptual designs based on the sulfur-iodine process and high-temperature electrolysis (2006) Int J Nuclear Hydrogen Prod Appl, 1 (1), pp. 36-50; Valette, P., Valette, L., Siebker, M., LeClerq, L., Analysis of a Delphi study on hydrogen (1978) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 3, pp. 251-259; Utgikar, V., Thiesen, T., Life cycle assessment of high temperature electrolysis for hydrogen production via nuclear energy (2006) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 31, pp. 939-944; Utgikar, V., Ward, B., Life cycle assessment of ISPRA Mark 9 thermochemical cycle for nuclear hydrogen production (2006) J Chem Technol Biotechnol, 81, pp. 1753-1759; Petri, M., Yildiz, B., Klickman, A., U.S. work on technical and economic aspects of electrolytic, thermochemical, and hybrid processes for hydrogen production at temperatures below 550 {ring operator} C (2006) Int J Nucl Hydrogen Prod Appl, 1 (1), pp. 79-91; Ivry, R., Nuclear power heats up (again).
