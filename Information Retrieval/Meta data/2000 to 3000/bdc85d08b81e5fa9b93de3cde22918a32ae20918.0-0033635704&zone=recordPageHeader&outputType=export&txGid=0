The most important ongoing surveys from this viewpoint are as follows: the Ringing Scheme which gives information on annual mortality, the Nest Record Card Scheme which provides data on reproductive success, the Common Birds Census which gives an index of population, the Constant Effort Sites which monitors productivity and survival and the Breeding Bird Survey which complements and is replacing the Common Birds Census. The use of these databases in unravelling the effects of intensive agriculture on avian populations is discussed. The use of these databases to monitor global warming is also considered.","Assessment; Avian databases; Intensive agriculture monitoring","avifauna; database; environmental assessment; agriculture; article; bird; data base; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; mortality; nonhuman; population research; priority journal; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Baillie, S.R., Gregory, R.D., Siriwardena, G., Farmland bird declines: Patterns, processes and prospects (1997) BCPC Symposium Proceeding, 69, pp. 65-86; Balmer, D., Wernham, W., Many long-term declines continue on constant effect sites (1999) BTO News, 221, pp. 10-11; Bashford, R., The breeding bird survey; the first five years (1999) BTO News, 224, pp. 10-12; Ter Braak, C.J.F., Van Strein, A.J., Meijer, R., Verstrael, T.J., Analysis of monitoring data with many missing values: Which method?
