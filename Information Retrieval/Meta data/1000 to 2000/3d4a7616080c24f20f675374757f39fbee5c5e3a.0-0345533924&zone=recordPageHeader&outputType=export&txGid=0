This tool provides a quick-and-easy means of assessing the environmental impacts of a complex product, where a full LCA evaluation of the complex product would often require extensive calculations and the analysis is very time-consuming and places a heavy burden on the designer. The tool allows a designer to easily compute a total environmental impact value for each of the various alternative designs. The pre-LCA tool computes an environmental impact value by considering factors such as airborne and waterborne emissions, the recyclability potential, waste disposal, the global warming factor, the energy content of raw materials, the divertible plastic waste potential, etc. The analytical hierarchy comparison method is used for the designers to indicate the relative importance of these factors with respect to their designs. Environmental values for the various factors are calculated from graphs that have been derived based on extensive interviews with engineers involved in the production process, as well as from literature research.",,"Environmental impact; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Process engineering; Product design; Production; Risk assessment; Waste disposal; Complex products; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle",,,,,,"Bhat, V.N., (1996) The next Competitive Advantage, , Quorum Books, London; Ayres, R.U., Saxton, J.C., Stern, M.O., (1974) Materials-Process-Product Model - A Feasibility Demonstration Based on the Bottle Manufacturing Industry, , IRT-305-FR, National Science Foundation, International Research and Technology Corporation, Washington, DC; Bullard, C.W., Penner, P.S., Pilati, D.A., Net energy analysis: Handbook for combining process and input-output analysis (1978) Res.
