Year-round sun protection achieved by the inclusion of ultraviolet (UV) filters in skin care products intended for daily use is not indicated for people living in northern Europe and may, in fact, be potentially harmful. Future needs for sun protection are likely to be influenced more by global warming than ozone depletion, and by the rising trend for overseas holidays to sunny destinations.",,"sunscreen; conference paper; Europe; greenhouse effect; human; ozone layer; radiation exposure; skin care; skin protection; ultraviolet radiation",,,,,,"Roy, C., Gies, H., Toomey, S., Monitoring UV-B at the earth's surface (1996) Cancer Forum, 20, pp. 173-179; (1998), CIE Standard.
