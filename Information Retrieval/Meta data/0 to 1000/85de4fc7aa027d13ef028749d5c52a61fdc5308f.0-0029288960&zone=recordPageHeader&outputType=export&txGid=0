Simulations were run with increased temperatures of 2°C combined with a 10 percent increase or decrease in total growing season precipitation. Changes in precipitation were applied either evenly across all months or to individual seasons (spring, summer, or fall). The response of semi-permanent wetland P1 was relatively similar under most of the seasonal scenarios. A 10 percent increase in total growing season precipitation applied to summer months only, to fall months only, and over all months produced lower water levels compared to those resulting from the current climate due to increased evapotranspiration. Wetland hydrology was most affected by changes in spring precipitation and runoff. Vegetation response was relatively consistent across scenarios. Seven of the eight seasonal scenarios produced drier conditions with no open water and greater vegetation cover compared to those resulting from the current climate. Only when spring precipitation increased did the wetland maintain an extensive open water area (49 percent). The model's sensitivity to changes in temperature and seasonal precipitation patterns accentuates the need for accurate regional climate change projections from general circulation models.",,"Climate change; Geographic information systems; Mathematical models; Simulation; Global warming; Prairie wetlands; Seasonal precipitation; Vegetation dynamics; Waterfowl habitat; Hydrology",,,,,,,"Poiani, K.A.; Cornell Univ, Ithaca, United States",,,"American Water Resources Assoc, Bethesda, MD, United States",,,,,00431370,,WARBA,,"English","Water Resour Bull",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029288960
