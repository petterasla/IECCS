Since Egyptian scientists agree with us to do collaboration, the energy balance and the amount of reduction of CO2 emission in the global CO2 recycling between Middle East and Japan are estimated for the operation of a 1 GW CH4-combustion power plant. The energy consumed in a year up to liquefaction of CH4 including that corresponding to the repayment of solar power plant is almost the same as that spent up to obtaining LNG. The energy necessary for the global CO2 recycling is only 8.7% higher than the energy necessary for LNG combustion for power generation without control of CO2 emission. The extra energy is for recovery, liquefaction and transportation of CO2. The reduction of CO2 emission by the global CO2 recycling is 79% of CO2 emission from an LNG combustion power plant, that is, 2.62 Mtons/year.","Catalyst; CH4; CO2; Electrode; Energy supply; Global CO2 recycling; Global warming",,,,,,,"Hara, M., Hashimoto, K., Masumoto, T., (1980) Electrochim.
