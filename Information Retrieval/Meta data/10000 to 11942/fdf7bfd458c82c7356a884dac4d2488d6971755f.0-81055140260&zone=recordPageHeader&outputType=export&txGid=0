We tested the effects of increased temperature (15 and 20°C, optimal and suboptimal temperatures, respectively) on metabolic rates of the shredder larvae Sericostoma vittatum fed on three diets, Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn., Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Quercus robur L. We measured P and N content in leaves, faeces and excreta and calculated C, N, and P assimilation efficiencies, and mass balances. Carbon assimilation efficiency (AE) was reduced at 20°C when larvae fed on Q. robur; nitrogen-AE was reduced at 20°C in all diets and phosphorus-AE was not affected by temperature. Larvae achieved a net N gain in all treatments, however, increased temperatures had a negative effect on N incorporation into body tissue. The mass balance of P was negatively affected by temperature; larvae fed on Q. robur and on E. globulus had null balances at 15°C and negative at 20°C. Our results showed that high temperature increased nutrient excretion and affected N:P ratios in excreta, thus changes in temperature may have severe consequences on larval mediated leaf litter processing and nutrient cycling. However, the type of diet seemed to modulate the way temperature affects larval metabolism regarding excretion rate and assimilation efficiencies. The extent to which optimal-suboptimal temperature variation will alter detritivore metabolism performance, internal nutrient balance and hence, cycling of elements in the environment seems crucial under global warming scenarios. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Detritivores; Ecological stoichiometry; Nutrient cycling; Streams; Temperature","assimilation efficiency; deciduous tree; detritivory; diet; ecosystem dynamics; evergreen tree; feeding; food quality; high temperature; larva; leaf litter; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; stoichiometry; streamwater; temperature effect; temperature gradient; warming; Alnus; Alnus glutinosa; Animalia; Eucalyptus globulus; Quercus robur; Sericostoma vittatum",,,,,,"Abelho, M., From litterfall to breakdown in streams: a review (2001) The Scientific World, 1, pp. 656-680; Albariño, R., Balseiro, E., Food quality, larval consumption and growth of Klapopteryx kuscheli (Plecoptera) from a South Andes stream (2001) Journal of Freshwater Ecology, 16, pp. 517-526; (1989) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage, and Wastewater, , American Public Health Association (APHA), Washington, D.C: American Public Health Association; Anderson, T.R., Boersma, M., Raubenheimer, D., Stoichiometry: linking elements to biochemicals (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 1193-1202; Bärlocher, F., A primer for statistical analysis (2005) Methods to Study Litter Decomposition, pp. 297-304. , M.
