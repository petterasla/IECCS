A mathematical model is described for assessing quantitatively how the hybrid policy of carbon tax and emissions trading would be effective to achieve the targeted reduction of the post-Kyoto target. We use a method of decision analysis called Prospect Theory under Uncertainty. © 2011 IFAC.","Decision theory; Global environment; Policy evaluation; Uncertainty; Utility functions","Carbon taxes; Emissions Trading; Global environment; Policy evaluation; Prospect theory; Uncertainty; Utility functions; Commerce; Decision theory; Mathematical models; Uncertainty analysis; Emission control",,,,,,"(1997) Basic Unit of CO 2 Emissions Based on the Input-Output Table, , http://www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-j/db/co2.html/; Ellsberg, D., Risk, ambiguity and the Savage axioms (1961) Quart.
