One major unknown in current peatland emission estimations is how much peat is combusted by fire. Using a light detection and ranging data set acquired in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, in 2007, one year after the severe peatland fires of 2006, we determined an average burn scar depth of 0.33 ± 0.18 m. Based on this result and the burned area determined from satellite imagery,we estimate that within the 2.79 million hectare study area 49.15±26.81 megatons of carbon were released during the 2006 El Niño episode. This represents 10-33% of all carbon emissions from transport for the European Community in the year 2006. These emissions, originating from a comparatively small area (approximately 13% of the Indonesian peatland area), underline the importance of peat fires in the context of green house gas emissions and global warming. In the past decade severe peat fires occurred during El Niño-induced droughts in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2009. Currently, this important source of carbon emissions is not included in IPCC carbon accounting or in regional and global carbon emission models. Precise spatial measurements of peat combusted and potential avoided emissions in tropical peat swamp forests will also be required for future emission trading schemes in the framework of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries.","Climate change; Fires; Indonesia; Remote sensing; Tropical peat","carbon; fossil fuel; article; burn scar; carbon dynamics; carbon emission; combustion; drought; El Nino; fire; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Indonesia; light detection and ranging; peatland; priority journal; remote sensing; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Droughts; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Global Warming; Indonesia; Wetlands",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Air Pollutants; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Immirzi, C.P., Maltby, E., Clymo, R.S., (1992) The Global Status of Peatlands and Their Role in Carbon Cycling (Wetlands Research Group, Friends of the Earth, London), Rep, (11); Page, S.E., Banks, C., Tropical peatlands: Distribution, extent and carbon storage - uncertainties and knowledge gaps (2007) Peatlands International, 2, pp. 26-27; Rieley, J.O., Ahmad-Shah, A.A., Brady, M.A., (1996) Tropical Lowland Peatlands of Southeast Asia, pp. 17-53. , eds Maltby E, Immirzi CP, Safford RJ IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, pp; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
