The situation is compounded by claims that global warming will have a serious adverse effect on future water supplies. There was therefore an urgent need to characterise the numerical properties of the hydrometeorological processes in such a way that the effects of global warming, if any, could be evaluated and accommodated. Other than increases in both areal rainfall and open water surface evaporation, no other changes were detected, that could be attributed to climate change arising from human activities. Nor is there evidence to support the view that such changes are likely to occur within the normal planning horizon of the next 30 years. A climate prediction model was developed based on the statistically significant 21-year periodicity in the hydrometeorological processes, and its direct association with corresponding periodicity in solar activity.","Climate change; Climate model; Water resources","Economics; Global warming; Water resources; Climate prediction model; Open water surface; Water supplies; Climate change; climate change; climate prediction",,,,,,"Abu-Zeid, M.A., Biswas, A.K., (1992) Climatic Fluctuations and Water Management, 356p. , Butterworth-Heineman; Alexander, W.J.R., (1978) Long Range Prediction of River Flow - A Preliminary Assessment, , Technical Report TR80.
