Analysis of long-term datasets reveals a high degree of plasticity in the nature of phenological responses both within and among species, and understanding these differences is central to understanding the mechanisms and implications of climate-related change. We investigated factors influencing timing of breeding (median laying date) in a colonial nesting seabird, the common guillemot Uria aalge, over 23 breeding seasons between 1973 and 2008. There was a trend for earlier laying over this period, and earlier laying was associated with higher average breeding success. Multiple regression models (with de-trended explanatory variables to control for linear trends over time) indicate that the timing of breeding is positively correlated with a wide-scale climatic driver, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (WNAO), and negatively correlated with population size: guillemots lay later in years with high WNAO indices and earlier in years with larger populations. Responses to environmental conditions are probably related to indirect effects on timing or abundance of food availability, direct effects of weather or both. The mechanism(s) leading to a possible relationship between laying date and population size are less clear. They may be related to Allee-type effects associated with social stimulation, improved foraging efficiency or a densitydependent increase in breeding site quality. Given the correlative nature of these results, we are cautious about the role of non-climatic (intrinsic) factors, but we cannot exclude that they play a role alongside climatic (extrinsic) factors in influencing reproductive phenology. © 2009 Inter-Research.","Allee effect; Climate change; Coloniality; Density dependence; NAO; Phenology","Allee effect; breeding season; climate change; colony structure; environmental conditions; global climate; North Atlantic Oscillation; phenology; population density; population size; regression analysis; reproductive biology; seabird; Alcidae; Uria aalge",,,,,,"Attrill, M.J., Power, M., Climatic influence on a marine fish assemblage (2002) Nature, 417, pp. 275-278; Barbosa, A., Moreno, J., Potti, J., Merino, S., Breeding group size, nest position and breeding success in the chinstrap penguin (1997) Polar Biol, 18, pp. 410-414; Birkhead, T.R., The effect of habitat and density on breeding success in the common guillemot (Uria aalge) (1977) J Anim Ecol, 46, pp. 751-764; Birkhead, T.R., (1978) Attendance Patterns of Guillemots Uria Aalge at Breeding Colonies on Skomer Island, 120, pp. 219-229. , Ibis; Birkhead, T.R., Behavioural adaptations to high-density nesting in the common guillemot Uria aalge (1978) Anim Behav, 26, pp. 321-331; Birkhead, T.R., Nettleship, D.N., Census methods for murres, Uria species: A unified approach (1980) Can Wildl Serv Occas Pap, 43, pp. 1-25; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Charmantier, A., McCleery, R.H., Cole, L.R., Perrins, C., Kruuk, L.E.B., Sheldon, B.C., Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to climate change in a wild bird population (2008) Science, 320, pp. 800-803; Coulson, J.C., Colonial breeding in seabirds (2002) Biology of Marine Birds, pp. 87-113. , Schreiber EA, Burger J (eds) CRC Press, London; Coulson, J.C., White, E., (1960) The Effect of Age and Density of Breeding Birds on the Time of Breeding of the Kittiwake Rissa Tridactyla, 102, pp. 71-86. , Ibis; Courchamp, F., Ludek, B., Gascoigne, J., (2008) Allee Effects in Ecology and Conservation, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Crespin, L., Harris, M.P., Lebreton, J.D., Frederiksen, M., Wanless, S., Recruitment to a seabird population depends on environmental factors and on population size (2006) J Anim Ecol, 75, pp. 228-238; Darling, F.F., (1938) Bird Flocks and the Breeding Cycle, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Durant, J.M., Anker-Nilssen, T., Hjermann, D.O., Stenseth, N.C., Regime shifts in the breeding of an Atlantic puffin population (2004) Ecol Lett, 7, pp. 388-394; Durant, J.M., Hjermann, D.O., Anker-Nilssen, T., Beaugrand, G., Mysterud, A., Pettorelli, N., Stenseth, N.C., Timing and abundance as key mechanisms affecting trophic interactions in variable environments (2005) Ecol Lett, 8, pp. 952-958; Finney, S.K., Wanless, S., Harris, M.P., The effect of weather conditions on the feeding behaviour of a diving bird, the common guillemot Uria aalge (1999) J Avian Biol, 30, pp. 23-30; Frederiksen, M., Harris, M.P., Daunt, F., Rothery, P., Wanless, S., Scale-dependent climate signals drive breeding phenology of three seabird species (2004) Glob Change Biol, 10, pp. 1214-1221; Greene, C.M., Stamps, J.A., Habitat selection at low population densities (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 2091-2100; Grünbaum, D., Veit, R.R., Black-browed albatrosses foraging on Antarctic krill: Density-dependence through local enhancement?
