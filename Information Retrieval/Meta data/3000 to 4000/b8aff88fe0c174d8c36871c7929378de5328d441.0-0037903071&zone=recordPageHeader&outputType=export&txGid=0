Although the Norwegian government has been relatively proactive in instituting measures aimed at halting global climate change, less attention has been paid to the challenge of adapting to climate change. The global climate system is likely to undergo changes, regardless of the implementation of abatement policies under the Kyoto Protocol or other regimes. The full range of impacts resulting from these changes is still uncertain; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that adaptation to climate change is necessary and inevitable within several sectors. The potential impacts of climate change in the built environment are now being addressed. Both the functionality of the existing built environment and the design of future buildings are likely to be altered by climate change impacts, and the expected implications of these new conditions are now investigated. However, measures aimed at adjustments within individual sectors, such as altering the criteria and codes of practice for the design and construction of buildings, constitute only a partial adaptation to climate change. In order to adapt effectively, larger societal and intersectoral adjustments are necessary.","Adaptation strategies; Building performance; Building stock; Climate change; Climate policy; Global warming risk; Norway; Vulnerability","Building codes; Climate change; Construction industry; Environmental impact; Global warming; Public policy; Risk assessment; Adaptation strategies; Building performance; Built environment; Climate policy; Norway; Buildings",,,,,,"Adger, N., (1996) Approaches to Vulnerability to Climate Change, pp. 1-63. , Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, Norwich; Bornehag, C.G., Dampness in buildings and health: Nordic interdisciplinary review of the scientific evidence on associations between exposure to 'dampness' in buildings and health (NORDDAMP) (2001) Indoor Air, 11 (2), pp. 72-86; Camilleri, M., Impacts of climate change on building performance in New Zealand (2001) Building Research and Information, 29 (6), pp. 440-450; Chambers, R., Vulnerability, coping and policy (1989) IDS Bulletin, 20, pp. 1-7; Dolan, A.H., (2001) Adaptation to Climate Change in Agriculture: Evaluation of Options, , Occasional Paper No. 26, Department of Geography, University of Guelph; Downing, T.E., Climate change and food insecurity: Towards a sociology and geography of vulnerability (1995) Climate Change and World Food Security, pp. 183-206. , Springer, Berlin; Gujarat's Catastrophe [Editorial] (2001) The Economist, , 3 February; Eriksen, S.H., Dynamism in coping and local patterns of vulnerability: The case of Mbitini, Kenya and Saweni, Tanzania (2002), (submitted)Graves, H.M., Phillipson, M.C., (2000) Potential Implications of Climate Change in the Built Environment, , FBE Report 2 December 2000, BRE Centre for Environmental Engineering/BRE East Kilbride, Construction Research Communications; Ingvaldsen, T., (1994) Building Damage in Norway, , NBI Project Report 163, Norwegian Building Research Institute, Oslo.
