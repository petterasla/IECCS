It is found that the thickness near the margin differs appreciably in these two simulations under identical conditions of modest warming, primarily due to a significant increase in the warming effect by an elevation-ablation feedback mechanism in one of the simulations. The change in ice-sheet volume differs by as much as a factor of two under strong climate-change forcing, demonstrating the need for care in interpreting the results of such climate-change analysis.",,"global warming; ice sheet; numerical method; simulation; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet",,,,,,"Abe-Ouchi, A., Ice-sheet response to climate changes: A modelling approach (1993) Zürcher Geogr.
