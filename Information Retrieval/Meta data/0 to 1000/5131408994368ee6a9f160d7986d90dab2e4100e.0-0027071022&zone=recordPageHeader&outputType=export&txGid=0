Two minimum temperature criteria of 0° and -3°C were used in assessing freeze dates. Half of the stations had no change in growing season length over the last 65 years, whereas the other four stations had a lengthening of the season. Tendencies for longer seasons were in part a result of earlier spring freezes. The growing season shortened at three stations during the period 1940-70, which corresponded with declining Northern Hemisphere temperatures. The presence of changes in the growing season over the last 65 years was apparent in Alaska temperature records. -from Author",,"climate record; frost; growing season; temperature trend; USA, Alaska",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027071022
