It is argued that external stresses and shocks relating to sea-level rise and other changes will tend to exacerbate existing environmental pressures and damage in coastal zones. Coastal zones are under increasing stress because of an interrelated set of planning failures including information, economic market, and policy intervention failures. Moves towards integrated coastal zone management are urgently required to guide the coevolution of natural and human systems. Overtly technocentric claims that assessments of vulnerability undertaken to date are overestimates of likely future damages from global warming are premature. While it is the case that forecasts of sea-level rise have been scaled down, much uncertainty remains over, for example, combined storm, sea surge, and other events. In any case, within the socioeconomic analyses of the problem, resource valuations have been at best only partial and have failed to incorporate sensitivity analysis in terms of the discount rates utilized. This would indicate an underestimation of potential damage costs. Overall, a precautionary approach is justified based on the need to act ahead of adequate information acquisition, economically efficient resource pricing and proactive coastal planning.","Climate change; Coastal zone management; Environmental damage valuation; Sea-level rise","climate; economic aspect; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; management; policy; review; seashore; socioeconomics; stress; climate change; coastal development; socioeconomics",,,,,,"Barbier, E.B., (1989) The Economic Value of Ecosystems: 1 - Tropical Wetlands, , LEEC Gatekeeper 89-02, London Environmental Economics Centre, London; Barbier, E.B., Valuing environmental functions: Tropical wetlands (1994) Land Economics, 70, pp. 155-173; Berz, G., Natural disasters in 1991: Claims burdens reaching new records (1991) Schadenspiegel, 1, pp. 14-17; Bigford, T.E., Sea-level rise, nearshore fisheries and the fishing industry (1991) Coastal Zone Management, 19, pp. 417-437; Broadus, J.M., Possible impacts of, and adjustments to, sea-level rise: The cases of Bangladesh and Egypt (1993) Climate and Sea-level Change: Observations, Projections and Implications, pp. 263-275. , R.
