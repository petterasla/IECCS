Depending on resource availability and plant species identity, these rhizosphere effects can be positive or negative. To date, studies of rhizosphere effects have been limited to plant species grown individually. It is unclear how belowground resources and inter-specific interactions among plants may influence rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition and plant N uptake. In this study, we tested the simple and interactive effects of plant diversity and water availability on rhizosphere-mediated soil C decomposition and plant N uptake. The study was conducted in the greenhouse with five semi-arid grassland species (monocultures and mixtures of all five species) and two water levels (15 and 20% gravimetric soil moisture content). We hypothesized that microbial decomposition and N release would be less in the low compared to high water treatment and less in mixtures compared to monocultures. Rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition were both positive and negative among the five species when grown in monoculture, although negative effects prevailed by the end of the experiment. When grown in mixture, rhizosphere effects reduced soil C decomposition and plant N uptake compared to monocultures, but only at the low-water level. Our results suggest that when water availability is low, plant species complementarity and selection effects on water and N use can decrease soil C decomposition through rhizosphere effects. Although complementarity and selection effects can increase plant N uptake efficiency, plant N uptake in the mixtures was still lower than expected, most likely because rhizosphere effects reduced N supply in the mixtures more than in the monocultures. Our results indicate that rhizosphere effects on C and N cycling depend on water availability and inter-specific plant interactions. Negative rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition and N supply in mixtures relative to monocultures of the component species could ultimately increase soil C storage and possibly influence how plant communities in semi-arid grasslands respond to global climate change. © 2010.","13C isotopes; Complementarity and selection effects; Decomposition; GRACEnet publication; Microbial activity; Nitrogen uptake; Plant species diversity; Priming effect; Semi-arid grassland; Soil moisture","<sup>13</sup>C isotopes; Microbial activities; Nitrogen uptake; Plant species diversity; Priming effects; Semi-arid grasslands; Climate change; Forestry; Isotopes; Mixtures; Moisture determination; Soil moisture; Water content; Water levels; Water treatment; Water resources; carbon isotope; climate change; decomposition; grassland; interspecific competition; litter; microbial activity; mineralization; monoculture; nutrient uptake; plant community; rhizosphere; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil organic matter; species diversity; water availability; water stress",,,,,,"Badeck, F.W., Tcherkez, G., Nogués, S., Piel, C., Ghashghaie, J., Post-photosynthetic fractionation of stable carbon isotopes between plant organs - a widespread phenomenon (2005) Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 19, pp. 1381-1391; Bathellier, C., Badeck, F.-W., Couzi, P., Harscoet, S., Mauve, C., Ghashghaie, J., Divergence in δ13C of dark respired CO2 and bulk organic matter occurs during the transition between heterotrophy and autotrophy in Phaseolus vulgaris plants (2008) New Phytologist, 177, pp. 406-418; Bowling, D.R., Pataki, D.E., Randerson, J.T., Carbon isotopes in terrestrial ecosystem pools and CO2 fluxes (2008) New Phytologist, 178, pp. 24-40; Burke, I.C., Lauenroth, W.K., Parton, W.J., Regional and temporal variation in net primary production and nitrogen mineralization in grasslands (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1330-1340; Cheng, W., Measurement of rhizosphere respiration and organic matter decomposition using natural 13C (1996) Plant and Soil, 183, pp. 263-268; Cheng, W., Rhizosphere feedbacks in elevated CO2 (1999) Tree Physiology, 19, pp. 313-320; Cheng, W., Kuzyakov, Y., Root effects on soil organic matter decomposition (2005) Roots and Soil Management: Interactions between Roots and the Soil, pp. 119-143. , ASA-SSSA, Madison, Wisconsin, R.W.
