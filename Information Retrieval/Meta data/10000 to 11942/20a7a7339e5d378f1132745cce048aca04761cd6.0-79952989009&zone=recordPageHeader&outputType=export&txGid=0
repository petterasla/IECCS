According to latest World Health Organization estimates, about 900 million people still lack access to safe drinking water, about 2.5 billion people lack access to proper sanitation, millions of people die every year from water-related disasters and diseases, and economic losses in the order of billions of dollars occur due to water-related disasters. With the global climate change anticipated to have threatening consequences on our water resources and environment both at the global level and at local/regional levels (e.g. increases in the number and magnitude of floods and droughts, increases in sea levels), a general assessment is that the future state of our water resources will be a lot worse than it is now. The facts that over 300 rivers around the world are being shared by two or more nation states and that there are already numerous conflicts in the planning, development, and management of water resources in these basins further complicate matters for future water resources planning. In view of these, any sincere effort towards proper management of our future water resources and resolving potential future water-related conflicts will need to overcome many challenges. These challenges are both biophysical science-related and human science-related. The biophysical science challenges include: identification of the actual causes of climate change, development of global climate models (GCMs) that can adequately incorporate these causes to generate dependable future climate projections at larger scales, formulation of appropriate techniques to downscale the GCM outputs to local conditions for hydrologic predictions, and reliable estimation of the associated uncertainties in all these. The human science challenges have social, political, economic, and environmental facets that often act in an interconnected manner; proper 'communication' of (or lack thereof) our climate-water 'scientific' research activities to fellow scientists and engineers, policy makers, economists, industrialists, farmers, and the public at large crucially contributes to these challenges. The present study is intended to review the current state of our water resources and the climate change problem and to detail the challenges in dealing with the potential impacts of climate change on our water resources. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Climate change; Impact assessment; Policy; Science; Society; Water resources","Appropriate techniques; Economic loss; Fresh water resources; Future climate; Global climate changes; Global climate model; Global levels; Human science; Hydrologic prediction; Impact assessments; Local conditions; Policy; Policy makers; Population explosion; Potential impacts; Research activities; Safe drinking water; Science; Scientists and engineers; Society; Water resources planning; World Health Organization; Climate models; Deforestation; Disasters; Economics; Electronic equipment manufacture; Planning; Potable water; Rating; Sea level; Water management; Water pollution; Water resources exploration; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; disaster management; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; global change; nature-society relations; resource development; water management; water planning; water resource",,,,,,"Abarbanel, H.D.I., Lall, U., Nonlinear dynamics of the Great Salt Lake: system identification and prediction (1996) Clim Dyn, 12, pp. 287-297; Arnell, N.W., Hudson, D.A., Jones, R.G., Climate change scenarios from a regional climate model: estimating change in runoff in southern Africa (2003) J Geophys Res, 108 (D16), pp. 4519-4528; Bardossy, A., Bogardi, I., Matyasovszky, I., Fuzzy rule-based downscaling of precipitation (2005) Theor Appl Climatol, 82, pp. 119-129; Barnett, T., Hasselmann, K., Chelliah, M., Delworth, T., Hegerl, G., Jones, P., Rasmusson, E., Tett, S., Detection and attribution of recent climate change: a status report (1999) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 80, pp. 2631-2659; Barnett, T., Malone, T., Pennell, W., Stammer, D., Semtner, B., Washington, W., The effects of climate change on water resources in the west: introduction and overview (2004) Clim Change, 62, pp. 1-11; Benestad, R.E., A comparison between two empirical downscaling strategies (2001) Int J Climatol, 21, pp. 1645-1668; Bergstrom, S., Carlsson, B., Gardelin, M., Lindstrom, G., Pettersson, A., Rummukainen, M., Climate change impacts on run-off in Sweden-assessments by global climate models, dynamical downscaling and hydrological modeling (2001) Clim Res, 16, pp. 101-112; Beven, K.J., Prophecy, reality and uncertainty in distributed hydrological modelling (1993) Adv Water Resour, 16, pp. 41-51; Beven, K.J., Uncertainty and the detection of structural change in models of environmental systems (2002) Environmental Foresight and Models: A Manifesto, pp. 227-250. , M.
