GHG contributions were categorized with respect to direct emissions from the combustion plant as well as indirect upstream contributions (e.g. provision of fuels and materials) and indirect downstream contributions (e.g. substitution of electricity and heat produced elsewhere). GHG accounting was done per tonne of waste received at the plant. The content of fossil carbon in the input waste, for example as plastic, was found to be critical for the overall level of the GHG emissions, but also the energy conversion efficiencies were essential. The emission factors for electricity provision (also substituted electricity) affected the indirect downstream emissions with a factor of 3-9 depending on the type of electricity generation assumed. Provision of auxiliary fuels, materials and resources corresponded to up to 40% of the direct emission from the plants (which were 347-371 kg CO 2-eq. tonne-1 of waste for incineration and 735-803 kg CO2-eq. tonne-1 of waste for co-combustion). Indirect downstream savings were within the range of -480 to -1373 kg CO2eq. tonne-1 of waste for incineration and within -181 to -2607 kg CO 2-eq. tonne- 1 of waste for co-combustion. N2O emissions and residue management did not appear to play significant roles.","Co-combustion; Co-incineration; CO2 accounting; Global warming; Incineration; Solid recovered fuel (SRF); Thermal treatment","Auxiliary fuels; Co-incineration; CO2 accounting; Cocombustion; Combustion plants; Direct emissions; Electricity generation; Emission factors; Energy recovery; Fossil carbon; GHG emission; Residue management; Solid residues; Thermal treatment; Carbon monoxide; Conversion efficiency; Electric generators; Energy conversion; Forestry; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Heat treatment; Leakage (fluid); Smoke; Waste incineration; carbon; carbon dioxide; fuel; nitrogen oxide; plastic; combustion; electricity generation; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; global warming; greenhouse gas; incineration; waste management; air pollution; chemical composition; combustion; downstream processing; electricity; energy conservation; energy consumption; energy cost; energy resource; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; incineration; priority journal; review; waste management; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Incineration; Nitrous Oxide",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Astrup, T., (2008) Management of APC Residues from W-t-E Plants.
