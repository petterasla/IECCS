Vegetation change could occur through drought-induced dieback and fire. The direct combustion of vegetation and the decay of dead biomass could result in a release of carbon from the biosphere to the atmosphere over a 50- to 150-year time frame. A simple model that tracks dieback and regrowth of extra-tropical forests is used to estimate the possible magnitude of this carbon pulse to the atmosphere. Depending on the climate scenario and model assumptions, the carbon pulse could range from 0 to 3 Gt of C yr-1. The wide range of pulse estimates is a function of uncertainties in the rate of future vegetation change and in the values of key model parameters. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; climate change; transient response; vegetation; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide - Environmental Impact; Meteorology - Climatology; Carbon Pulse; Forest Dieback; Global Climate Change; Vegetation Change; Forestry; carbon; carbon dioxide; air pollution; atmosphere; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; nonhuman; vegetation",,,,,,"Allen, L.H., Jr., Plant responses to rising carbon dioxide and potential interactions with air pollutants (1990) J.
