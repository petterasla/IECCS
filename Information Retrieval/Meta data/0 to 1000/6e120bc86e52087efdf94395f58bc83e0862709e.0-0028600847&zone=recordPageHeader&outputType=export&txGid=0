It then rose up to the 1950s (by 0.6°C). A subsequent slight fall in temperature lasted until the mid 1970s. Since then a further rise has been observed (0.6-0.9°C). Temperatures in the upper horizons of permafrost over the last 10-20 years are in good agreement with recent global warming trends. For the European north-east during the period 1970-90 a rise in temperature at a depth of 3 m amounted to 0.6-0.7°C on average. However, this is related not necessarily to a rise in air temperature, but more likely to an increase in snow cover. -Author",,"climate change; meteorological measurement; permafrost; snow cover; Russian Federation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028600847
