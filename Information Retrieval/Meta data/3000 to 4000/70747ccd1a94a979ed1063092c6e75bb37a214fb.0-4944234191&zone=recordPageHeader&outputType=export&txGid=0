Juni 136, 10623 Berlin, Germany","Concern has been expressed that anthropogenic climate change may lead to a slowdown or even collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). Because of the possibly severe consequences that such an event could have on the northern North Atlantic and northwestern Europe, integrated assessment models (IAMs) are needed to explore the associated political and socioeconomic implications. State-of-the-art climate models representing the THC are, however, often too complex to be incorporated into an integrated assessment framework. In this paper we present a low-order model of the Atlantic THC which meets the main requirements of IAMs: it (1) is physically based, (2) is computationally highly efficient, (3) allows for comprehensive uncertainty analysis and (4) can be linked to globally aggregated climate models that are mostly used in IAMs. The model is an interhemispheric extension of the seminal Stommel model. Its parameters are determined by a least-squares fit to the output of a coupled climate model of intermediate complexity. Results of a number of transient global warming simulations indicate that the model is able to reproduce many features of the behaviour of coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation models such as the sensitivity of the THC to the amount, regional distribution and rate of climate change.","Box model; Climate change; Sensitivity analysis; Thermohaline circulation","Computer simulation; Diffusion; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Oceanography; Sensitivity analysis; Box model; Diffusion coefficients; Diffusive fluxes; Thermohaline circulation (THC); Climate change",,,,,,"Dansgaard, W., Johnsen, S., Clausen, H., Dahl-Jensen, N., Gundestrup, N.S., Hammer, C., Hvidberg, C., Bond, G., Evidence for general instability of past climate from a 250-kyr ice-core record (1993) Nature, 364, pp. 218-220; Dixon, K., Delworth, T., Spelman, M., Stouffer, R., The influence of transient surface fluxes on North Atlantic overturning in a coupled GCM climate-change experiment (1999) Geophys Res Let (2), 17, pp. 2749-2752; Ganachaud, A., Wunsch, C., Improved estimates of global ocean circulation, heat transport and mixing from hydrographic data (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 453-457; Ganopolski, A., Petoukhov, V., Rahmstorf, S., Brovkin, V., Claussen, M., Eliseev, A., Kubatzki, C., CLIMBER-2: A climate system model of intermediate complexity, part II (2001) Model Sensitivity.
