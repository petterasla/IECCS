The decline of populations or species, an accelerating trend worldwide, can lead to simplification of ecosystem processes, thus threatening the stability and sustainability of ecosystem services directly relevant to human welfare in the chain of economic and ecological relationships. The challenge of addressing issues of such enormous scope and complexity has highlighted the limitations of ecology-as-science. Additionally, biosphere-scale conflicts seem to lie beyond the scope of conventional economics, leading to differences of opinion about the commodity value of biodiversity and of the services that intact ecosystems provide. In the face of these uncertainties, many scientists and economists have adopted principles that clearly assign burdens of proof to those who would promote the loss of biodiversity and that also establish 'near trump' (preeminent) status for ecological integrity. Electric utility facilities and operations impact biodiversity whenever construction, operation, or maintenance of generation, delivery, and support facilities alters landscapes and habitats and thereby impacts species. Although industry is accustomed to dealing with broad environmental concerns (such as global warming or acid rain), the biodiversity issue invokes hemisphere-wide, regional, local, and site-specific concerns all at the same time. Industry can proactively address these issues of scope and scale in two main ways: first, by aligning strategically with the broad research agenda put forth by informed scientists and institutions; and second by supporting focused management processes whose results will contribute incrementally to the broader agenda of rebuilding or maintaining biodiversity.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem management; Electric utilities; Environmental economics; Research","Biodiversity; Environmental economics; Acid rain; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Global warming; Public policy; Electric utilities; biodiversity; conference paper; economics; ecosystem; environmental management; industry; nuclear power plant; power supply; research; resource management",,,,,,"Barker, J.R., Tingey, D.T., (1992) Air Pollution Effects on Biodiversity, , Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York; Bishop, R.C., Economic efficiency, sustainability, and biodiversity (1990) Ambio, 22 (2-3), pp. 69-73; Bodansky, K., Commentary: The precautionary principle (1992) Environment, 34, p. 4; Breece, G.A., Ward, B.J., Utility terrestrial biodiversity issues (1996) Environmental Management, 20, pp. 799-803; Cairns Jr., J., Quantification of biological integrity (1977) Integrity of Water, pp. 171-187. , R.
