We have incorporated General Circulation Model-based scenarios of anthropogenic global climate change in an integrated linked-system model for predicting changes in malaria epidemic potential in the next century. The concept of the disability-adjusted life years is included to arrive at a single measure of the effect of anthropogenic climate change on health impact of malaria. Assessment of the potential impact of global climate change of the incidence of malaria suggests a widespread increase of risk due to expansion of the areas suitable for malaria transmission. This predicted increase is most pronounced at the borders of endemic malaria areas and at higher altitudes within malarial areas. The incidence of infection is sensitive to climate changes in areas of Southeast Asia, South America, and parts of Africa where the disease is less endemic; in these regions the number of years of healthy life lost may increase significantly. However, the simulated changes in malaria risk must be interpreted on the basis of local environment conditions, the effect of socioeconomic developments, and malaria control programs or capabilities.","Climate change; Disability-adjusted life years; Integrated modeling approach; Malaria","article; climate; endemic disease; epidemic; global climate; malaria; mathematical model; mosquito; parasite; parasite vector; population model; prediction; priority journal; temperature; Animals; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Health; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Malaria; Models, Biological; Plasmodium; Risk Factors",,,,,,,"Martens, W.J.M.; Department of Mathematics, University of Limburg, PO Box 616, 6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",,,,,,,,00916765,,EVHPA,7656875,"English","ENVIRON.
