As population and economic activity increase, it will be necessary to implement national strategies that seek to balance the present needs and those of future generations. Multiple variables associated with agricultural crops, industries, and the impact of climate change, were incorporated into a Decision Support System (DSS). The DSS utilized Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which resulted in the prioritization of sustainable water policies for management in the Azraq Basin. The inputs to the DSS were generated through application of Modflow (groundwater), stochastic, and Penman Montieth models and through calculations of water productivity for agricultural and industrial sectors. The results of the DSS make recommendations as to how to enhance long-term sustainability of water resources in Azraq, while allowing for water utilization and economic growth. It is recommended for future planning that further research of the impacts to water resources must be conducted at local and national levels and linked to regional and global climate change prediction. It can be concluded that the DSS tool and AHP are potentially positive contributions to the process of decision- making for selection and ranking of alternatives and policies and for help in solving problems that include conflicting criteria.","Decision support system; Jordan; Management; Multi-criteria analysis; Sustainable water",,,,,,,"Al-Kharabsheh, A., (1995) Possibilities of Artificial Ground Recharge in the Azraq Basin: Potential Surface Water Utilization of Five Representative Catchment Areas (Jordan), , Helft, Germany: Herausgegeben Vom Leher- Und Forschungsbereich Hydrogeologie Und Umwelt der Universitat Wurzburg; Al-Jayyousi, O.R., Shatanawi, M.R., An analysis of future water policies in Jordan using decision support systems (1995) Journal of Water Resources Development, 11, pp. 315-330; (2000) Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change, , Published Report, Submitted to UNDP and The General Corporation for Environment Protection.
