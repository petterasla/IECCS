Hydrologically effective rainfall is predicted from temperature and precipitation for each season based on site specific formulae developed using the Meteorological Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System (MORECS) and UK Surface Water Archive databases. Comparisons are then made between the effects predicted for the scenarios established from equilibrium simulations and the new Hadley Centre High Resolution Model (UKHI) transient made results. Though very different, both suggest increased stress on water resources late in the hydrological year.","drought; global warming; seasonal flows; water management","Meteorological office rainfall and evaporation calculation system; Seasonal flows; Water management; Computer simulation; Database systems; Drought; Environmental impact; Global warming; Hydrology; Rain; Water supply; Water resources",,,,,,,"Holt, C.P.; School of Environmental Science, Nene College, Boughton Green Road, Northampton NN2 7AL, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,00431370,,WARBA,,"English","WATER RESOUR.
