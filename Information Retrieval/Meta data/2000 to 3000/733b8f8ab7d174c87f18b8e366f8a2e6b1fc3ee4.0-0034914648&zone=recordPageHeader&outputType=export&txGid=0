Ecosystem respiration during winter is important in this context because CO2 release from snow-covered tundra soils is a substantial component of annual net carbon (C) balance, and because global climate models predict that the most rapid rises in regional air temperature will occur in the Arctic during winter. In this manipulative field study, the relative contributions of plant and bulk soil organic matter C pools to ecosystem CO2 production in mid-winter were investigated. We measured CO2 efflux rates in Swedish sub-arctic heath tundra from control plots and from plots that had been clipped in the previous growing season to disrupt plant activity. Respiration derived from recently-fixed plant C (i.e., plant respiration, and respiration associated with rhizosphere exudates and decomposition of fresh litter) was the principal source of CO2 efflux, while respiration associated with decomposition of bulk soil organic matter was low, and appeared relatively insensitive to temperature. These results suggest that warmer mid-winter temperatures in the Arctic may have a much greater impact on the cycling of recently-fixed, plant-associated C pools than on the depletion of tundra bulk soil C reserves, and consequently that there is a low potential for significant initial feedbacks from arctic ecosystems to climate change during mid-winter.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Decomposition; Soils; Efflux rates; Ecosystems; arctic environment; carbon dioxide; climate change; feedback mechanism; respiration; soil organic matter; tundra soil",,,,,,"Alm, J., Saarnio, S., Nykänen, H., Silvola, S., Martikainen, P.J., Winter CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes on some natural and drained boreal peatlands (1999) Biogeochemistry, 44, pp. 163-186; Boone, R.D., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Canary, J.D., Kaye, J.P., Roots exert a strong influence on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (1998) Nature, 396, pp. 570-572; Brooks, P.D., Williams, M.W., Schmidt, S.K., Microbial activity under alpine snowpacks, Niwot Ridge, Colorado (1996) Biogeochemistry, 32, pp. 93-113; Cheng, W., Coleman, D.C., Effect of living roots on soil organic matter decomposition (1990) Soil Biol.
