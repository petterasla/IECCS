Manufacturing is one such activity that is poised to undergo significant changes for curbing green-house gas emissions. This paper presents schemes for reducing the energy consumed in machining and grinding operations - the workhorses of any typical manufacturing set-up. These schemes are based on the mechanics of the metal cutting process which have been well studied over the years. Besides lowering the energy drawn from national grids, such schemes will pave the way for improved energy-efficient manufacturing processes. In the foreseeable future, alternative fuel systems to power manufacturing processes together with both newer operations and schemes, such as those outlined in this effort, would have a positive impact on the energy consumption of the manufacturing sector. © Authors 2010.","global-warming; high-speed grinding; high-speed machining; manufacturing","Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Grinding operations; High speed machining; High-speed grinding; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; manufacturing; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing sector; Metal cutting process; National Grid; Alternative fuels; Cutting tools; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Industrial engineering; Manufacture; Metal cutting; Plastic deformation; Production engineering; Speed; Grinding (machining)",,,,,,"Pilat, D., Cimper, A., Olsen, K., Webb, C., The changing nature of manufacturing in OECD Economies OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers, No. 2006/9; Statistics for 2004, , European Environment Agency-European Union; Jeswiet, J., Kara, S., Carbon emissions and CES in manufacturing (2008) Annls CIRP, 57, pp. 17-20; Ivester, R.W., Kennedy, M., Davies, M., Stevenson, R., (2001) Assessment of Machining Models, Progress Report, , http://www.nist.gov/amm/, In official contribution of NIST on the website; Weinert, K., Inasaki, I., Sutherland, J.W., Wakabayashi, T., Dry machining and minimum quantity lubrication (2004) Annls CIRP, 53 (2), pp. 511-537; Seliger, G., (2008) Sustainability in Manufacturing, , Springer, Berlin; Westk̈amper, E., Alting, I., Arndt, G., Life cycle management: Approaches and visions towards sustainable manufacturing (2001) Proc.
