It argues that to date adjustments to energy policy have been made essentially at the margin, resulting in a number of policy tensions. The IEM proposals are based on a very narrow definition of efficiency and fail to address crucial areas like the promotion of renewable energy sources or end-use efficiency. Not all the implications are negative but incidental benefits hardly point to better integration. © 1993.","Energy policy; European Community; Global warming","emission reduction; environmental policy; European Community; global warming; internal energy market; policy development; Europe, (West)",,,,,,"IEA/OECD, (1989) Energy and the Environment: Policy Overview, , See for example, OECD, Paris; For a good account of these see ibidCEC, Resolution on the continuation and implementation of an EC policy and action programme on the environment (1987–1992) (1987) Official Journal of the EC, (328 C). , Vol 30; ECSC-EEC-EAEC, (1987) Treaties establishing the European Communities, , Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxemburg; CEC, (1992) Treaty on European Union, , Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxemburg; CEC, Council resolution concerning new Community energy policy for 1995 and convergence of the policies of the member states (1986) Official Journal of EC, (241 C), pp. 1-3; Collier, Hope, Owens, Integrating the Environment with Community Energy Policy (1989) Report to the Commission of the European Communities, , contract No B6611/B708-674-88; CEC, Communication from the Commission to the Council on energy and the environment (1990) COM (89) 369 final; IbidCEC, Communication to the Council, The Greenhouse Effect and the Community, and draft Council Resolution on the greenhouse effect and the Community (1988) COM (88) 656 final; H.I.
