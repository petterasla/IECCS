Box 173, N-0411 Oslo, Norway","Lakes in mountainous areas are of special interest in environmental studies because such lakes are generally particularly sensitive to inputs of atmospheric pollution and to changes in climate. Mountain lakes provide, therefore, an early warning of more widespread environmental changes. Surveys of lake-water chemistry in mountain areas in Norway, and mountain areas elsewhere in Europe which have crystalline bedrock, clearly show that such lakes are generally very dilute with low concentrations of base cations, alkalinity and SO4/2-. Mountain lakes also have low concentrations of total-P and TOC. The low concentrations of inorganic and organic ions are due to several factors of which low weathering rates, thin soils, high water fluxes and sparse vegetation in the catchment are of major importance. NO3/- concentrations on the other hand, are often higher in mountain lakes relative to low elevation lakes in the same area, due to the lower retention capacity of atmospherically deposited N in mountain catchments.",,"acid deposition; atmospheric pollution; climate change; lake water; mountain environment; water quality",,,,,,"Skjelkvåle, B.L., Henriksen, A., Faafeng, B., Fjeld, E., Traaen, T.S., Lien, L., Lydersen, E., Buan, A.K., Regional lake survey in Norway - Autumn 1995.
