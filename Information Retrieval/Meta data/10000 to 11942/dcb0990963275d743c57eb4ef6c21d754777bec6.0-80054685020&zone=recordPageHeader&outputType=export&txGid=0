These changes will cause transitions among coastal habitat types, which will be compounded by human-made barriers to the gradual inland migration of these habitat types. The effect of these changes on the future viability of coastal species will depend on the habitat requirements and population dynamics of these species. Thus, realistic assessments of the impact of SLR require linking geomorphological models with habitat and population models. In this study, we implemented a framework that allows this linkage, and demonstrated its feasibility to assess the effect of SLR on the viability of the Snowy Plover population in Florida. The results indicate that SLR will cause a decline in suitable habitat and carrying capacity for this species, and an increase in the risk of its extinction and decline. The model projected that the population size will decline faster than the area of habitat or carrying capacity, demonstrating the necessity of incorporating population dynamics in assessing the impacts of SLR on coastal species. The results were most sensitive to uncertainties in survival rate and fecundity, and suggested that future studies on this species should focus on the average and variability of these demographic rates and their dependence on population density. The effect of SLR on this species' viability was qualitatively similar with most alternative models that used the extreme values of each uncertain parameter, indicating that the results are robust to uncertainties in the model. This article is a US Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.","Charadrius alexandrinus; Climate change; Coastal land-cover; Demographic modeling; MaxEnt; Population viability analysis; RAMAS; SLAMM; Species distribution modeling","climate change; feasibility study; geomorphological response; global change; habitat quality; metapopulation; population decline; population density; population size; sea level change; wader; Florida [United States]; United States; Charadrius alexandrinus",,,,,,"Akçakaya, H.R., Estimating the variance of survival rates and fecundities (2002) Animal Conservation, 5, pp. 333-336; Akçakaya, H.R., (2005) RAMAS GIS: Linking Spatial Data with Population Viability Analysis, , Applied Biomathematics, Setauket, New York; Akçakaya, H.R., Raphael, M.G., Assessing human impact despite uncertainty: viability of the Northern Spotted Owl metapopulation in the northwestern USA (1998) Biodiversity and Conservation, 7, pp. 875-894; Akçakaya, H.R., Stark, J.D., Bridges, T.S., (2008) Demographic Toxicity: Methods in Ecological Risk Assessment, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Anderson, B.J., Akçakaya, H.R., Araújo, M.B., Fordham, D.A., Martinez-Meyer, E., Thuiller, W., Brook, B.W., Dynamics of range margins for metapopulations under climate change (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276, pp. 1415-1420; Brook, B.W., Akçakaya, H.R., Keith, D.A., Mace, G.M., Pearson, R.G., Araujo, M.B., Integrating bioclimate with population models to improve forecasts of species extinctions under climate change (2009) Biology Letters, 5, pp. 723-725; Cahoon, D.R., Guntenspergen, G.R., Climate change, sea-level rise, and coastal wetlands (2010) National Wetlands Newsletter, 32, pp. 8-12; Chu-Agor, M.L., Muñoz-Carpena, R., Kiker, G.A., Emanuelsson, A., Linkov, I., Exploring sea-level rise vulnerability of coastal habitats through global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (2011) Environmental Modelling and Software, 26, pp. 593-604; Clough, J., Park, R.A., Fuller, R., (2010) SLAMM 6 Beta Technical Documentation: Release 6.0.1 Beta, , Warren Pinnacle Consulting, Inc., Warren, Vermont; Colwell, M., Millett, C., Meyer, J., Snowy Plover reproductive success in beach and river habitats (2005) Journal of Field Ornithology, 76, pp. 373-382; Colwell, M., McAllister, S., Millett, C., Philopatry and natal dispersal of the Western Snowy Plover (2007) Wilson Journal of Ornithology, 119, pp. 378-385; Colwell, M., Brindock, K., Burrell, N., (2008) Final Report: 2008 Snowy Plover Breeding in Coastal Northern California, Recovery Unit 2, , Submitted to MRB Research, Inc., Eureka, California; Convertino, M., Elsner, J.B., Muñoz-Carpena, R., Kiker, G.A., Martinez, C.J., Fischer, R.A., Linkov, I., Do tropical cyclones shape shorebird patterns?
