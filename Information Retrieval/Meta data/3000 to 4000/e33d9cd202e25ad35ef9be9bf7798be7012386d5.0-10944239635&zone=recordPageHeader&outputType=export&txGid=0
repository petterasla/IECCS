The rainwater acidity measurement have been conducted on a continuous basis for 20 years in the southern New Jersy Town of Westmont and Gibbstown. The process required that pH be converted to hydrogen ion concentration, the mean concentration computed by taking into account the amount of precipitation at each site, then converting back to pH. The pH of drinking water at the sites mentioned, has been monitored on a continuous bases during the period.",,"Aluminum; Carbon; Coastal zones; Combustion; Freezing; Ice; pH effects; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Thermal effects; Acid precipitation; Climatic stability; Hydroelectric plants; Weak acids; Global warming",,,,,,"Bindschadler, R., Bentley, C., On thin ice (2002) Sci Amer, 287 (6), pp. 98-105; Hileman, B., Climate change (2001) Chem Eng News, 79 (9), p. 10; Warm arctic sum mer melted much ice (2002) Sci News, 162 (25-26), p. 400; Thompson, L.G., Mosley-Thompson, E., Davis, M.E., Kilimanjaro ice core records: Evidence of halocene climate change in tropical (2002) Africa.
