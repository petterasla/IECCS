Assessment of the biological response to future climate change is based mainly on large-scale models. Whole-ecosystem experiments provide one of the few available tools by which ecosystem response can be measured and with which global models can be evaluated. Boreal ecosystem response to global change may be manifest by alterations in nitrogen (N) dynamics, as N is often the growth limiting nutrient. The CLIMEX (Climate Change Experiment) project entails catchment-scale manipulations of CO2 (to 560 ppmv) and temperature (by +3 to +5°C) to whole forest ecosystems in southern Norway. Soil warming at EGIL catchment caused an increase in nitrate and ammonium concentrations in runoff in the first year of treatment. The authors hypothesize that higher temperature increased N release by mineralization.",,"boreal forest; global warming; nitrogen; nitrogen mineralization; soil temperature; Norway",,,,,,,"Lukewille, A.; NICA, PO Box 173, N-0411 Oslo, Norway",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031435731
