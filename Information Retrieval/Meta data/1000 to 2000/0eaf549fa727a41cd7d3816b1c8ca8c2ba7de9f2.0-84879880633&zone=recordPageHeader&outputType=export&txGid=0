Inst./Stt. Univ., Blacksburg, VA 24061, United States","The character and relative stratigraphic position of paleoclimatic indicators within Upper Mississippian strata of southern West Virginia suggest a link between eustasy and patterns of continental- to global-scale atmospheric circulation. At the cyclothem scale, annual rhythms in marine facies, and paleovertisols and lacustrine carbonates in terrestrial units indicate that seasonal, semiarid climatic conditions prevailed during highstand progradation. In contrast, leached paleosols and coals that underlie sequence boundaries and occur within transgressive heterolithic facies are suggestive of humid climatic conditions during late highstand through early transgression. Milankovitch-band, glacial-interglacial cyclicity may explain both sequence development and the evidence for Late Mississippian climate fluctuations in the Appalachian basin. Shifts from seasonal to humid climatic conditions are attributed to systematic variation in monsoonal circulation, whereby seasonal moisture became restricted to the equatorial belt during the lowstands of each ~400 k.y. glacial-interglacial cycle.",,"atmospheric circulation; climate change; coal; eustacy; paleoclimate; paleosol; proxy climate record; United States",,,,,,"Algeo, T.J., Wilkinson, B.H., Periodicity of mesoscale phanerozoic sedimentary cycles and the role of Milankovitch orbital modulation (1988) Journal of Geology, 96, pp. 313-322; Beuthin, J.D., Paleopedological evidence for a eustatic Mississippian-Pennsylvanian (Mid-Carboniferous) unconformity in southern West Virginia (1997) Southeastern Geology, 37, pp. 25-27; Caudill, M.R., Driese, S.G., Mora, C.I., Preservation of a paleo-vertisol and an estimate of Late Mississippian paleoprecipitation (1996) Journal of Sedimentary Research, A66, pp. 58-70; Cecil, C.B., Paleoclimate controls on stratigraphic repetition of chemical and siliciclastic rocks (1990) Geology, 18, pp. 533-536; Cecil, C.B., Dulong, F.T., Edgar, N.T., West, R., Climatic controls on carboniferous cyclic sedimentation: U.S.A (1997) American Association of Petroleum Geologists Annual Meeting, 6, p. 19. , Abstract; Coulombe, C.E., Wilding, L.P., Dixon, J.B., Overview of vertisols: Characteristics and impacts on society (1996) Advances in Agronomy, 57, pp. 289-375; Crowell, J.C., Gondwanan glaciation, cyclothems, continental positioning, and climate change (1978) American Journal of Science, 278, pp. 1345-1372; Crowley, T.J., Yip, K.J.J., Baum, S., Moore, S.B., Modelling Carboniferous coal formation (1996) Palaeoclimates, 2, pp. 159-177; Driese, S.G., Caudill, M.R., Srinivasan, K., Late mississippian to early pennsylvanian paleokarst in east-central Tennessee: Field, petrographic, and stable isotope evidence (1998) Southeastern Geology, 37, pp. 189-204; Dunagan, S.P., Driese, S.G., Control of terrestrial stabilization on late devonian palustrine carbonate deposition Catskill Magnafacies, , in press, New York: Journal of Sedimentary Research; Francis, J.E., Palaeoclimates of Pangea-Geological evidence (1994) Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists Memoir, 17, pp. 5265-5274. , Embry, A.
