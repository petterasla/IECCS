The methodology, which embeds Life Cycle Analysis principles within a process optimization framework, involves proper definition of a consistent boundary around the process of interest, identification of the emissions inventory, quantification of environmental impact via proper metries (for air and water pollution, solid waste, global warming and ozone depletion) and inclusion of environmental criteria within process modelling and optimization tools. A case study, the production of VCM from ethylene, is presented to illustrate the basic features of MEIM. © 1995.","Environmental impact; pollution metrics; process optimization.; waste minimization","Air pollution; Chemical operations; Chemical plants; Environmental impact; Global warming; Optimization; Water pollution; Pollution metrics; Process optimization; Waste minimization; Computer simulation",,,,,,"Cohen, Allen, An Integrated Approach to Process Waste Minimization Research (1992) Jl. of Hazardous Materials, 29, pp. 237-253; Douglas, Process synthesis for waste minimization (1992) Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, 31, p. 43; Douglas, Process synthesis for waste minimization.
