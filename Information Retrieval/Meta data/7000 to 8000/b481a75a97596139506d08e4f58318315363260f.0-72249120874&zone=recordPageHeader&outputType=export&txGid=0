TGTRing model) derived from the trunk at 0.5, 1.3 and 2.5 m height. This model was applied to estimate the annual biomass and carbon accumulation of a plantation in Qianyanzhou Red-Soil Hill Comprehensive Development Experimental Station of CAS in Taihe County, Jiangxi Province (Abbr. Qianyanzhou). The results showed that the inflexion points of the biomass and carbon accumulation curves occur at 17 and 18 years of age, respectively, in masson pine, whilst both inflexion points occurred at 15 years in slash pine and Chinese fir. The biomass and carbon accumulation in Chinese fir proved to be greater in the last 20 years than in the other species, with 171.697 t/hm2 and 92.29 tc/hm2, respectively. masson pine, with a biomass of 133.84 t/hm2 and a carbon accumulation of 73.92 tc/hm2 was the lowest whilst slash pine was intermediate with a biomass of 147. 639 t/hm2 (unturpentined) and 135.743 t/hm2 (turpentined), and a carbon accumulation of 80. 18 tc/hm2 (unturpentined) and 73.72 tc/hm2 (turpentined). In 2006, the total biomass and carbon storage of the tree stratum of masson pine in Qianyanzhou was 3324.43 t and 14,156.64 tc, respectively, whilst the values for Chinese fir were 1326.97 t and 713.27 tc. For slash pine the total biomass was 14,156.64 t (unturpentined) and 13,015.97 t (turpentined), and the total carbon storage was 7 688.21 tc (unturpentined) and 7068.78 tc (turpentined). Following the shaving of slash pine for resin, the total biomass was reduced by 1140.67 t and the total carbon storage fell by 619.43 tc. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Biomass; Carbon accumulation; Plantation; Qianyanzhou; TGTRing model; Tree-ring",,,,,,,"Acker, S.A., Halpern, C.B., Harmon, M.E., Trends in bole biomass accumulation, net primary production and tree mortality in Pseudotsuga menziesii forest of contrasting age (2002) Tree Physiology, 22, pp. 213-217; Alexeyev, V., Birdsey, R., Stakanov, V., Carbon in vegetation of Russian forests: Methods to estimate storage and geographical distribution (1995) Water, Air and Soil Pollution, 82, pp. 271-282; Baldocchi, D., Falge, E., Gu, L.H., FLUXNET: A new tool to study the temporal and spatial variability of ecosystem scale carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy flux densities (2001) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 82, pp. 2415-2434; Biondi, F., Comparing tree-ring chronologies and repeated timber inventories as forest monitoring tools (1999) Ecological Applications, 9 (1), pp. 216-227; Bonan, G.B., Land-atmosphere interaction for climate system models: Coupling biophysical, biogeochemical, and ecosystem dynamical processes (1995) Remote Sensing of Environment, 51, pp. 57-73; Bouriaud, O., Bréda, N., Dupouey, J., Is ring width a reliable proxy for stem-biomass increment?
