In the automotive industry, R-134a refrigerant is widely used in air conditioning systems because it has zero ozone depletion potential (ODP). Unfortunately, its global warming potential (GWP) is high. Therefore, alternative refrigerants are needed as a replacement for R-134a. R-152a is considered to be one of the better alternative refrigerants due to zero ODP and low GWP. In this paper, the performance of an automotive air conditioning system using R-134a and one using R-152a are compared experimentally at the bench level. The experimental apparatus simulated a real automotive air conditioning system consisting of a cabin and engine room structure. The cooling capacity, condensing capacity, coefficient of performance (COP) and power consumption characteristics of the automotive air conditioning system are evaluated by changing the air velocity entering the condenser and the compressor rotation speed with the optimized refrigerant charge amount. Also, the performance of the R-152a system was investigated by changing the thermostatic expansion valve which is set of values. The results of this study show that the R-152a system is slightly better than the R-134a system, not only under driving conditions but also under idling condition. R-152a refrigerant thus shows promise as an alternative refrigerant to replace the current standard, R-134a, in automotive air conditioning systems. © 2009 The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg GmbH.","Alternative refrigerant; Automotive air-conditioning system; COP (Coefficient of Performance); GWP (Global Warming Potential); ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential); Refrigerant charge quantity",,,,,,,"Baker, J.A., R-152a refrigeration system for mobile air conditioning (2003) SAE Paper No. 2003-01-0731; Ghodbane, M., Baker, J.A., Kadle, P.S., Potential applications of R-152a refrigerant in vehicle climate control part II (2004) SAE Paper No. 2004-01-0918; Ghodbane, M., An investigation of R-152a and hydrocarbon refrigeration in mobile air conditioning (1999) SAE Paper No. 1999-01-0874; A Brief Analysis of the Kyoto Protocol (1997) Global Environment Change Report, 9, p. 24; Hill, W., Papasavva, S., Life cycle analysis framework; A comparison of HFC-134a, HFC-134a enhanced, HFC-152a, R744, R744 enhanced and R290 automotive refrigerant systems (2005) SAE Paper No. 2005-01-1511; Kamei, A., Piao, C.C., Sato, H., Watanabe, K., (1990) Thermodynamic Charts and Cycle Performance of FC-134a and FC-152a, pp. 141-149. , PAP 00062; Lee, J.I., Kwon, I.W., Ha, O.N., A study on the characteristics an azeotropic mixture combined with CF3I and a refrigerant for air-conditioner HFC-152a and HFC-152a (2003) Int.
