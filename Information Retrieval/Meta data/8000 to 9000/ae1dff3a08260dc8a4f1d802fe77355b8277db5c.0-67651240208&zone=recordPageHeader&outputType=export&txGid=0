A fundamental question in coral reef ecology is whether chronic local stress reduces coral resistance and resilience from episodic stress such as bleaching, or alternatively promotes acclimatization, potentially increasing resistance and resilience. Here we show that following a major bleaching event, Montastraea faveolata coral growth rates at sites with higher local anthropogenic stressors remained suppressed for at least 8 years, while coral growth rates at sites with lower stress recovered in 2-3 years. Instead of promoting acclimatization, our data indicate that background stress reduces coral fitness and resilience to episodic events. We also suggest that reducing chronic stress through local coral reef management efforts may increase coral resilience to global climate change. © 2009 Carilli et al.",,"article; bleaching; chronic stress; climate change; controlled study; coral; coral reef; ecosystem resilience; environmental management; environmental protection; growth inhibition; growth rate; heat acclimatization; heat stress; Montastraea faveolata; nonhuman; animal; Anthozoa; climate; dinoflagellate; growth, development and aging; physiological stress; physiology; symbiosis; Anthozoa; Dinophyceae; Montastraea faveolata; Animals; Anthozoa; Climate; Dinoflagellida; Stress, Physiological; Symbiosis",,,,,,"Harvell, C.D., Kim, K., Burkholder, J.M., Colwell, R.R., Epstein, P.R., Emerging marine diseases: Climate links and anthropogenic factors (1999) Science, 285, pp. 1505-1510; Hughes, T.P., Catastrophes, phase shifts, and large-scale degradation of a Caribbean coral reef (1994) Science, 265, pp. 1547-1551; Maragos, J.E., Impact of coastal construction on coral reefs in the US-affiliated Pacific islands (1993) Coast Manage, 21, pp. 235-269; Knowlton, N., The future of coral reefs (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 98, pp. 5419-5425; Hughes, T.P., Baird, A.H., Bellwood, D.R., Card, M., Connolly, S.R., Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs (2003) Science, 301, pp. 929-933; Knowlton, N., Jackson, J.B.C., Shifting baselines, local impacts, and global change on coral reefs (2008) PLoS Biol, 6, pp. 215-220; Sandin, S.A., Smith, J.E., DeMartini, E.E., Dinsdale, E.A., Donner, S.D., (2008) Baselines and degradation of coral reefs in the northern Line Islands, ONE 3, pp. e1548. , PLoS; Brown, B.E., Dunne, R.P., Goodson, M.S., Douglas, A.E., Experience shapes the susceptibility of a reef coral to bleaching (2002) Coral Reefs, 21, pp. 119-126; Castillo, K.D., Helmuth, B.S.T., Influence of thermal history on the response of Montrastrea annularis to short-term temperature exposure (2005) Mar Biol, 148, pp. 261-270; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Climate change, coral bleaching, and the future of the world's coral reefs (1999) Mar Freshw Res, 50, pp. 839-866; Leder, J.J., Szmant, A.M., Swart, P.K., The effect of prolonged ""bleaching"" on skeletal banding and stable isotopic composition in Montastrea annularis (1991) Coral Reefs, 10, pp. 19-27; Suzuki, A., Gagan, M.K., Fabricius, K., Isdale, P.J., Yukino, I., Skeletal isotope microprofiles of growth perturbations in Porites corals during the 1997-1998 mass bleaching event (2003) Coral Reefs, 22, pp. 357-369; Goreau, T., Macfarlane, A.H., Reduced growth rate of Montastrea annularis following the 1987-88 coral-bleaching event (1990) Coral Reefs, 8, pp. 211-215; De'ath, G., Lough, J.M., Fabricius, K.F., Declining coral calcification on the Great Barrier Reef (2009) Science, 323, pp. 116-120; Kramer, P., Kramer, P.R., Arias-Gonzalez, E., McField, M., Status of coral reefs of northern Central America: Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador (2000) Status of Coral Reefs of the World, , Wilkinson C, ed, Townsville: Australian Institute for Marine Science; Halpern, B.S., Walbridge, S., Selkoe, K.A., Kappel, C.V., Micheli, F., A Global map of human impact on marine ecosystems (2008) Science, 319, pp. 948-952; An Evaluation of Ecosystem Health Healthy Reefs Initiative (2008) Eco-health Report Card for the Mesoamerican Reef, , http://www.healthyreefs.org; McField, M.D., Influence of disturbance on coral reef community structure in Belize (2000) Proc 9th Int Coral Reef Symp, 1, pp. 62-68; Knutson, R.A., Buddemeier, R.W., Smith, S.V., Coral chronometers: Seasonal growth bands in reef corals (1972) Science, 177, pp. 270-212; Helmle, K.P., Kohler, K.E., Dodge, R.E., (2002) Coral X-radiography Densitometry System, , http://www.nova.edu/ocean/coralxds/index.html; Edinger, E., Limmon, G.V., Jompa, J., Widjatmoko, W., Heikoop, J.M., Normal coral growth rates of dying reefs: Are coral growth rates good indicators of reef health?
