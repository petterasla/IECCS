We show, using both experimental results and theoretical analysis, that one such experiment demonstrates an entirely different phenomenon: The greater density of carbon dioxide compared to air reduces heat transfer by suppressing convective mixing with the ambient air. Other related experiments are subject to similar concerns. Argon, which has a density close to that of carbon dioxide but no infrared absorption, provides a valuable experimental control for separating radiative from convective effects. A simple analytical model for estimating the magnitude of the radiative greenhouse effect is presented, and the effect is shown to be very small for most tabletop experiments. © 2010 American Association of Physics Teachers.",,,,,,,,"Lueddecke, S.B., Pinter, N., McManus, S.A., Greenhouse effect in the classroom: A project- and laboratory-based curriculum (2001) J.
