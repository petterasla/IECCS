Over the course of the integrations, there is a general decrease in the number of cyclone events in both the northern and the southern hemispheres. Although the total number of cyclone events decreases, the number of intense events in both hemispheres increases. The relation between the low-level temperature field and the total number of events as well as the relation between precipitation and intense events are discussed. © Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society.",,"climate change; cyclone; global warming; modeling; winter",,,,,,"Boer, G.J., Mcfarlane, N.A., Lazare, M., Greenhouse gas-induced climate change simulated with the CCC second generation general circulation model (1992) J.
