In the warming climate, the EASM rainfall is totally projected to increase, while the rainfall over the northern part of the Korean Peninsula is projected to decrease with a slight southward movement of the monsoonal band. In relation to the Changma, the principal mode of the annual structure of precipitation exhibits a remarkable change between the present-day and future climate, representing to some extent a longer period of rainfall. The westward extension of the enhanced western North Pacific subtropical high and the enhanced atmospheric moisture content due to warming are responsible for the increase in the EASM rainfall. Change in extreme precipitation represented by the extreme climate index (i.e., P20) shows a clear increase for all of the Meiyu, Changma and Baiu. The convective instability is suggested as one of the primary source affecting the change in precipitation.","Climate change; East Asian Summer Monsoon; Extreme climate; Precipitation",,,,,,,"Adler, R.F., The version 2 Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly precipitation analysis (1979-Present) (2003) J.
