The prospect is of particular concern at the local and regional levels, since vulnerability and adaptive capacity are location-specific and many decisions regarding climate-induced risks are made at those levels. In this light, one is compelled to survey stakeholders' understandings of their situation and perceived problems. Assessments should also include the context of other ongoing changes, such as globalisation, that will impact communities and exacerbate their vulnerabilities. This paper presents an assessment of vulnerability and adaptive capacity in the forestry sector in the Pite River basin in northern Sweden. The study was carried out using a multi-method design encompassing literature surveys, interviews with stakeholders, and stakeholder meetings. The paper concludes that while climate change will have an impact on the region, its effect will be superseded by that of broader socio-economic changes. The results illustrate the need to understand local and regional perceptions of adaptation in formulating appropriate policy measures. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Economic and social effects; Problem solving; Risk assessment; Rivers; Multi-method design; Policy measures; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; forestry; globalization; stakeholder; vulnerability; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Pite Basin; Scandinavia; Sweden",,,,,,"Beniston, M., Innes, J.L., Beniston, M., Innes, J.L., Impacts of climatic variability and extremes on forests: Synthesis (1998) The Impacts of Climate Variability on Forests, , Springer-Verlag Berlin; Bostrom, A., Morgan, M.G., Fischhoff, B., Read, D., What do people know about global climate change? 1.
