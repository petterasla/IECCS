It has been argued that the cost of taking smart, effective cooperative action towards reducing global warming should be manageable. Following an effective approach, our work investigates the scenario of environmental sustainability in Malaysia and reassesses energy policy and alternative energy sources such as the utilization of oil palm (that is as a source of renewable energy) to reduce the economic and environmental burden. Our efforts try to lessen the gap between greenhouse gas mitigation and sustainable development, focusing on changing conventional energy instruments. This paper may be useful in the formulation of policies on renewable energy in Malaysia and possibly elsewhere. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Energy; Energy policy; Environmental impacts; Palm oil bio-diesel; Renewable energy","Elaeis",,,,,,"Al-Amin, A.Q., Mazharul, I., Yap, S.F., Fatimah, K., An alternate approach to identify key service sectors' contributors: Experiences from Malaysian economy (2010) Afr.
