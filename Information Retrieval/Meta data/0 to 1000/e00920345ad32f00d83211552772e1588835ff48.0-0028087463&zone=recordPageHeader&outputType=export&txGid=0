The current proposals to control emissions slow but do not end the build-up of concentrations, and they could imply costly short-term adjustments of the energy industries. Our objective is to explore an alternative policy that could (1) stabilize induced climate change, (2) provide for the creation of international `property rights' in the stratosphere by means of tradable emission permits, and (3) be more intertemporally cost-effective. Our method for analyzing this effort is a tested, dynamic, price sensitive, global economic model to which is linked a climate change submodel. Together these models enable us to project price and quantity time paths of energy, climate, and tradable permit variables under alternative policy actions.",,"Air pollution control; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Industrial economics; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Marketing; Mathematical models; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions; International property rights; Tradable emission permits; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,,"Kosobud, Richard F.; Univ of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, United States",,,"Publ by IAEE, Cleveland, OH, United States",,,,,01956574,,ENJOD,,"English","Energy J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028087463
