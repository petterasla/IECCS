Simulations of these policies show that participating industrialized countries can reduce their costs and hence increase their willingness to participate. However, they will impose higher costs on the world, because the most carbon-intensive fuels will not be taxed most heavily. Such a bias creates a ""how"" inefficiency in addition to the ""where"" and ""when"" inefficiency created by current international agreements to control greenhouse gas emissions. Although countries have always had such incentives, these considerations must be more fully acknowledged in today's energy markets, after September 2001. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Energy security; Global climate change","Energy policy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Carbon intensity; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; energy market; energy policy",,,,,,"Brown, S.P.A., Huntington, H.G., Terms of trade and OECD policies to mitigate global climate change (2003) Economic and Financial Policy Review, , http://www.dallasfedreview.org, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; (1999), US Energy Information Administration, US Government Printing Office, Department of Energy, Washington, DC International Energy OutlookWeyant, J.P., Hill, J., The costs of the Kyoto protocol: A multi-model evaluation (1999) Energy Journal, (SPEC.
