This has led to the development of a mathematical model of the grazing dairy cow. The model, that embraces grass and grass white clover swards, has been used to assess the effects that the projected increases in temperature and rainfall under global warming and the increased levels of CO 2 might have on milk production and on silage conservation for a typical dairy farm. The results suggest that the impact on milk production for grass- based systems will vary depending on the locality. On the other hand, for herds grazed on grass white clover swards milk output might increase regardless of site, when the concentration of CO 2 is enhanced. As regards silage production from grass white clover swards, under global warming and at current levels of CO 2 there is an apparent tendency to increase the percentage of total silage yield obtained from the first cut, although this does not occur for grass swards. At the same time, there are also indications that global warming will increase the percentage of clover in the herbage cut for conservation.",,"agricultural impact; carbon concentration; climatic change; dairy farming; global warming; grassland management; grazing management; man-environment relations; milk yield; modelling approach; UK, Scotland; Bos taurus; Trifolium; Trifolium repens",,,,,,"(1980) The Nutrient Requirements of Ruminant Livestock, , Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, Farnham Royal, 351 pp; Bolin, B., Jager, J., Doos, B.R., The greenhouse effect, climatic change and ecosystems: A synthesis of present knowledge (1986) Scope 29.
