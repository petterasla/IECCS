The analysis suggested that temperatures cycle around a monotonically increasing, accelerating baseline with a period of ≈ 65 years and that the exponential growth rate of CO2 emissions varies inversely with this cycle. The Gaia hypothesis [5] suggests that the biosphere adjusts atmospheric greenhouse gases to maintain an optimal temperature for life. The previous analysis is here extended with a series of fitting exercises designed to demonstrate that the above described inverse relation represents a Gaian feedback. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Time series; Atmospheric greenhouse; Exponential growth rates; Exponentials; Global temperatures; Inverse relations; Least squares fit; Optimal temperature; Atmospheric temperature",,,,,,"Barnola, J.M., Raynaud, D., Korotkevich, Y.S., Lorius, C., Vostok ice core provides 160,000-year record of atmospheric CO2 (1987) Nature, 329, pp. 408-414; Jones, P.D., Moberg, A., Hemispheric and large-scale surface air temperature variations: An extensive revision and an update to 2001 (2003) Jour.
