Global warming of 3°C is predicted to cause the loss of 9-62% of the species inhabiting each mountain range and the extinction of three of 14 species throughout the region. -from Authors",,"climatic change; extinction; mammal fauna; mountain; species-area relationship; USA, (West), Great Basin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08888892,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027037593
