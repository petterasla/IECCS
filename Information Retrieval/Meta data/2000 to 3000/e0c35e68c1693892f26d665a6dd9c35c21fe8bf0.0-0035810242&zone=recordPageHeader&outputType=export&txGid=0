This approach requires a definition of trade-offs among the radiatively active gases. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has suggested global warming potentials for this purpose, which use the accumulated radiative forcing of each gas by a set time horizon to establish emission equivalence. But it has been suggested that this approach has serious shortcomings: damages or abatement costs are not considered and the choice of time horizon for calculating cumulative radiative force is critical, but arbitrary. Here we describe an alternative framework for determining emission equivalence between radiatively active gases that addresses these weaknesses. We focus on limiting temperature change and rate of temperature change, but our framework is also applicable to other objectives. For a proposed ceiling, we calculate how much one should be willing to pay for emitting an additional unit of each gas. The relative prices then determine the trade-off between gases at each point in time, taking into account economical as well as physical considerations. Our analysis shows that the relative prices are sensitive to the lifetime of the gases, the choice of target and the proximity of the target, making short-lived gases more expensive to emit as we approach the prescribed ceiling.",,"Carbon monoxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; Kyoto protocol; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; sulfate; climate change; economic instrument; emission control; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; price dynamics; trade-off; article; cost; cost effectiveness analysis; force; gas; greenhouse effect; policy; priority journal; temperature",,,,,,"(1998) Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, , http://www.unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf, UNEP/INC/98/2, Information Unit for Conventions, UNEP, Geneva; Schimel, D., (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, pp. 65-131. , (eds Houghton, J.
