This is one of the most productive ocean areas in the world, extremely rich in fishery resources with a total catch in excess of one million tons per annum. Marine life off the coast relies heavily on the nutrient-rich upwellings of the cold Benguela current. Warming events occur along this coast in association with many El Niños. These tremendously disrupt the coastal ecosystem, reducing productivity and devastating the anchovy and sardine fisheries. This article demonstrates for the first time the existence of a low-level atmospheric jet along the Benguela Coast of the southeastern Atlantic. Blowing parallel to the coast, this jet drives the coastal upwelling system and is part of a mechanism that links Pacific El Niño events to Southern Africa. The existence of such a jet has tremendous implications for the Benguela current and its response to climatic variability and change because a positive feedback exists between the intensity of this jet and the intensity of coastal upwelling. This may enhance the response of the Benguela Current Ecosystem to climatic variability, making it particularly susceptible to the impacts of global climate change. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",,"Benguela; Benguela currents; Climatic variability; Coastal ecosystems; Coastal upwelling; Fishery resources; Global climate changes; Integral part; Low level jet; Marine life; Positive feedback; Atmospheric movements; Coastal engineering; Ecosystems; Feedback; Fisheries; Landforms; Leakage (fluid); Nickel compounds; Ocean currents; Climate change; climate variation; El Nino; fishery production; global climate; jet flow; marine ecosystem; nutrient enrichment; upwelling; Atlantic Ocean; Benguela Current; Engraulidae",,,,,,"Bakun, A., Global climate change and intensification of coastal ocean upwelling (1990) Science, 247, pp. 198-201; Balas, N., Nicholson, S.E., Klotter, D., The relationship of rainfall variability in West central Africa to sea-surface temperature fluctuations (2007) Int J Climatol, 27, pp. 1335-1349; Beardsley, R.C., Dorman, C.E., Friehe, C.A., Rosenfield, L.K., Winant, C.D., Local atmospheric forcing during the Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment I: A description of the marine boundary layer and atmospheric conditions over a northern California upwelling region (1987) J Geophys Res, 92, pp. 1467-1488; Binet, D., Gobert, B., Maloueki, L., El Niño-like warm events in the Eastern Atlantic (6° N, 20° S) and fish availability from Congo to Angola (1964-1999) (2001) Aquat Living Resour, 14, pp. 99-113; Bourassa, M.A., Legler, D.M., O'Brien, J.J., Smith, S.R., SeaWinds validation with research vessels (2003) J Geophys Res, 108, p. 3019. , doi:10.1029/2001JC001081; Burk, S.D., Thompson, W.T., The summertime low-level jet and marine boundary layer structure along the California coast (1996) Mon Weather Rev, 124, pp. 668-686; Carton, J.A., Huang, B., Warm events in the tropical Atlantic (1994) J Phys Oceanogr, 24, pp. 888-903; Colberg, F., Reason, C.J.C., Rodgers, K., South Atlantic response to El Niño-Southern oscillation induced climate variability in an ocean general circulation model (2004) J Geophys Res, , doi:10.1029/2004JCO02301; Covey, D.L., Hastenrath, S., The Pacific El Niño phenomenon and the Atlantic circulation (1978) Mon Weather Rev, 106, pp. 1280-1286; Delecluse, P., Servain, J., Levy, C., Arpe, K., Bengsston, L., On the connection between the 198 Atlantic warm event and the 1982-1983 ENSO (1994) Tellus, 46 a, pp. 448-464; Douglas, M.W., The summertime low-level jet over the gulf of California (1995) Mon Weather Rev, 123, pp. 2334-2347; Findlater, I., A major low-level air current near the Indian Ocean during the northern summer (1969) Q J R Meteorol Soc, 95, pp. 362-380; Florenchie, P., Reason, C.J.C., Lutjeharms, J.R.E., Evolution of interannual warm and cold events in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean (2004) J Cimate, 17, pp. 2318-2334; Gammelsrød, T., Bartholomae, C.H., Boyer, D.C., Filipe, V.L.L., O'Toole, M.J., The 1995 Benguela Niño (1998) S Afr J Mar Sci, 19, pp. 41-56; Giannini, A., Saravanan, R., Chang, P., Oceanic forcing of Sahel rainfall on interannual to interdecadal time scales (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1027-1030; Goddard, L., Graham, N.E., Importance of the Indian Ocean for simulating rainfall anomalies over eastern and southern Africa (1999) J Geophys Res, 104 (D16), pp. 19,099-19,116; Grist, J.P., Nicholson, S.E., A study of the dynamic factors influencing the interannual variability of rainfall in the West African Sahel (2001) J Climate, 14, pp. 1337-1359; Grodsky, S.A., Carton, J.A., Nigam, S., Near surface westerly wind jet in the Atlantic ITCZ (2003) Geophys Res Lett, 30, p. 2009. , doi:10:1029/2003GL017867; Höflich, O., Climate of the South Atlantic Ocean (1984) Climates of the Oceans, 15, pp. 1-195. , World survey of climatology, H.
