Although C 2F4 gas has a very low Global Warming Potential (GWP &lt; 1), it is very unstable and thus considerably difficult to handle. This gas is used in the semiconductor manufacture process, where it is obtained from a conventional high-pressure cylinder. By changing the output of the laser, the amount of C2p4 gas generated can be precisely controlled in this equipment while also ensuring safety. The gas is supplied to the VHF excited parallel plate plasma reactor through a gas shower head with Ar carrier gas and, in actual tests, this environmental benign technology achieved high etching performances for low-k SiOCH and SiO2 films. ©2005 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","An alternative gas; C2F4; Etching; GWP; SiO2; SiOCH; The cleaning process","Carbon dioxide lasers; Dielectric devices; Etching; Global warming; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Thin films; An alternative gas; C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>; GWP; SiO<sub>2</sub>; SiOCH; The cleaning process; Gas supply",,,,,,"Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB), U.S. National Library of Medicine (1999)Fujita, K., Ito, M., Hori, M., Goto, T., (1999) J.
