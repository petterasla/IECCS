England and Wales is a temperate region into which at least 38 freshwater fishes have been introduced, although 14 of these are no longer present. Of the remaining 24 species, some have persisted but failed to establish, some have established populations without becoming invasive and some have become invasive. The aim of the study was to predict the responses of these 24 non-native fishes to the warming temperatures of England and Wales predicted under climate change in 2050. The predictive use of climate-matching models and an air and water temperature regression model suggested that there are six non-native fishes currently persistent but not established in England and Wales whose establishment and subsequent invasion would benefit substantially from the predicted warming temperatures. These included the common carp Cyprinus carpio and European catfish Silurus glanis, fishes that also exert a relatively high propagule pressure through stocking to support angling and whose spatial distribution is currently increasing significantly, including in open systems. The potential ecological impacts of the combined effects of warming temperatures, current spatial distribution and propagule pressure on the establishment and invasion of C. carpio and S. glanis were assessed. The ecological consequences of C. carpio invasion were assessed as potentially severe in England and Wales, with impacts likely to relate to habitat destruction, macrophyte loss and increased water turbidity. However, evidence of ecological impacts of S. glanis elsewhere in their introduced range was less clear and so their potential impacts in England and Wales remain uncertain. © 2010 Crown copyright.","Cyprinus carpio; Global warming; Invasion pathway; Propagule pressure; Silurus glanis","Cyprinidae; Cyprinus carpio; Pisces; Silurus glanis",,,,,,"Billard, R., (1999) Carp Biology and Culture, , Springer-Praxis, Chichester, U.K; Bomford, M., Kraus, K., Barry, S.C., Lawrence, W., Predicting establishment success for alien reptiles and amphibians: a role for climate matching (2009) Biological Invasions, 11, pp. 713-724; Britton, J.R., Reference data for evaluating the growth of common riverine fishes in the UK (2007) Journal of Applied Ichthyology, 23, pp. 555-560; Britton, J.R., Davies, G.D., Ornamental species of the Acipenser genus: new additions to the ichthyofauna of the UK (2006) Fisheries Management & Ecology, 13, pp. 207-210; Britton, J.R., Davies, G.D., First UK recording in the wild of the bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (2007) Journal of Fish Biology, 70, pp. 1280-1282; Britton, J.R., Shepherd, J.S., Toms, S., Simpson, V., Recording of carp Cyprinus carpio in the diet of the otter Lutra lutra (2005) Fisheries Management & Ecology, 12, pp. 221-223; Britton, J.R., Boar, R.R., Grey, J., Foster, J., Lugonzo, J., Harper, D., From introduction to fishery dominance: the initial impacts of the invasive carp Cyprinus carpio in Lake Naivasha, Kenya, 1999 to 2006 (2007) Journal of Fish Biology, 71 D (SUPPL.), pp. 239-257; Buisson, L., Thuiller, W., Lek, S., Lim, P., Grenouillet, G., Climate change hastens the turnover of stream fish assemblages (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 2232-2248; Carol, J., Zamora, L., García-Berthou, E., Preliminary telemetry data on the patterns and habitat use of European catfish (Silurus glanis) in a reservoir of the River Ebro, Spain (2007) Ecology of Freshwater Fish, 16, pp. 450-456; Carol, J., Benejam, L., Benito, J., García-Berthou, E., Growth and diet of European cafish (Silurus glanis) in early and late invasion stages (2009) Fundamental and Applied Limnology, 174, pp. 317-328; Clarke, S., (2005) CCG Guide to UK Catfish Waters, , Hampshire, Charterlith; Copp, G.H., Fox, M.G., Growth and life history traits of introduced pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) in Europe, and the relevance to invasiveness potential (2007) Freshwater Bioinvaders: Profiles, Distribution, and Threats, pp. 289-306. , Gherardi F.
