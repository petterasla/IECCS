The correlation developed accurately works for temperatures between 260 and 450 K as well as pressures between 10 and 70 MPa which is the range of pressure that is widely considered in CO2 sequestration. Results have been compared with the reported data and excellent agreement has been obtained between the predicted results and observed values. The average absolute deviations were found to be 1.1 and 1.3% for viscosity and thermal conductivity of carbon dioxide respectively. Proposed simple predictive tool and can be of immense practical value for the engineers to have a quick check on the transport properties (namely viscosity and thermal conductivity) of carbon dioxide at various temperatures and pressures without performing any experimental measurements. In particular, personnel dealing with regulatory bodies of greenhouse gas control and process industries would find the proposed approach to be user friendly involving transparent calculations with no complex expressions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
