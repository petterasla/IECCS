Consequences for biodiversity may be severe, resulting in lowland attrition, range-shift gaps, range contractions and extinction risks. We aim to identify plant groups (growth forms, families, endemic status) with higher than average risks. Location: South Ethiopian highlands. Methods: Based on observational data from mainly unexplored and remote mountain regions, we applied a published model to project the consequences of an upward shift of thermal site conditions on the altitudinal distribution of 475 plant species. Annual average temperature increases of up to 5 °C were evaluated. Differences between groups of species were analysed by a permutation procedure and Generalized Linear Models. Results: Because of a limited regional species pool, even mild warming is projected to create strong potential risks concerning lowland attrition, i.e. the net loss of species richness because of upward range shifts in the absence of new species arriving. Likewise, many species are expected to face range-shift gaps, i.e. the absence of an overlap between future and current altitudinal ranges already under mild warming scenarios. Altitudinal contractions and mountain-top extinctions will potentially become important when warming exceeds 3.5 °C. Mean area per species is projected to decline by 55% for the A2 emissions scenario (+4.2 °C until 2100) because of the physical shape of the mountains. Higher than average vulnerability is expected for endemic species as well as for herbs and ferns. Plant families that are especially threatened are identified. Main conclusions: Lowland biotic attrition and range-shift gaps as predicted by a simple model driven by shifts of isotherms will result in novel challenges for preserving mountain biodiversity in the inner tropics. Whereas contractions of occupied area are expected to threaten endemic and already endangered species in particular, we suggest that conservation priorities can be identified based on simple prognostic models even without precise regional warming scenarios. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity loss; Climate change; Conservation biogeography; Range contraction; Range shift; Tropical high mountains","altitudinal zonation; biodiversity; climate effect; conservation management; ecological modeling; endangered species; endemic species; extinction risk; fern; global warming; herb; isotherm; mountain; new species; numerical model; phytogeography; range expansion; species richness; taxonomy; upland region; vulnerability; Ethiopia; Filicophyta",,,,,,"Ackerly, D.D., Loarie, S.R., Cornwell, W.K., Weiss, S.B., Hamilton, H., Branciforte, R., Kraft, N.J.B., The geography of climate change: implications for conservation biogeography (2010) Diversity and Distributions, 16, pp. 476-487; Adams, J., (2007) Vegetation-climate interaction: how vegetation makes the global environment, , Springer-Praxis Publishing, Chichester; Beckage, B., Osborne, B., Gavin, D.G., Pucko, C., Siccama, T., Perkins, T., A rapid upward shift of a forest ecotone during 40 years of warming in the Green Mountains of Vermont (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 105, pp. 4197-4202; Bewket, W., Conway, D., A note on the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall in the drought-prone Amhara region of Ethiopia (2007) International Journal of Climatology, 27, pp. 1467-1477; Bryan, E., Deressa, T.T., Gbetibouo, G.A., Ringler, C., Adaptation to climate change in Ethiopia and South Africa: options and constraints (2009) Environmental Science and Policy, 12, pp. 413-426; Bush, M.B., Distributional change and conservation on the Andean flank: a palaeoecological perspective (2002) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 11, pp. 463-473; Bush, M.B., Silman, M.R., Urrego, D.H., 48,000 years of climate and forest change in a biodiversity hot spot (2004) Science, 303, pp. 827-829; Bustarnante, M.R., Ron, S.R., Coloma, L.A., Changes in diversity of seven anuran communities in the Ecuadorian Andes (2005) Biotropica, 37, pp. 180-189; Chen, I.C., Shiu, H.J., Benedick, S., Holloway, J.D., Cheye, V.K., Barlow, H.S., Hill, J.K., Thomas, C.D., Elevation increases in moth assemblages over 42 years on a tropical mountain (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 106, pp. 1479-1483; Christensen, J.H., Hewitson, B., Busuioc, A., Chen, A., Gao, X., Held, I., Jones, R., Whetton, P., Regional climate projections (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
