The area covers Central and Northern Europe, adjacent sea-areas and Greenland. The GCM data were provided from the Max Planck Institute, Germany (MPI), the Hadley Centre, U.K. (HC), the Bjerknes Centre, Norway (BCCR) and University of Oslo, Norway (UiO). The resulting ensemble covers a range of future climate realizations from different global models, different greenhouse gas scenarios and natural climate variability. In order to present trends in statistical parameters including extreme events and their return periods, the downscaled response data are combined as an ensemble of equally valid possible realizations. The combined statistics is obtained after adjustments accounting for (i) different set-ups of the respective GCMs in producing the control climate and (ii) the variable range of time between the control and scenario periods. We find that annual extreme events of daily precipitation and wind speed in the control climate become more frequent in the scenario period over large areas in Northern Europe. The variability in the regional result appears sensitive to the phase of the Scandinavian pattern. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"climate change; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; extreme event; global climate; precipitation (climatology); wind velocity; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe",,,,,,"Ådlandsvik, B., Marine downscaling of a future climate scenario for the North Sea (2008) Tellus, 60 A; Allen, M.R., Stott, P.A., Mitchell, J.F.B., Schnur, R., Delworth, T.L., Quantifying the uncertainty in forecasts of anthropogenic climate change (2000) Nature, 407, pp. 617-620. , (Oct. 5); Benestad, R.E., Climate change scenarios for Northern Europe from multi-model IPCC AR4 climate simulations (2005) Geophys.
