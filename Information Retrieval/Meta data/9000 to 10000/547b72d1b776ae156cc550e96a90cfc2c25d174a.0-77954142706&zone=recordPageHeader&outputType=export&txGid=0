During the campaign period, the average observed concentrations of CH4 during the campaign period at the lower height (22.2m above ground level, agl) and upper height (27.5magl) were around 2.04ppm and 2.01ppm, respectively. It was noticed that the profile concentration of CH4 was lower during day time when compared to night time. However, the flux of CH4 was observed to be higher during the day time than during night hours. In order to understand the relationship between the influences of meteorological variables on the flux of CH4, six meteorological variables were studied. It was observed that soil heat flux has a linear positive correlation with the flux of CH4. During the study period, the maturity stage of rice paddy, the rice paddy ecosystem was behaving as sources of CH4 and CO2. Over a 100-year time frame, the global warming potential (GWP) fluxes of CH4 and CO2 observed at this study site were 0.16 and 0.71μmolCO2equivalentsm-2s-1, respectively. The total GWP flux (CH4 and CO2) was 0.86μmolCO2equivalentsm-2s-1 in which CH4 and CO2 contribute 18% and 82%, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Aerodynamic conductance; Eddy covariance; Flux-gradient; Methane flux; Rice paddy","aerodynamics; carbon dioxide; eddy covariance; global warming; methane; micrometeorology; paddy field; rice; Taiwan",,,,,,"Alberto, M., Carmelita, R., Wassmann, R., Hirano, T., Miyata, A., Kumar, A., Padre, A., Amante, M., CO2/heat fluxes in rice fields: Comparative assessment of flooded and non-flooded fields in the Philippines (2009) Agric.
