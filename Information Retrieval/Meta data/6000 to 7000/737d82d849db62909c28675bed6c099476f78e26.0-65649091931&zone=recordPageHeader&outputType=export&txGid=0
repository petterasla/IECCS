Unique to this study is an original relationship between soil moisture and the inertial number for soil particles. This numerical model can be applied to arbitrary soil slab profile configurations and to the analysis of natural disasters, such as mudslides, glacier creeping, avalanches, landslips, and other pyroclastic flows. Here the focus is on mudslides. The authors examine the effects of bed slope and soil slab thickness, soil layered profile configuration, soil moisture content, basal sliding, and the growth of vegetation, and show that increased soil moisture enhances instability primarily by decreasing soil strength, together with increasing loading. Moreover, clay soils generally require a smaller relative saturation than sandy soils for sliding to commence. For a stable configuration, such as a small slope and/or dry soil, the basal sliding is absorbed if the perturbation magnitude issmall. However, large perturbations can trigger significant-scale mudslides by liquefying the soil slab. The role of vegetation depends on the wet soil thickness and the spacing between vegetation roots. The thinner the saturated soil layer, the slower the flow, giving the vegetation additional time to extract soil moisture and slow down the flow. By analyzing the effect of the root system on the stress distribution, it is shown that closer tree spacing increases the drag effects on the velocity field, provided that the root system is deeper than the shearing zone. Finally, the authors investigated a two-layer soil profile, namely, sand above clay. A significant stress jump occurs at the interface of the two media.","Global warming; Granular flow rheology; Landslide","Constitutive relationships; Granular flows; Landslide risk analysis; Natural disasters; Pyroclastic flows; Saturated soils; Stable Configuration; Vegetation roots; Clay; Confined flow; Global warming; Landslides; Numerical models; Soil moisture; Stress concentration; Vegetation; Velocity; Granular materials",,,,,,"Allen, R., Pereira, L., Raes, D., Smith, M., Crop evapotranspiration (1998) Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements, , http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e0n.htm#TopOfPage, FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 Available online at; Baver, L., (1940) Soil Physics, p. 370. , John Wiley and Sons; Bolt, B., Horn, W., Macdonald, G., Scott, R., (1975) Geological Hazards: Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Volcanoes, Avalanches, Landslides, Floods, p. 328. , Springer-Verlag; Daerr, A., Douady, S., Two types of avalanche behaviour in granular media (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 241-243; Drucker, D.C., Prager, W., Soil mechanics and plastic analysis or limit design (1952) Quart.
