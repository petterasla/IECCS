These relationships are then validated by predicting daily temperatures using observed circulation and comparing the predicted values with the observed temperatures. The relationships predict surface temperature accurately over the major portion of the country in winter, and for half the country in summer. These relationships are then applied to the surface synoptic circulation of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies GCM control run, and a set of surface grid cell temperatures are generated. These temperatures, based on the larger-scale validated circulation, may now be used with greater confidence at the regional scale. The generated temperatures are compared to those of the model and show that the model has regional errors of up to 10°C in individual grid cells. -from Author",,"general circulation model; regional climate; surface; temperature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08948755,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028313810
