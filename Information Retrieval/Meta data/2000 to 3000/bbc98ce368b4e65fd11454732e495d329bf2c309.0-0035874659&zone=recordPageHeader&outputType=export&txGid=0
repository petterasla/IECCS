In this study, winter frequencies and intensities of extratropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere for the period 1959-97 are examined to determine if identifiable trends are occurring. Results indicate a statistically significant decrease in midlatitude cyclone frequency and a significant increase in high-latitude cyclone frequency. In addition, storm intensity has increased in both the high and midlatitudes. The changes in storm frequency correlate with changes in winter Northern Hemisphere temperature and support hypotheses that global warming may result in a northward shift of storm tracks in the Northern Hemisphere.",,"Atmospheric structure; Climatology; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Storms; frequency-magnitude distribution; global warming; Northern Hemisphere; tropical cyclone",,,,,,"Agee, E.M., Trends in cyclone and anticyclone frequency and comparison with periods of warming and cooling over the Northern Hemisphere (1991) J.
