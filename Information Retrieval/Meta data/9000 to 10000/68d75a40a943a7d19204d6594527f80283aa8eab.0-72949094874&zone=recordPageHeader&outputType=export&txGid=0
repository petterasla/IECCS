The SAR is a central tool in conservation, being used to predict species loss following global climate change, and is striking in its universality throughout different geographical regions and across the tree of life. In this article we draw upon the methods of quantum field theory and the foundation of neutral community ecology to derive the first spatially explicit neutral prediction for the SAR. We find that the SAR has three phases, with a power law increase at intermediate scales, consistent with decades of documented empirical patterns. Our model also provides a building block for incorporating non-neutral biological variation, with the potential to bridge the gap between neutral and niche-based approaches to community assembly. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Biodiversity; Ecological drift; Neutral theory; Spatial ecology; Species-area relationship; Stochastic models","biodiversity; biogeography; climate change; community ecology; ecological modeling; field method; niche; spatial analysis; species-area relationship; stochasticity; article; biodiversity; biological model; ecology; geography; population dynamics; Biodiversity; Ecology; Geography; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics",,,,,,"Aguiar, M.A.M., Baranger, M., Baptestini, E.M., Kaufman, L., Bar-Yam, Y., Global patterns of speciation and diversity (2009) Nature, 460, pp. 384-387; Allen, A.P., Gillooly, J.F., Assessing latitudinal gradients in speciation rates and biodiversity at the global scale (2006) Ecol.
