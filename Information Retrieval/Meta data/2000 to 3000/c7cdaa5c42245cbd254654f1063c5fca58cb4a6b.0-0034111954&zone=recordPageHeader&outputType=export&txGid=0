Altitude, which ranged from 550 m to 2120 m, accounted for most variation among wetlands, with an almost complete turnover of species along this gradient. Landform setting was less important in explaining overall species composition, but relationships of individual species were revealed (e.g. Eleocharis dregeana showed an affinity for depressions). Within a wetland there was an almost complete turnover of species along a gradient of wetness, as described using soil morphological criteria. Most species were consistently associated with the same wetness zones across different wetland sites, e.g., Phragmites australis with the wettest zone, Pycreus macranthus with the intermediate zone, and Eragrostis plana with the least wet zone. The occurrence and abundance of different photosynthetic pathway types depended on altitude and degree of wetness. At high altitudes, C 3 sedges, notably Carex acutiformis, dominated the wettest zone and C 3 and C 4 grasses and sedges dominated the intermediate and least wet zones. At mid altitudes, C 3 and C 4 sedges and C 3 grasses dominated the wettest zone, C 3 and C 4 grasses and sedges dominated the intermediate zone and C 4 grasses dominated the least wet zone. Low altitude sites showed a similar distribution of photosynthetic pathways as mid-altitude sites, but C 3 species were less abundant. Species richness was positively associated with the log of wetland size and, at the level of an individual wetland, species richness and evenness were found to be consistently greater in the intermediate and least wet zone compared with the wettest zone. The management implications of the results are discussed in the light of continuing anthropogenic loss of wetlands in the study area and global climate change.","Altitude; Diversity; Graminoid species composition; Hydrological regime; Photosynthetic pathways","altitude; community composition; species diversity; wetland; South Africa",,,,,,"Austin, M.P., Smith, T., A new model for the continuum concept (1989) Vegetatio, 83, pp. 35-47; Begg, G.W., The wetlands of Natal (Part 2): The distribution, extent and status of wetlands in the Mfolozi catchment (1988) Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission Report 71; Breen, C.M., Begg, G.W., Conservation status of South African wetlands (1989) Biotic Diversity in Southern Africa: Concepts of Conservation, , Huntley, B.
