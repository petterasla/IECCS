Time series of population abundance of barnacles, rock oysters and limpets revealed a variety of temporal cycles, trends and periods of instability. Analyses of three-year segments of these time series, equivalent to the length of field observations in a typical doctoral study, revealed only high-frequency seasonal cycles in abundance. Only 30% of the segments exhibited the 'correct' long-term trends, although the slopes were different, whereas coefficients of variability were generally underestimated, by as much as fourfold. Similarly, estimates of mean abundance were out by between two and four times. Multidimensional scaling ordinations of the entire species assemblage (approximately 12 species) revealed that the community occupies several distinct states, as defined by the relative abundance of component species. These states may persist for between 18 months and 5 years and in any three-year segment the community may change from one state to another, further confounding analyses from short time series. Although short-term experimental studies are useful, for example in elucidating species interactions, this analysis indicates that short-term studies of population abundance shed little light on long-term dynamics and cannot be used as reliable predictors of population variability. It is argued that an understanding of the dynamics of natural populations requires data at much larger temporal scales than those from most current studies. This necessitates long-term programmes which transcend the three- to five-year horizon. Given the indicators of global climate change, the sooner more such programmes are initiated, the better.",,"intertidal community; long-term change; population size; time series; South Africa; Animalia; Ostreidae; Patellidae; Thoracica",,,,,,"Maddock, L., Harbour, D.S., Boalch, G.T., Seasonal and year-to-year changes in the phytoplankton from the Plymouth area (1989) J.
