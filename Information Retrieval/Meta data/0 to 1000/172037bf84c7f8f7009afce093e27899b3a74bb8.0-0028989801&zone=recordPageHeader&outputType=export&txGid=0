The total area of reservoirs planned in the region is about 20 times the area existing in 1990, implying a potential annual methane release of about 5.2 million tons. About 40% of this estimated release is from underwater decay of forest biomass, which is the most uncertain of the components in the calculation. Methane is also released in significant quantities from open water, macrophyte beds, and above-water decay of forest biomass. Hydroelectric dams release a large pulse of carbon dioxide from above-water decay of trees left standing in the reservoirs, especially during the first decade after closing. This elevates the expected global warming impact of the dams to levels much higher than would occur by generating the same power from fossil fuels. -from Author",,"developing country; global warming; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric dam; pollution source; Brazil, Rio Grande; brazil; electric power plant; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; review; water supply",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028989801
