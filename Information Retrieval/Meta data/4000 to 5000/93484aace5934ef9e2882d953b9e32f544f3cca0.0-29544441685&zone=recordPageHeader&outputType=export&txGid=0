Because this population is the most exposed to the global warming effect, records of this population are likely to provide useful information on the response of this species to global warming. The aim of this study was to record the present status of this valuable population, enabling judgment of its sustainability. The density of successive F. crenata trees and saplings was low regardless of the coverage of dwarf bamboo. Moreover, the proportion of empty nuts observed was considerably high, suggesting to be the likely major factor limiting recruitment of saplings or successors in this population. Radial growth of F. crenata was shown to have been decreasing for the past 50 years, and there was a significantly negative correlation with the warmth index. The decreasing growth rate and poor regenerative ability caused by the high proportion of empty nuts suggest the possibility that this population will degrade further in the future, possibly being replaced by shrubs and small tree species. © The Japanese Forest Society and Springer-Verlag 2005.","Empty nuts; Fagus crenata; Southern limit of distribution","Bamboo; Global warming; Sustainable development; Empty nuts; Refugee population; Southern limit of distribution; Takakuma Mountains; Forestry; Bamboo; Fagus Crenata; Forests; Shrubs; Sustainable Forest Management; Fagus; Fagus crenata",,,,,,"Barber, V.A., Juday, G.P., Finney, B.P., Reduced growth of Alaskan white spruce in the twentieth century from temperature-induced drought stress (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 668-673; Hashizume, H., Yamamoto, S., Seed bearing of Beech trees (Fagus crenata Blume) in the Chugoku district of Japan (I). a survey of fruit bearing (in Japanese with English summary) (1974) J Jpn for Soc, 56, pp. 165-170; Hashizume, H., Yamamoto, S., Seed bearing of Beech trees (Fagus crenata Blume) in the Chugoku District of Japan (II). the fertility and character of seeds (in Japanese with English summary) (1974) J Jpn for Soc, 56, pp. 393-398; Homma, K., Akashi, N., Abe, T., Hasegawa, M., Harada, K., Hirabuki, Y., Irie, K., Yamanaka, N., Geographical variation in the early regeneration process of Siebold's Beech (Fagus crenata Blume) in Japan (1999) Plant Ecol, 140, pp. 129-138; Hukusima, T., Forest vegetation in Takakuma Mountains, specially reference on southern limit of distribution of Sasamorpho-Fagetum crenatae association (in Japanese) (1970) J Geobot, 18, pp. 47-57; (2004) Meterological Statistics, , http://www.data.kishou.go.jp; Kira, T., (1949) Forest Zones of Japan (In Japanese), p. 41. , Ringyo Gijutsu Kyokai Tokyo; Kira, T., Forest ecosysytem of east and southeast Asia in a global perspective (1991) Ecol Res, 6, pp. 185-200; Maruta, E., Kamitani, T., Seedling establishment of Fagus crenata Blume on the Pacific side of Japan I.
