Today the water heater market primarily uses the hydrochlorofluorocarbon blowing agent HCFC-141b. However, as a result of the Montreal Protocol, HCFC-141b is a transitional blowing agent, and must be replaced with ""third generation"" blowing agents by 2003. The next generation of blowing agents must have zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and low global warming potential (GWP). Additionally for the water heater market, the blowing agent must produce foams with low thermal conductivity. Water heaters must conform to energy requirements established by the Department of Energy. Future legislation is expected to impose stricter requirements on the energy efficiency of water heaters. In addition to low thermal conductivity, there are other desirable features of a blowing agent for water heater insulation systems. The blowing agent should be a liquid at room temperature, with a boiling point similar to those of CFC-11 and HCFC-141b. The blowing agent should be miscible with many different polyols and processable in existing foam equipment. It should be non-flammable and non-toxic. It should be reasonably priced and readily available. HFC-245fa has been identified as a primary candidate for a liquid, zero ODP blowing agent. The objective of this work was an evaluation of HFC-245fa in water heater insulation systems. Water heater foam systems using HFC-245fa were evaluated for stability, processability, physical properties, and energy performance. Results of these studies were compared to HFC-141b water heater foam systems.",,"Agents; Blow molding; Foamed plastics; Polyurethanes; Solubility; Thermal conductivity of liquids; Thermal insulation; Water heaters; Global warming potential; Polyols; Zero ozone depletion potential; Fluorocarbons",,,,,,"Williams, D.J., Bogdan, M.C., Parker, R.C., Knopeck, G.M., Update on the development of HFC-245fa as a liquid HFC blowing agent (1995) Proceedings of the Polyurethanes 1994 Conference; U.S. Patent 5,496,866 (Bayer AG)","McGee, I.E.; Bayer Corporation, 100 Bayer Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15205, United States",,,,,,,,0021955X,,JCUPA,,"English","J Cell Plast",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032028449
