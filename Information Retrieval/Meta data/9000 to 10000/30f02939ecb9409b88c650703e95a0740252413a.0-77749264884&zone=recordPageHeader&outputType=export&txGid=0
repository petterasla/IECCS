Adrop-in replacement hydrofluoroether has been evaluated using a gate-to-grave life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions for the trade-offs between direct and indirect carbon dioxide equivalent emissions compared to a current HFC and a historically used refrigerant. The results indicate current regulations being considered may increase global climate change. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide emissions; Current regulations; Global climate changes; Hydrofluorocarbons; Life-cycle assessments; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Inductively coupled plasma; Laws and legislation; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; fluorinated hydrocarbon; carbon dioxide; climate forcing; cooling; emission inventory; ether; global change; greenhouse gas; hydrofluorocarbon; life cycle analysis; pollution policy; regulatory framework; article; climate change; controlled study; environmental protection; freezing; global climate; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons; Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane; Climate Change; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Refrigeration; United States; United States",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Chlorofluorocarbons; Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated",,,,"(2009) Proposed Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, , EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0171.
