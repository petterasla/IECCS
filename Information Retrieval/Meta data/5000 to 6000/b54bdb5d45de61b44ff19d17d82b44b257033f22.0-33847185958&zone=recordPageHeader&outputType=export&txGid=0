This integrated study on the ecophysiological and individual morphological scale investigated the response, acclimation and adaptation of two desert shrubs, with different water-use strategies, to variations in water conditions. The experiments were carried out on two native dominant desert shrubs, Tamarix ramosissima and Haloxylon ammodendron, under three precipitation treatments (natural, double and no precipitation, respectively), in their original habitats on the southern periphery of Gurbantonggut Desert, Central Asia, during the growing season in 2005. Changes in photosynthesis, transpiration, leaf water potential, water-use efficiency, above-ground biomass accumulation and root distribution of the two species were examined and compared under the contrasting precipitation treatments. There were significant interspecific differences in water-use strategy and maintenance of photosynthesis under variation in precipitation. For the phreatophyte T. ramosissima, physiological activity and biomass accumulation rely on the stable groundwater, which shields it from fluctuation in the water status of the upper soil layers caused by precipitation. For the non-phreatophyte H. ammodendron, efficient morphological adjustment, combined with strong stomatal control, contributes to its acclimation to variation in precipitation. On account of its positive responses to increased precipitation, H. ammodendron is predicted to succeed in interspecific competition in a future, moister habitat. © 2007 The Authors.","Biomass accumulation; Haloxylon; Photosynthesis; Root distribution; Tamarix; Variation in precipitation; Water-use strategy","rain; water; aboveground biomass; adaptation; comparative study; ecomorphology; ecophysiology; groundwater; growing season; interspecific competition; interspecific variation; photosynthesis; precipitation (climatology); root system; seasonal variation; shrub; transpiration; water use efficiency; acclimatization; Amaranthaceae; article; Asia; biomass; comparative study; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; histology; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant root; season; species difference; sweating; Tamaricaceae; Acclimatization; Amaranthaceae; Asia, Central; Biomass; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Transpiration; Rain; Seasons; Species Specificity; Tamaricaceae; Water; Asia; Central Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Gurbantonggut Desert; Xinjiang Uygur; Haloxylon; Haloxylon ammodendron; Tamarix; Tamarix ramosissima",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Anderson, J.E., Factors controlling transpiration and photosynthesis in Tamarix chinensis Lour (1982) Ecology, 63, pp. 48-56; Brown, J.H., Valone, T.J., Curtin, C.G., Reorganization of an arid ecosystem in response to recent climate change (1997) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 94, pp. 9729-9733; Buckley, T.N., The control of stomata by water balance (2005) New Phytologist, 168, pp. 275-292; Cohen, Y., Fuchs, M., Cohen, S., Resistance to water uptake in a mature citrus tree (1983) Journal of Experimental Botany, 34, pp. 451-560; Donovan, L.A., Ehleringer, J.R., Water stress and use of summer precipitation in a Great Basin shrub community (1994) Functional Ecology, 8, pp. 289-297; Eagleson, P.S., Ecological optimality in water limited natural soil-vegetation systems (1982) Water Resources Research, 18, pp. 325-354; Ehleringer, J.R., Variation in gas exchange characteristics among desert plants (1995) Ecophysiology of Photosynthesis, pp. 361-392. , eds E.D.
