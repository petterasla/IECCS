A renewable fuel contributes to a lesser global climate change. Vegetable oil derivatives, namely, biodiesel, is being used in smaller volumes in some of the present day diesel engines. High smoke emission and lower thermal efficiency are the main problems associated with the use of neat vegetable oils in diesel engines. In the present paper we report on the utilization of rubber seed oil (RSO) as a primary fuel with eiethyl ether (DEE) as a combustion enhancer in a diesel engine. DEE was recently reported as a renewable fuel and a low-emission high-quality combustion improver. A single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled direct injection diesel engine having a rated output of 4.4 kW was used for the experiments. DEE was injected into the intake port during the suction stroke, while RSO was injected directly inside the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke [23° BTDC (before top dead center)]. Parameters such as the injection timing, duration, and quantity of DEE were optimized at different loads. The brake thermal efficiency improves from 26.5% with neat RSO to a maximum of 28.5% with DEE injected at a rate of 200 g/h. The results also indicate a reduction in emissions except the NO x level at all loads. Smoke is reduced significantly from 6.1 to 4 BSU (Bosch smoke units) with DEE injection. The combustion duration decreases with DEE injection, which will contribute to a higher heat release rate in the initial stages of combustion. On the whole it is concluded that DEE can be injected into the inlet port to reduce emissions and improve the thermal efficiency of vegetableoil- fueled diesel. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Brake thermal efficiencies; Combustion durations; Compression strokes; Diethyl ethers; Direct injection diesel engines; Experimental investigations; Global climate changes; Heat release rates; High qualities; Initial stages; Injection timings; Inlet ports; Intake ports; Primary fuels; Renewable fuels; Rubber seed oil; Smoke emissions; Sustainable energies; Thermal efficiencies; Top dead centers; Vegetable oil; Climate change; Cylinders (shapes); Energy conservation; Engine cylinders; Engines; Ethers; Ignition; Leakage (fluid); Lubricating oils; Organic compounds; Renewable energy resources; Rubber; Smoke; Thermal effects; Thermochemistry; Vegetable oils; Diesel engines",,,,,,"Ziejewski, M., Goettier, H., (1986) Influence of vegetable oil based alternate fuels on residue deposits and components wear in a diesel engine, , Society of Automotive Engineers, Paper No. 860302; Vellguth, G., (1983) Performance of vegetable oils and their monoesters as fuel for diesel engines, , Society of Automotive Engineers, Paper No. 831358; Stoner, M., Litzinger, T., (1999) Effects of structure and boiling point of oxygenates blending compounds in reducing diesel emissions, , Society of Automotive Engineers, Paper No. 1999-01-1475; Litzinger, T., Stoner, M., Effects of oxygenated blending compounds on emissions from a turbo-charged direct injection diesel engine (2000) Int.
