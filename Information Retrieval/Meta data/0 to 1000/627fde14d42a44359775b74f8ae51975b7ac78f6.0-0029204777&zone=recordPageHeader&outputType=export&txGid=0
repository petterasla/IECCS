Therefore, recent trends in the climate change, most likely caused by increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other radiative trace gases in the atmosphere, and the expected consequent global warming, are now a major concern. In this paper, an optimal strategy for reducing carbon emissions for the next couple of decades, when large uncertainties surround global warming is evaluated ways of establishing 'no-regret' policy are shown.",,"Climate change; Costs; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Global warming; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cost distribution; Energy taxes; Global strategy; Gross national product; Particulate emissions",,,,,,,"Sinyak, Yuri; Int Inst for Applied Systems, Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria",,,"Inderscience Enterprises Ltd, Geneva Aeroport, Switzerland",,,,,09574352,,IJVLE,,"English","Int J Environ Pollut",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029204777
