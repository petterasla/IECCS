The latter is a small convective region embedded in the northwest corner of the Norwegian Sea. The model for each region consists of a thermodynamic ice layer that covers two layers of saline water which can, under specific conditions, become statically unstable and hence create a state of active overturning. The system is forced by monthly mean atmospheric temperatures in the four regions, by continental runoffs and by inflows from adjacent oceans. The model predicts the ice thickness, and the temperature and salinity of the water in the upper layer of the four regions. Also determined are the water temperature and salinity of the lower layer in the Arctic Ocean box. The convective state of any given region, i.e. whether it is in an active overturning mode or not, is also determined as a continuous function of time. The different output variables of the model, which are the response to climatological forcing conditions, compare favourably with observed data. In the control run, the Arctic Ocean region is characterized by continuous ice cover, the Greenland Sea and Greenland Gyre have ice cover only during winter, and the Norwegian Sea region never forms an ice cover. Another feature of the control run is the winter time occurrence of convective overturning in the upper 200 m in the Greenland Gyre region. The model is also used for different anomaly experiments: a positive air temperature anomaly which represents a global warming of the earth, a negative salt anomaly in the Norwegian Sea which simulates the great salinity anomaly of the 1960s and 1970s, and an increase in the ice flux through Fram Strait which parameterizes anomalous ice production in the Arctic. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",,"box model; circulation modelling; ocean modelling; thermohaline circulation; upper ocean; Arctic Ocean; Greenland Sea; Norwegian Sea",,,,,,"Aagaard, K., Carmark, E.C., The role of sea ice and other fresh water in the Arctic circulation (1989) Journal of Geophysical Research, 94, pp. 14485-14498; Björk, G., A one-dimensional time-dependent model for the vertical stratification of the upper Arctic Ocean (1989) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 19, pp. 52-67; Bourke, R.H., Garrett, R.P., Sea ice thickness distribution in the Arctic Ocean (1987) Cold Regions Sci Techn, 13, pp. 259-280; Bourke, R.H., McLaren, A.S., Contour mapping of Arctic basin ice draft and roughness parameters (1992) Journal of Geophysical Research, 97, pp. 17715-17728; Carmack, E., Aagaard, K., On the deep water of the Greenland Sea (1973) Deep-Sea Res, 20, pp. 687-715; Carmack, E.C., Large-scale physical oceanography of polar oceans (1990) Polar oceanography, Part A: physical science, pp. 171-222. , Academic Press, San Diego; Clarke, R.A., Swift, J.H., Reid, J.L., Koltermann, K.P., The formation of Greenland Sea deep water: double diffusion or deep convection?
