It includes a brief review of current development policies, technological research and promotion efforts, and climate change that demonstrates that mutual policy initiatives undertaken by governments and the private sector actually have major positive impacts on climate change without being initiated by this global policy concern. Furthermore a number of examples are given on how future development objectives in Brazil, China, and India jointly can support economic and social goals and global climate change concerns if these goals are taken into consideration and supported by international cooperative mechanisms. The paper proposes international cooperative mechanisms that can support the implementation of integrated development and climate change policies. The mechanisms include an international sustainable development (SD) and Climate Finance Mechanism (SDCFM), technology development and transition programmes, technology standards, and other measures. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Carbon trading; Developing countries; International climate change cooperation; Sustainable development; Technological change and penetration","climate change; developing world; environmental policy; implementation process; research work; stakeholder; sustainable development; Asia; Brazil; China; Eurasia; Far East; India; South America; South Asia",,,,,,"(2003) Poverty and Climate Change: Reducing the Vulnerability of the Poor Through Adaptation, , http://www.undp.org/energy/climate.htm#pcc, ADB, UNEP, World Bank, AfDB, GTZ, DFID, OECD, EC Available online at; Asquith, N.M., Vargas Ríos, M.T., Smith, J., Can Forest-Protection Carbon Projects Improve Rural Livelihoods?
