Additionally, the compromised-host hypothesis suggests that rising ocean temperatures may increase disease activity by making the corals more susceptible to ubiquitous pathogens. We tested the effects of reducing irradiance stress on coral-disease progression rates by shading corals showing signs consistent with white-plague disease. Our results showed that white-plague disease on shaded corals progressed significantly more slowly than on controls. Although the mechanisms are unknown, this study suggests that light intensity influences the rate of coral-disease progression. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Coral disease; Coral-disease progression; Coral-host stress; Light; Reactive oxygen species","Anthozoa",,,,,,"Ben-Haim, Y., Rosenberg, E., A novel Vibrio sp. pathogen of the coral Pocillopora damicornis (2002) Mar Biol, 114, pp. 47-55; Bruno, J.F., Selig, E.R., Casey, K.S., Page, C.A., Willis, B.L., Harvell, C.D., Sweatman, H., Melendy, A.M., Thermal stress and coral cover as drivers of coral disease outbreaks (2007) PLoS Biol, 5 (6), pp. e124. , doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050124; Dustan, P., Vitality of coral populations off Key Largo, Florida: Recruitment and mortality (1977) Environ Geol, 2, pp. 51-58; Fine, M., Banin, E., Israely, T., Rosenberg, E., Loya, Y., Ultraviolet radiation prevents bleaching in the Mediterranean coral Oculina patagonica (2002) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 226, pp. 249-254; Harvell, C.D., Kiho, K., Quirolo, C., Weir, J., Smith, G., (2001) Coral Bleaching and Disease: Contributors to 1998 Mass Mortality in Briareum Asbestinum, , Gorgonacea: Octocorallia; Harvell, C.D., Mitchell, C.E., Ward, J.R., Altizer, S., Dobson, A.P., Ostfeld, R.S., Samuel, M.D., Climate warming and disease risks for terrestrial and marine biota (2002) Science, 296, pp. 2158-2162; Hutton, D., Smith, V., Antibacterial properties of isolated amoebocytes from the sea anemone Actinia equine (1996) Biol Bull, 191, pp. 441-451; Jones, R.J., Bowyer, J., Hough-Guldberg, O., Blackall, L.L., Dynamics of a temperature-related coral disease outbreak (2004) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 281, pp. 63-77; Kaczmarsky, L.T., Draud, M., Williams, E.H., Is there a relationship between proximity to sewage effluent and the prevalence of coral disease?
