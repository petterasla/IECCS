Despite this recognized role for marine aerosol, however, recent research has emphasized the impact of global climate change on coastal environments rather than the other way around. This occurs in part because most methods for sampling marine aerosol are expensive and studies tend to occur only on specialized marine stations and ocean-crossing research vessels. This project tests a new method for aerosol sampling, specifically designed for use in local studies of coastal environments and costing little to set up. It also reports the results of a pilot study in Alderney (Channel Islands) where changes in both aerosol abundance and aerosol composition, including fractionation effects, were observed using the new method and linked to local meteorological conditions. © 2010 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Aerosol production; Coastal aerosol; Fractionation; Local meteorology","aerosol composition; aerosol formation; air sampling; climate change; filter; global climate; marine atmosphere; meteorology; Alderney; Channel Islands [United Kingdom]; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Andreae, M.O., Crutzen, P.J., Atmospheric aerosols: biogeochemical sources and role in atmospheric chemistry (1997) Science, 276, pp. 1052-1058; Anguelova, M., Barber, R.P., Wu, J., Spume drops produced by wind tearing of wave crests (1999) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 29, pp. 1156-1165; Apsimon, H., Amann, M., Åström, S., Oxley, T., Synergies in addressing air quality and climate change (2009) Climate Policy, 9, pp. 669-680; Bates, T.S., Quinn, P.K., Covert, D.S., Coffman, D.J., Johnson, J.E., Wiedensohler, A., Aerosol physical properties and processes in the lower marine boundary layer: a comparison of shipboard sub-micron data from ACE-1 and ACE-2 (2000) Tellus B, 52, pp. 258-272; Belloiun, N., Boucher, O., Haywood, J., Reddy, M.S., Global estimate of aerosol direct radiative forcing from satellite measurements (2005) Nature, 438, pp. 1138-1141; Bigg, G.R., (2003) The Oceans and Climate, , 2nd edn., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Blanchard, D.C., The ejection of drops from the sea and their enrichment with bacteria and other materials: a review (1989) Estuaries, 12, pp. 127-137; Blanchard, D.C., Syzdek, L.D., Seven problems in bubble and jet drop researches (1978) Limnology and Oceanography, 23, pp. 389-400; Blanchard, D.C., Woodcock, A.H., The production, concentration and vertical distribution of the sea-salt aerosol (1980) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 80, pp. 330-347; Busek, P.R., Posfai, M., Airborne minerals and related aerosol particles: effects on climate and the environment (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 96, pp. 3372-3379; Cavalli, F., Facchini, M.C., Decesari, S., Mircea, M., Emblico, L., Fuzzi, S., Ceburnis, D., Dell'Aqua, A., Advances in characterisation of size-resolved organic matter in marine aerosol over the North Atlantic (2004) Journal of Geophysical Research, 109, pp. D24215; Gasso, S., Hegg, D.A., Covert, D.S., Collins, D., Noone, K.J., Öström, E., Schmid, B., Jonsson, H., Influence of humidity on the aerosol scattering coefficient and its effect on the upwelling radiance during ACE-2 (2000) Tellus B, 52, pp. 546-567; Gong, S.L., Barrie, L.A., Lazare, M., Canadian Aerosol Module (CAM): a size-segregated simulation of atmospheric aerosol processes for climate and air quality models 2.
