The 600kW of about 2MW system was completed and it has been operated since April, 2008. The 600kW system is composed of many kinds of PV modules. In this paper, we report on the output performance of the 600kW-PV system, of various PV modules, and of single-axis tracking system. © 2010 IEEE.","Performance ratio; PV module; PV system; Tracking system","Output performance; Performance ratio; Photovoltaic systems; PV modules; PV system; Single-axis; Solar project; Tracking system; Navigation; Solar power generation; Telecommunication; Photovoltaic effects",,,,,,"Konishi, H., Tanaka, R., Shiraki, T., Operation and monitoring system of hokuto mega-solar project (2008) Proc.
