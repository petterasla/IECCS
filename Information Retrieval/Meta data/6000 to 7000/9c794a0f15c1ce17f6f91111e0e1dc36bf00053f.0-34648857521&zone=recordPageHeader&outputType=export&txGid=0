It is easy to take account the stabilization of global warming gases concentration in the atmosphere, as those methods can conduct the time variations analysis. The methods are named Total Warming Prediction Analysis (TWPA) and Composite Warming Potential (CWP). The evaluation of Mobile Air Conditioning refrigerant is presented as an example of application of our method. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
