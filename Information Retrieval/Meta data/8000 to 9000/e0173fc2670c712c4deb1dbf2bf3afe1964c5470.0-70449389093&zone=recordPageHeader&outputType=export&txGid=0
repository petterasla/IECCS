Larval and adult grass shrimp were exposed to the fungicide chlorothalonil and the insecticide Scourge® under standard toxicity test conditions, a 10°C increase in temperature, a 10 ppt increase in salinity, and a combined increased temperature and salinity exposure. Toxicity of the fungicide chlorothalonil increased with temperature and salinity. Toxicity of the insecticide Scourge® also increased with temperature; while increased salinity reduced Scourge® toxicity, but only in adult shrimp. These findings suggest that changes in temperature and salinity may alter the toxicity of certain pesticides, and that the nature of the effect will depend on both the organism's life stage and the chemical contaminant. Standard toxicity bioassays may not be predictive of actual pesticide toxicity under variable environmental conditions, and testing under a wider range of exposure conditions could improve the accuracy of chemical risk assessments. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate change; Estuaries; Pesticides; Shrimp; Toxicity","Chemical contaminants; Chemical risk assessment; Chlorothalonil; Environmental conditions; Exposure conditions; Global climate changes; Grass shrimp; Increased temperature; Life stages; Palaemonetes pugio; Potential impacts; Salinity effects; Shrimp; Toxicity test; Agricultural chemicals; Estuaries; Fungicides; Insecticides; Risk assessment; Risk management; Salinity measurement; Toxicity; Climate change; chlorothalonil; fungicide; insecticide; nitrile; pyrethroid; resmethrin; bioassay; crustacean; ecotoxicology; environmental conditions; estuarine ecosystem; fungicide; global change; pollution exposure; risk assessment; salinity; temperature effect; toxicity test; animal; article; bioassay; climate change; dose response; drug effect; growth, development and aging; larva; osmolarity; Palaemonidae; salinity; temperature; water pollutant; Animals; Biological Assay; Climate Change; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fungicides, Industrial; Insecticides; Larva; Nitriles; Osmolar Concentration; Palaemonidae; Pyrethrins; Salinity; Temperature; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Decapoda (Crustacea); Palaemonetes pugio",,"chlorothalonil, 1897-45-6; resmethrin, 10453-86-8; Fungicides, Industrial; Insecticides; Nitriles; Pyrethrins; Water Pollutants, Chemical; resmethrin, 10453-86-8; tetrachloroisophthalonitrile, 1897-45-6",,,,"Kennish, M.J., Environmental threats and environmental future of estuaries (2002) Environ.
