The State's mean annual rainfall is found to be in decreasing trend along with its sixteen years cyclic periodicity. The State first half century's (1901-1950) normal of 1204 mm has been reduced to 1140 mm during second half of the century (1951-2000). Nevertheless, few districts like Bengaluru, Kolar and Tumkur are gaining in their mean annual rainfall and some traditionally heavy rainfall receiving districts like Kodagu, Chikmagalur and South Canara are loosing in their mean annual rainfall. The eastern districts of the state are tending to be more dependent on North East monsoon than terminal rains of the South West monsoon. Consequently individual crop growing area, growing period are changing. The normal sowing season rains are being delayed due to the shift of July rains to the August month and September peak rainfall is being shifted to October month. The maximum water available period for the grand growth period is shifting towards the end of September and beginning of October in many districts. Finger millet crop area (main food crop of southern Karnataka) in Chikmagalur district, Groundnut area in Chitradurga and Tumkur districts, Red gram in Bidar and Gulbarga districts is increasing. Where as, Groundnut area in Belgaum and Gulbarga districts and Red gram area in Belgam and Tumkur is decreasing.","Climate change; Global warming; Productivity; Rainfall","Arachis hypogaea; Eleusine coracana",,,,,,"Report, A., Drought-2002 in Karnataka State (2003) Impact and Response, p. 1. , Drought Monitoring Cell, Govt. of Karnataka, Bangalore; Guruprasanna, H.L., Panduranga Ravindrababu, B.T., Rajegowda, M.B., Rainfall and runoff pattern of Coorg district of Karnataka State (2006) J.
