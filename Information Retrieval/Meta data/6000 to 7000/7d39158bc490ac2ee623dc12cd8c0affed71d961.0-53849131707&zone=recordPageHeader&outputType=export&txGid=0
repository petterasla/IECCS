It is evidenced that after the global warming, a new phenomenon that occurs in the terrestrial atmosphere has drawn the attention of the scientific community. It is called global dimming - the decrease of the solar beams capacity (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) to reach the earth surface, with the effect of cooling the surface, masking the effects of global warming over the general climate.","Climatic changes; Cooling earth surface; Global dimming; Global warming; Solar beams",,,,,,,"Antohi, C., Monitoring of environmental factors air-water (2002) Performantica, , in Romanian, Press, Iasi, Romania; Bhaskharan, B., Mitchell, J.F.B., Simulated changes in the intensity and variability of the southeast Asian monsoon in the twenty first century resulting from anthropogenic emissions scenarios (1998) Int.
