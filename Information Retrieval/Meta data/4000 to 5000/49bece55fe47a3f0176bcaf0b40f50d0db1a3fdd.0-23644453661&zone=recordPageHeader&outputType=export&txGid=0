Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming. My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and-taking into account an increasing coastal population-a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.",,"Correlation methods; Energy dissipation; Frequencies; Global warming; Hurricane effects; Oceanography; Thermal effects; Climate signals; Hurricane activity; Sea surface temperature; Tropical cyclones; Storms; global warming; hurricane; tropical cyclone; article; Atlantic islands; climate; destruction; disaster; greenhouse effect; hurricane; oscillation; Pacific islands; priority journal; temperature",,,,,,"Emanuel, K.A., The dependence of hurricane intensity on climate (1987) Nature, 326, pp. 483-485; Knutson, T.R., Tuleya, R.E., Impact of CO2-induced warming on simulated hurricane intensity and precipitation: Sensitivity to the choice of climate model and convective parameterization (2004) J.
