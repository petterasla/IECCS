The peak values of the three temperature-decreasing periods with the 2 930 a cycle occur at about 7 300, 4 250 and 1 200 Cal. aBP. There are 7 - 8 temperature-decreasing periods with the 1 140 a cycle, and the climate fluctuation range is largest in the early Holocene, and reduces gradually in the middle and late Holocene. The millennial-scale climatic change in the Holocene may adjust the global water cycle and the thermohaline circulation intensity through the harmonic tones of the earth's precession cycle, which in turn influences the global climate change.","Climatic periodicity; Holocene; Maar Lake","article; China; climate; geography; global climate; meteorology; paleoanthropology; periodicity",,,,,,"Denton, G.H., Karlen, W., Holocene climatic variations: Their pattern and cause (1973) Quaternary Research, 3, p. 155; Bond, G., Showers, W., Cheseby, M., A pervasive millennial-scale cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and glacial climates (1997) Science, 278, p. 1257; Grafenstein, U., Erlenkeuser, H., Muller, J., The cold event 8 200 years ago documented in oxygen isotope records of precipitation in Europe and Greenland (1998) Climate Dynamics, 14, p. 73; Wang, L., Sarmthein, M., Erlenkeuser, H., East Asian monsoon climate during the late Pleistocene: High-resolution sediment records from the South China Sea (1999) Marine Geology, 156, p. 245; Rodbell, D.T., Seltaer, G.O., Anderson, D.M., A-15 000-year record of El Niño-driven alluviation in Southwestern Ecuador (1999) Science, 283, p. 516; Bianchi, G.G., Mccave, I.N., Holocene periodicity in North Atlantic climate and deep-ocean flow south of Iceland (1999) Nature, 397, p. 515; Gou, Z., Petit-Maire, N., Lui, D., Holocene abrupt environmental changes in the arid regions in Africa and Asia (1999) Paleogeography, 1 (1), p. 68; McIntyre, A., Molfino, B., Forcing of Atlantic equatorial and subpolar millennial cycles by precession (1996) Science, 274, p. 1867; Mikolajewicz, U., Crowley, T.J., Schiller, A., Modeling teleconnections between the North Atlantic and North Pacific during the Younger Dryas (1997) Nature, 387, p. 384; Broecker, W.S., What drives glacial cycles?
