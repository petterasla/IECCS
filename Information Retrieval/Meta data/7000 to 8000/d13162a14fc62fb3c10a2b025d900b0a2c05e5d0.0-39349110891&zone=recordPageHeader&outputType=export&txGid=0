Parameters are the increase in CO2 forcing (with stabilization after a specified time interval) and the model's climate sensitivity. In this model, the cessation of deep sinking in the north ""Atlantic"" (hereinafter, a ""collapse""), as indicated by changes in the MOC, behaves like a simple bifurcation. The final surface air temperature (SAT) change, which is closely predicted by the product of the radiative forcing and the climate sensitivity, determines whether a collapse occurs. The initial transient response in SAT is largely a function of the forcing increase, with higher sensitivity runs exhibiting delayed behavior; accordingly, high CO2-low sensitivity scenarios can be assessed as a recovering or collapsing circulation shortly after stabilization, whereas low CO2-high sensitivity scenarios require several hundred additional years to make such a determination. We also systemically examine how the rate of forcing, for a given CO2 stabilization, affects the ocean response. In contrast with previous studies based on results using simpler ocean models, we find that except for a narrow range of marginally stable to marginally unstable scenarios, the forcing rate has little impact on whether the run collapses or recovers. In this narrow range, however, forcing increases on a time scale of slow ocean advective processes results in weaker declines in overturning strength and can permit a run to recover that would otherwise collapse. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"bifurcation; carbon dioxide; climate forcing; greenhouse effect; meridional circulation; overturn; sensitivity analysis; three-dimensional modeling; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",,,,,,"Andronova, N.G., Schlesinger, M.E., Objective estimation of the probability density function for climate sensitivity (2001) J Geophys Res, 106, pp. 22605-22612; Bitz, C.M., Lipscombe, W.H., An energy-conserving thermodynamic model of sea ice (1999) J Geophys Res, 104, pp. 15669-15677; Clark, P.U., Pisias, N., Stocker, T.F., Weaver, A.J., The role of the thermohaline circulation in abrupt climate change (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 863-869; Colman, R., A comparison of climate feedbacks in general circulation models (2003) Clim Dyn, 20, pp. 865-873; Cubasch, Projections of future climate change (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientfic Basis: Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 525-582. , In: Houghton JT et al (eds) Cambridge Univ Press, New York; Dalan, F., Stone, P.H., Kamenkovich, I.V., Scott, J.R., Sensitivity of the ocean's climate to diapycnal diffusivity in an EMIC.
