The aim of this paper is to establish what would be the likely decrease in the productivity of urban workers due to an increase in tropical cyclone-related downtime. The methodology used simulates future tropical cyclones by magnifying the intensity of historical tropical cyclones between the years 1978 and 2008. It then uses a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the expected number of hours that a certain area can expect to be affected by winds of a given strength. It shows how annual downtime from tropical cyclones could increase from 1.5% nowadays to up to 2.2% by 2085, an increase of almost 50%. This decrease in productivity could result in a loss of up to 0.7% of the annual Taiwanese GDP by 2085. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science, United Nations University, and Springer 2009.","Climate change; Intensity increase; Productivity; Tropical cyclone; Typhoon; Urban areas",,,,,,,"Buhaug, H., Rød, J.K., Local determinants of African civil wars, 1970-2001 (2006) Political Geogr, 25 (3), pp. 315-335; Chan, J.C.L., Comment on ""changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity in a warming environment"" (2006) Science, 311, p. 1713; Chang, K.T., Chiu, C.M., Regression analysis of typhoon surge in Taiwan (2007) 2007 International Conference on Disaster Prevention and Emergency Response, , http://ehs.yuntech.edu.tw/doc/96//Kuo-Tung%20Chang.pdf, In: Accessed 8 Aug 2009 (in Chinese); Emanuel, K., A statistical analysis of tropical cyclone intensity (2000) Mon Weather Rev, 128, pp. 1139-1152; Emanuel, K., Sundararajan, R., Williams, J., Hurricanes and global warming.
