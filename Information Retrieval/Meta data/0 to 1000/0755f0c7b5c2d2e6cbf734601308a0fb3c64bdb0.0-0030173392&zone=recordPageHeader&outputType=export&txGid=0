This concept provides two important benefits: (i) captured CO2 can be utilized as a flooding agent which would generate revenue from incremental oil production, and (ii) CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are reduced, helping to alleviate global warming. In the past few years, a number of feasibility studies and pilot projects on CO2 extraction from power plants have been performed. However, these results have shown that even though it is technically feasible to extract CO2 from power plants, the EOR application cost is high in the current crude petroleum market. A major reason for the high cost is that the CO2 extracting process requires a substantial amount of steam. This paper will demonstrate how cogeneration concepts would help to reduce CO2 production costs by utilizing low-pressure steams and waste heats from various sections of the power generation processes. The economics are based on the installation of a power generation plant and CO2 recovery facility in an existing oil producing facility.",,"Absorption; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Enhanced recovery; Natural gas; Rankine cycle; Steam; Waste heat utilization; Carbon dioxide production; Carbon dioxide recovery facility; Cost reduction; Low pressure steam; Monoethanolamine; Shut-in gas; Cogeneration plants",,,,,,"Reinsch, A.E., Battle, E.F., (1987) Industrial Cogeneration in Canada: Prospects and Perspectives, pp. 24-26. , Canadian Energy Research Institute, Calgary, Alberta, March; Miller, D.B., Soychak, T.J., Gosar, D.M., Economics of Recovering CO2 from Exhaust Gases (1986) Chemical Engineering Progress, 82 (10), pp. 38-46. , October; 1992 - 1993 Electric Power and Budget Pricing for Basic Gas Turbine Packages (1992) 1992 - 93 Gas Turbine World Handbook, pp. 1-20; Limaye, D.R., (1987) Industrial Cogeneration Applications, p. 118. , 1st ed., Fairmont Press, Lilburn, Georgia; Astarita, G., Savage, D.W., Bisio, A., (1983) Gas Treating with Chemical Solvents; 1st Ed., , John Wiley and Sons, New York, New York; (1990) Our Future Generation, p. 23. , Saskatchewan Power Corporation, Regina, Saskatchewan; Peters, M.S., Timmerhaus, K.D., (1991) Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers; 4th Ed., , McGraw-Hill, New York, New York; Tontiwachwuthikul, P., Gelowitz, D., Kritpiphat, W., Cogeneration Concepts for Recovering CO2 from Fossil-fuel Fired Power Plants (1993) 5th Saskatchewan Petroleum Conference of the South Saskatchewan Section, the Petroleum Society and CANMET, , paper presented Regina, Saskatchewan, October 18 - 20; (1993) Cogeneration Systems, p. 8. , Solar Turbines Incorporated, San Diego, California; Snyder, W.G., Depew, C.A., (1986) Co-production of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Electricity, , Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California","University of Regina",,,,,,,,00219487,,JCPMA,,"English","J Can Pet Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030173392
