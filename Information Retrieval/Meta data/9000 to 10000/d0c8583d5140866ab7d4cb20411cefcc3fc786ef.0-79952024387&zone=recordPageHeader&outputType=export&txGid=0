The power output of different configurations of MFCs using distilled water (DW), domestic wastewater (DWW) and fermented domestic wastewater (FDWW) was determined. The power output of FDWW was found to be greater than that of DWW and DW which showed that the fermentation of the organic matter present in a wastewater is the major cause of the generation of electrical energy. The highest power output (0.82 mW) was observed by the parallel combination of two units of double chamber open system MFC (DCOS-MFC). The mam objective and scope of this research article is to investigate the environmental friendly alternatives of the production of energy which can overcome the global energy crisis, global pollution and global warming which are currently caused by the extensive use of fossil fuels.",,,,,,,,"Lovely, D.R., (2006) Nature, 4, p. 497; Katz, E., Shipway, A.N., Willner, I., Biochemical fuel cells (2003) Handbook of Fuel Cells Fundamentals, Technology and Applications, 1, p. 355. , Vielstich, In W.
