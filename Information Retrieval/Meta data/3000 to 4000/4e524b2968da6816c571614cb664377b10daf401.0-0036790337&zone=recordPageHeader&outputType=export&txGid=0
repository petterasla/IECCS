The objective of this project was to examine interactions between landscape environmental factors and interannual variability of land-cover types in this region. Harmonic analysis of a nine-year time series (1989-1997) of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) biweekly composite data was used to quantify interannual changes in natural and managed vegetation. An index of interannual landscape variability was developed based on the weighted circular variance in phase values produced by the harmonic analysis. Results indicate that landscape variability, as quantified by the weighted circular variance, is significantly different among three soil texture classes and five land-use/land-cover types. Harmonic analysis of time-series data offers considerable promise as a tool for monitoring landscape change.",,"Climate change; Harmonic analysis; Vegetation; Landscape variability; Remote sensing; climate change; environmental factor; landscape change; remote sensing; vegetation cover; North America",,,,,,"Andres, L., Salas, W.A., Skole, D., Fourier analysis of multi-temporal AVHRR data applied to a land cover classification (1994) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 15 (5), pp. 1115-1121; Azzali, S., Menenti, M., Mapping vegetation-soil-climate complexes in southern Africa using temporal Fourier analysis using NOAA-AVHRR-NDVI data (2000) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 21 (5), pp. 973-996; Briggs, J., Nellie, M.D., Seasonal variation of heterogeneity in the tallgrass prairie: A quantitative measure using remote sensing (1991) Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, 57, pp. 407-411; Davis, J.C., (1986) Statistics and Data Analysis in Geology, Second Edition, , J.
