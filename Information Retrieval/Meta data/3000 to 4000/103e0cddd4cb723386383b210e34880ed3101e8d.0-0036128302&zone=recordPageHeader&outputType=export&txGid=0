Beyond these generally accepted facts, the Gaia hypothesis advances three central propositions: (1) that biologically mediated feedbacks contribute to environmental homeostasis, (2) that they make the environment more suitable for life, and (3) that such feedbacks should arise by Darwinian natural selection. These three propositions do not fare well under close scrutiny. (1) Biologically mediated feedbacks are not intrinsically homeostatic. Many of the biological mechanisms that affect global climate are destabilizing, and it is likely that the net effect of biological feedbacks will be to amplify, not dampen, global warming. (2) Nor do biologically mediated feedbacks necessarily enhance the environment, although it will often appear as if this were the case, simply because natural selection will favor organisms that do well in their environments - which means doing well under the conditions that they and their co-occurring species have created. (3) Finally, Gaian feedbacks can evolve by natural selection, but so can anti-Gaian feedbacks. Daisyworld models evolve Gaian feedback because they assume that any trait that improves the environment will also give a reproductive advantage to its carriers (over other organisms that share the same environment). In the real world, by contrast, natural selection favors any trait that gives its carriers a reproductive advantage over its non-carriers, whether it improves or degrades the environment (and thereby benefits or hinders its carriers and non-carriers alike). Thus Gaian and anti-Gaian feedbacks are both likely to evolve.",,"Biodiversity; Degradation; Feedback; Global warming; Natural selections; Climate change; biota; environmental conditions; Gaia theory; hypothesis testing; theoretical study; cellular organisms; Darwinia",,,,,,"Chadson, R.J., Lovelock, J.E., Andreae, M.O., Warren, S.G., Oceanic phytoplankton, atmospheric sulphur, cloud albedo and climate (1987) Nature, 326, pp. 655-661; Ciais, P., Tans, P.P., Trolier, M., White, J.W.C., Francey, R.J., A large northern hemisphere terrestrial CO2 sink indicated by the 13C/12C ratio of atmospheric CO2 (1995) Science, 269, pp. 1098-1102; Falkowski, P., Scholes, R.J., Boyle, E., Canadell, J., Canfield, D., Elser, J., Gruber, N., Steffen, W., The global carbon cycle: A test of our knowledge of Earth as a system (2000) Science, 290, pp. 291-296; Gillon, J., Feedback on Gaia (2000) Nature, 406, pp. 685-686; Hamilton, W.D., Ecology in the large: Gaia and Ghengis Khan (1995) J.
