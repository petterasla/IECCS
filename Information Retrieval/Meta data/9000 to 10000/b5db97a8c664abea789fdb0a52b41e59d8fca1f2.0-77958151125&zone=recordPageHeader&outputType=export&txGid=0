Box 2703, Beijing 100190, China","China's total installed electrical power capacity reached 700. GW by the end of 2007 and is predicted to surpass 900. GW in 2010. The rapid increase in energy demand and increasing global warming have both pushed China to change its current electrical power structure where coal power accounts for nearly 75% of the total electric power generation. China has already become the world's largest solar water heater producer and user. However, there is still much to be done in the solar thermal power field before its commercialization. Solar thermal power technologies including solar power towers, solar parabolic trough concentrators, solar dish/stirling systems, linear Fresnel reflectors, and solar chimneys have been studied in China since the 1980s. A 10. kW dish/stirling project was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) during 2000-2005 with a 1. MW solar power tower and research of trough concentrator metal-glass evacuated tubes supported during 2006-2010. This paper describes a continued solar thermal power development roadmap in China in 5-year intervals between 2006 and 2025. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","China roadmap; Concentrated solar power; Cost; Development; Dish/stirling; Line Fresnel Reflector; Parabolic trough; Power tower","Concentrated solar power; Development; Dish/stirling; Fresnel; Parabolic trough; Power tower; Roadmap; Concentration (process); Electric power generation; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy management; Global warming; Reflection; Solar heating; Solar power plants; Technological forecasting; Towers; Water heaters; Solar chimneys; commercialization; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; global warming; research work; solar power; technological development; thermal power; China",,,,,,"China's energy conditions and policies, , http://en.ndrc.gov.cn/policyrelease/default.htm, See also:, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC),People's Republic of China; Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy in China, , http://en.chinagate.com.cn/reports/2007-09/13/content_8872839.htm, See also:, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC),People's Republic of China; Report: China's total installed capacity of electric power in 2007, , http://www.serc.gov.cn/xyxx/dljs/200802/t20080220_4962.htm, See also:, State Electricity Regulatory Commission,People's Republic of China; Wang, Z., Yao, Z., The design of a 1 MW solar thermal tower plant in Beijing, China (2007) Proceedings of ISES Solar World Congress 2007, 4, pp. 1729-1733. , Springer, Beijing, China","Wang, Z.; Key Lab. of Solar Thermal Energy and Photovoltaic System of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Electrical Engineering, P.O.
