While the economic and social values of beaches are generally regarded as paramount, sandy shores also have special ecological features and contain a distinctive biodiversity that is generally not recognized. These unique ecosystems are facing escalating anthropogenic pressures, chiefly from rapacious coastal development, direct human uses - mainly associated with recreation - and rising sea levels. Beaches are increasingly becoming trapped in a 'coastal squeeze' between burgeoning human populations from the land and the effects of global climate change from the sea. Society's interventions (e.g. shoreline armouring, beach nourishment) to combat changes in beach environments, such as erosion and shoreline retreat, can result in severe ecological impacts and loss of biodiversity at local scales, but are predicted also to have cumulative large-scale consequences worldwide. Because of the scale of this problem, the continued existence of beaches as functional ecosystems is likely to depend on direct conservation efforts. Conservation, in turn, will have to increasingly draw on a consolidated body of ecological theory for these ecosystems. Although this body of theory has yet to be fully developed, we identify here a number of critical research directions that are required to progress coastal management and conservation of sandy beach ecosystems. © 2007 The Authors.","Biodiversity; Coastal conservation; Global change; Human impacts; Sandy beaches","anthropogenic effect; climate change; coastal zone management; conservation; ecological impact; ecological theory; global change; global climate; shoreline",,,,,,"Armonies, W., Reise, K., Faunal diversity across a sandy shore (2000) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 196, pp. 49-57; Bascom, W., (1980) Waves and Beaches: The Dynamics of the Ocean Surface., , Anchor Press, Garden City, New York; Beentjes, M.P., Carbines, G.D., Willsman, A.P., Effects of beach erosion on abundance and distribution of toheroa (Paphies ventricosa) at Bluecliffs Beach, Southland, New Zealand, New Zealand (2006) Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 40, pp. 439-453; Bird, E.C.F., (2000) Coastal Geomorphology: An Introduction., , John Wiley, Chichester, UK; Bird, B.L., Branch, L.C., Miller, D.L., Effects of coastal lighting on foraging behavior of beach mice (2004) Conservation Biology, 18, pp. 1435-1439; Brown, A.C., Behavioural plasticity as a key factor in the survival and evolution of the macrofauna on exposed sandy beaches (1996) Revista Chilena de Historia Natural, 69, pp. 469-474; Brown, A.C., McLachlan, A., (1990) Ecology of Sandy Shores., , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Brown, A.C., McLachlan, A., Sandy shore ecosystems and the threats facing them: Some predictions for the year 2025 (2002) Environmental Conservation, 29, pp. 62-77; Burger, J., Foraging behavior and the effect of human disturbance on the piping plover (Charadrius melodus (1991) Journal of Coastal Research, 7, pp. 39-52; Cowell, P.J., Thom, B.G., Jones, R.A., Everts, C.H., Simanovic, D., Management of uncertainty in predicting climate-change impacts on beaches (2006) Journal of Coastal Research, 22, pp. 232-245; Davenport, J., Davenport, J.L., The impact of tourism and personal leisure transport on coastal environments: A review (2006) Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science, 67, pp. 280-292; Defeo, O., De Alava, A., Effects of human activities on long-term trends in sandy beach populations: The wedge clam Donax hanleyanusin Uruguay (1995) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 123, pp. 73-82; Defeo, O., Gómez, J., Morphodynamics and habitat safety in sandy beaches: Life-history adaptations in a supralittoral amphipod (2005) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 293, pp. 143-153; Defeo, O., McLachlan, A., Patterns, processes and regulatory mechanisms in sandy beach macrofauna: A multi-scale analysis (2005) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 295, pp. 1-20; Derraik, J.G.B., The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: A review (2002) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 44, pp. 842-852; Dugan, J.E., Hubbard, D.M., Ecological responses to coastal armouring on exposed sandy beaches (2006) Shore and Beach, 74, pp. 10-16; Dugan, J.E., Hubbard, D.M., McCrary, M.D., Pierson, M.O., The response of macrofauna communities and shorebirds to macrophyte wrack subsidies on exposed sandy beaches of southern California (2003) Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science, 58, pp. 25-40; Fanini, L., Cantarino, C.M., Scapini, F., Relationships between the dynamics of two Talitrus saltatorpopulations and the impacts of activities linked to tourism (2005) Oceanologia, 47, pp. 93-112; Feagin, R.A., Sherman, D.J., Grant, W.E., Coastal erosion, global sea-level rise, and the loss of sand dune plant habitats (2005) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 3, pp. 359-364; Gheskiere, T., Vincx, M., Weslawski, J.M., Scapini, F., Degraer, S., Meiofauna as descriptor of tourism-induced changes at sandy beaches (2005) Marine Environmental Research, 60, pp. 245-265; Godfrey, P.J., Godfrey, M., Ecological effects of off-road vehicles on Cape Cod (1980) Oceanus, 23, pp. 56-67; Harley, C.D.G., Hughes, A.R., Hultgren, K.M., Miner, B.G., Sorte, C.J.B., Thornber, C.S., Rodriguez, L.F., Williams, S.L., The impacts of climate change in coastal marine systems (2006) Ecology Letters, 9, pp. 500-500; Hockings, M., Twyford, K., Assessment and management of beach camping within Fraser Island World Heritage Area, South East Queensland (1997) Australian Journal of Environmental Management, 4, pp. 25-39; De La Huz, R., Lastra, M., Junoy, J., Castellanos, C., Vieitez, J.M., Biological impacts of oil pollution and cleaning in the intertidal zone of exposed sandy beaches: Preliminary study of the 'Prestige' oil spill.
