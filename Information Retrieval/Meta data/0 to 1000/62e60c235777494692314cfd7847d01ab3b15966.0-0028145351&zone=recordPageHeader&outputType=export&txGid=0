An analysis of this debate raises such potentially important questions as: (1) How do historical/developmental differences among nations affect global warming? (2) How does the prior history of one nation affect the subsequent history of another with respect to global warming? And (3), what are the consequences of the separation in time (and space) of the capacity to exacerbate versus mitigate global warming? The larger question underlying all of these is: What is the relationship between differences in national histories, the problem of global warming, and the development of a global system capable of addressing it? © 1994.",,"article; developing country; greenhouse effect; history; human",,,,,,"Agarwal, Narain, (1991) Global Warming in an Unequal World: A Case of Environmental Colonialism, , Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), New Delhi; Ahuja, Estimating National Contributions of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (1992) Global Environmental Change, 2 (2), pp. 83-87; Bateson, (1972) Steps to an Ecology of Mind, , Ballantine Books, New York; Bateson, (1958) Naven, , Stanford University Press, Stanford, California; Bongaarts, Population Growth and Global Warming (1992) Population and Development Review, 18 (2), pp. 299-319; Breckenridge, Protection of Biological and Cultural Diversity: Emerging Recognition of Local Community Rights in Ecosystems under International Environmental Law (1992) Tennessee Law Review, 59 (4), pp. 735-785; Brookfield, ‘Environmental Colonialism’, Tropical Deforestation, and Concerns Other than Global Warming (1992) Global Environmental Change, 2 (2), pp. 93-96; Brosius, The Penan Gang Landscape: Ecology, History and Society in the Borneo Rain Forest (1991) Presented at the Conference on “Interactions of People and Forests in Kalimantan”, held at The New York Botanical Garden, , 21–23 June; Clark, 'Scales of Climatic Impacts (1985) Climatic Change, 7 (1), pp. 5-27; Dixon, Brown, Houghton, Solomon, Trexler, Wisniewski, Carbon Pools and Flux of Global Forest Ecosystems (1994) Science, 263 (5144), pp. 185-190; Dove, A Revisionist View of Tropical Deforestation and Development (1993) Environmental Conservation, 20 (1), pp. 17-24; Dove, A Revisionist View of Tropical Deforestation and Development (1993) Environmental Conservation, 20 (1), p. 56; Dove, Uncertainty, Humility and Adaptation to the Tropical Forest: The Agricultural Augury of the Kantu' (1993) Ethnology, 40 (2), pp. 145-167; Dove, M.R.
