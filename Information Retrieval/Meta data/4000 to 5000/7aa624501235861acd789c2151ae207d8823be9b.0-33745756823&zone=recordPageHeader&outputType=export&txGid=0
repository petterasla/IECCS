The elements were created in the early stage of the Universe and embedded in the solar systems and hence into the planets including our Earth. In the time scale of evolution Man came last of all some 0.0025-0.0030 billion years age under optimum environment of pure air, pure water and pure land as well as forest cover. The history of the progress of human civilisation in terms of science and technology is virtually the history of environmental degradation. Some crucial environmental issues threatening human survival are briefly discussed - Global Warming, Biodiversity, Water Crisis, Human Development. India's Environmental Heritage is also highlighted.","Biodiversity; Environment; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Pollution","element; water; air; article; astronomy; biodiversity; cosmological phenomena; cosmos; environment; environmental impact assessment; evolution; forest; geological time; greenhouse effect; history; human development; India; pollution; survival; water and water related phenomena",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Kashlinsky, A., (2005), cited in Independent, London, NovemberDe, A.K., (2003) ""Environmental Chemistry"", 5th Ed., , New Age International, New Delhi; Allman, W.F., (1989) U.S. News and World Report, , October; (1992) Our Planet, 4 (2). , Nairobi; Khosoo, T.N., (1986) Environmental Priorities in India, , Indian Science Congress Association, New Delhi","De Kumar, A.; Udichi, P 27/1 CIT Scheme VIIM, Kolkata-700 054, India",,,,,,,,00194522,,JICSA,,"English","J.
