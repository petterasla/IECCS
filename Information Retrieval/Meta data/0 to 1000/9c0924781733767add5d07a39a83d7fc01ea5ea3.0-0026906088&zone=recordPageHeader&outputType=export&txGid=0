They come from (1) enhanced fertilization with the single most important plant nutrient, (2) the widely expected global temperature increase, and (3) aggravated weather disturbances. Increased CO2 absorption may enhance plant growth but it may also increase soil-nutrient limitations. It surely will enhance the metabolism of forest trees similarly as global warming will enhance plant metabolism, but both factors may also shorten the lifespan of perennial plants. Increased weather disturbances can be expected to produce new physiological stresses on the standing vegetation, particularly on habitats with poor soils. Since wide-spread forest decline has been reported from both the Atlantic and Pacific region, it seems possible that the roughly synchronie mass mortality of trees during the past two decades is related to the global increase in CO2. The paper gives an overview of forest decline and dieback as known from past and present research and suggests how the changing atmospheric environment may interact in this widely observed contemporary phenomenon of vegetation dynamics. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; climatic change; dieback; forest decline; vegetation dynamics; Carbon Dioxide - Environmental Impact; Greenhouse Effect - Ecology; Meteorology - Weather Modification; Vegetation Dynamics; Ecosystems; carbon dioxide; air pollution; atmosphere; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; forest; nonhuman; plant growth",,,,,,"Acock, B. and Allen L.
