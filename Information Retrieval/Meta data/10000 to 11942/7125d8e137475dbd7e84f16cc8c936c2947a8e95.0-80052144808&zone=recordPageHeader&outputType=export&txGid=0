The reformulation is a twice-differentiable, factorable, nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that can be solved globally using a convexification-based branch-and-reduce algorithm. We compare results to a randomized multistart local-search approach for the original formulation and find that local-search algorithms locate global solutions in 59% of trials for the two-segment case and 18% of trials for the three-segment case. The results indicate that minimum GHG emissions are achieved with a mix of PHEVs sized for 25-45 miles of electric travel. Larger battery packs allow longer travel on electrical energy, but production and weight of underutilized batteries result in higher GHG emissions. Under the current average U.S. grid mix, PHEVs offer a nearly 50% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions relative to equivalent conventional vehicles and about 5% improvement over HEVs when driven on the standard urban driving cycle. Optimal allocation of different PHEVs to different drivers turns out to be of second order importance for minimizing net life cycle GHGs. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","global optimization; global warming; greenhouse gas emissions; life cycle assessment; MINLP; plug-in hybrid electric vehicle; transportation; vehicle design","Battery pack; Branch-and-reduce algorithms; Driving cycle; Electrical energy; GHG emission; Global solutions; life cycle assessment; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Local-search algorithms; MINLP; Multistart; Nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Optimal allocation; Optimal design; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Plug-in hybrids; Second orders; vehicle design; Algorithms; Design; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Global optimization; Global warming; Integer programming; Life cycle; Optimization; Greenhouse gases",,,,,,"Bandivadekar, A., Bodek, K., Cheah, L., Evans, C., Groode, T., Heywood, J., Kasseris, E., Weiss, M., (2008) On the Road in 2035: Reducing Transportation's Petroleum Consumption and GHG Emissions, , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; Shiau, C.-S.N., Kaushal, N., Hendrickson, C.T., Peterson, S.B., Whitacre, J.F., Michalek, J.J., (2010) A Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Model for Deterministic Global Optimization of Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle Design and Allocation, , ASME 2010 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Frank, A.A., Plug-in hybrid vehicles for a sustainable future (2007) American Scientist, 95 (2), pp. 158-165; Samaras, C., Meisterling, K., Life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from plug-in hybrid vehicles: Implications for policy (2008) Environ.
