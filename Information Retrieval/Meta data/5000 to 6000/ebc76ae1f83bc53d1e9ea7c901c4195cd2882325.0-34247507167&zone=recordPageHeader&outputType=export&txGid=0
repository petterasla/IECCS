This paper describes the landfilling sub-model used in the life-cycle assessment program EASEWASTE, and examines some of the implications of this sub-model. All quantities and concentrations of leachate and landfill gas can be modified by the user in order to bring them in agreement with the actual landfill that is assessed by the model. All emissions, except the generation of landfill gas, are process specific. The landfill gas generation is calculated on the basis of organic matter in the landfilled waste. A landfill assessment example is provided. For this example, the normalised environmental effects of landfill gas on global warming and photochemical smog are much greater than the environmental effects for landfill leachate or for landfill construction. A sensitivity analysis for this example indicates that the overall environmental impact is sensitive to the gas collection efficiency and the use of the gas, but not to the amount of leachate generated, or the amount of soil or liner material used in construction. The landfill model can be used for evaluating different technologies with different liners, gas and leachate collection efficiencies, and to compare the environmental consequences of landfilling with alternative waste treatment options such as incineration or anaerobic digestion. © 2006.",,"Concentration (process); Environmental impact; Global warming; Land fill; Life cycle; Mathematical models; Gas generation; Landfill model; Solid waste management systems; Solid wastes; Concentration (process); Environmental impact; Global warming; Land fill; Life cycle; Mathematical models; Solid wastes; assessment method; emission; environmental impact; environmental modeling; landfill; leachate; solid waste; waste management; waste treatment; article; computer program; environmental impact; gas waste; greenhouse effect; landfill; leaching; life cycle; life cycle assessment; model; photochemical smog; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; solid waste management; Air Pollutants; Environment; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"Air Pollutants; Methane, 74-82-8; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"Astrup, T., Mosbæk, H., Christensen, T.H., Estimating long-term leaching from waste incineration air-pollution-control residues (2006) Waste Management, 26, pp. 803-814; Barlaz, M.A., Kaplan, P.O., Ranjithan, S.R., Rynk, R., Evaluating environmental impacts of solid waste management alternatives (2003) Biocycle, 2003 (October), pp. 52-55; Camobreco, V., Ham, R., Barlaz, M., Repa, E., Felker, M., Rousseau, C., Rathle, J., Life cycle inventory of a modern municipal solid waste landfill (1999) Waste Management & Research, 17 (6), pp. 394-408; Dalemo, M., Sonesson, U., Björklund, A., Mingarini, A., Frostell, B., Jönsson, H., Nybrant, T., Thyselius, L., ORWARE - a simulation model for organic waste handling system (1997) Resources Conservation & Recycling, 21, pp. 17-37; Eleazer, W.E., Odle, W.S., Wang, Y.-S., Barlaz, M.A., Biodegradability of municipal solid waste components in laboratory scale landfills (1997) Environmental Science & Technology, 31 (3), pp. 911-917; Hamzawi, N., Kennedy, K.J., McLean, D.D., Technical feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of sewage and municipal solid waste (1998) Environmental Technology, 19, pp. 993-1003; Integrated solid waste management decision-support-tool (ISWM DST), (2001) A Spreadsheet based Optimisation Model, , US EPA; North Carolina State University; Research Triangle Institute; Kjeldsen, P., Barlaz, M.A., Rooker, A.P., Baun, A., Ledin, A., Christensen, T.H., Present and long-term composition of MSW landfill leachate: a review (2002) Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, 32 (4); Mandal, T., Mandal, N.K., Comparative study of biogas production from different waste materials (1997) Energy Conversion and Management, 38 (7), pp. 679-683; McDougall, F.R., White, P., Francke, M., Hindle, P., (2001) Integrated solid waste management - a lifecycle inventory 2, , Procter & Gamble, Blackwell Science Ltd., London, UK; Wang, Y.-S., Odle, W.S., Eleazer, W.E., Barlaz, M.A., Methane potential of food waste and anaerobic toxicty of leachate produced during food waste decomposition (1997) Waste Management & Research, 15 (2), pp. 149-167; Wenzel, H., Hauschild, M., Alting, L., Environmental assessment of products (1997) Methodology, tools and case studies in product development, 1. , Kluwer Academic Publishers., Hingham, MA, USA","Christensen, T.H.; Environment and Resources, Technical University of Denmark, DTU, Building 113, DK-2800 Kgs Lyngby, Denmark; email: thc@er.dtu.dk",,,,,,,,0956053X,,WAMAE,17382531,"English","Waste Manage.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247507167
