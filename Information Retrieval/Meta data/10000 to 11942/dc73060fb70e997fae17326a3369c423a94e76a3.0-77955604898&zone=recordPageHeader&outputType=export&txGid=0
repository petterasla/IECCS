The current study is a sensitivity analysis that uses a network solver to quantify energy savings due to the alteration of three system properties system-wide water demand, storage tank parameters (maximum water level, diameter, elevation), and pumping stations (horsepower, number of boosters, and their locations) of seven diverse MDWDSs. It was found that a 50% reduction in water demand, main pump horsepower, and booster horsepower resulted in an average energy savings of 47, 41, and 9.5% respectively, for the seven systems analyzed. Other properties examined showed insignificant savings. Even though an individual system analysis is more conclusive, this sensitivity analysis can guide optimization studies to focus on the most sensitive properties. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Climate change; Distribution; Drinking water; Energy; Storage; Sustainability","climate change; drinking water; energy use; greenhouse gas; optimization; sensitivity analysis; sustainability; urban area; water demand; water supply",,,,,,"Arora, H., Lechevallier, M.W., Energy management opportunities (1998) Journal of American Water Works Association, 90 (2), p. 40; Arpke, A., Hutzler, N., Operational life-cycle assessment and life-cycle cost analysis for water use in multioccupant buildings (2005) Journal of Architectural Engineering, 11 (3), pp. 99-109; Technology & Practice American Water Works Association-Streamlines, 1 (7). , http://www.awwa.org/publications/StreamlinesArticle.cfm?itemnumber1/447308, AWWA, March 31, (accessed on 4/1/09); Babayan, A.V., Savic, D.A., Walters, G.A., Kapelan, Z.S., Robust least-cost design of water distribution networks using redundancy and integration-based methodologies (2007) Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 133 (1), pp. 67-97; Brion, L.M., Mays, L.W., Methodology for optimal operation of pumping stations in water distribution systems (1991) Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 117 (11), pp. 1551-1569; Chase, D.V., Operation of water distribution systems (2000) Water Distribution Systems Handbook, pp. 1-16. , In: Mays, L.W., editor, New York: McGraw-Hill; Colombo, A.F., Karney, B.W., Energy and costs of leaky pipes: Towards comprehensive picture (2001) Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, 128 (6), pp. 441-450; Crowe, C.T., Elger, F.D., Roberson, A., (2001) Engineering Fluid Mechanics, , 7th ed.
