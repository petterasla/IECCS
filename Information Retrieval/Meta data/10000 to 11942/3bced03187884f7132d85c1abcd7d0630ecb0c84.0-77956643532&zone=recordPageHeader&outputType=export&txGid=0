Because there are no instrumental records of such historical temperature data, climatologists have been interested in reconstructing historical temperatures using various proxy time series. In this paper, the authors examine a state-space model approach for historical temperature reconstruction which not only makes use of the proxy data but also information on external forcings. A challenge in the implementation of this approach is the estimation of the parameters in the state-space model. The authors developed two maximum likelihood methods for parameter estimation and studied the efficiency and asymptotic properties of the associated estimators through a combination of theoretical and numerical investigations. © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada.","Kalman filter; State-space model; Temperature reconstruction",,,,,,,"Briffa, K.R., Osborn, T.J., Schweingruber, F.H., Harris, I.C., Jones, P.D., Shiyatov, S.G., Vaganov, E.A., Low-frequency temperature variations from a northern tree-ring density network (2001) Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, pp. 2929-2941; Brohan, P., Kennedy, J.J., Haris, I., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, P.D., Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: A new dataset from 1850 (2006) Journal of Geophysical Research, 111, pp. D12106; Brown, B.M., Martingale central limit theorems (1971) Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 42, pp. 59-66; Dempster, A.P., Laird, N.M., Rubin, D.B., Maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data via the EM algorithm (with discussion) (1977) Journal of Royal Statistical Society, 9, pp. 1-38. , Series B; Durbin, J., Koopman, S.J., (2001) Time Series Analysis By State Space Methods, p. 253. , Oxford University Press, New York; Esper, J., Cook, E.R., Schweinngruber, F.H., Low-frequency in long treering chronologies for reconstruction past temperature variability (2002) Science, 295, pp. 2250-2253; Harvey, A., (1989) Forecasting, Structural Time Series Models and The Kalman Filter, p. 554. , Cambridge University Press, New York; Hegerl, G.C., Crowley, T.J., Allen, M.R., Hyde, W.T., Pollack, H.N., Smerdon, J.E., Zorita, E., Detection of human influence on a new, validated 1500 year temperature reconstruction (2007) Journal of Climate, 20, pp. 650-666; Hegerl, G.C., Zwiers, F.W., Braconnot, P., Gillett, N.P., Luo, Y., Marengo, O.J.A., Nicholls, N., Stott, P.A., Understanding and Attributing Climate Change (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
