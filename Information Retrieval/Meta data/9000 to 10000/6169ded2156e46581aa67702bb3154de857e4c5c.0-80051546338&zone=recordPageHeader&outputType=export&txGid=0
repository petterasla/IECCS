The most common method used for BD production is based on the alkali-catalyzed transesterification of first-use refined oils and fats with an alcohol (e.g. methanol). These technologies, however, require significant modification when applied to second use materials such as greases because of their higher free fatty acid (FFA) content. Recently, we reported a series of insoluble porous polymer grafted diphenylammonium salts that efficiently esterified the FFA in greases to FAME. In this work, the dipheny- lammonium salts were supported onto two robust meso- porous silicas. The resulting catalysts had high esterification activity with >99% of the FFA in greases converted to FAME, and the FFA content in the treated greases was reduced to < 1 wt%. The mesoporous silica- supported catalysts displayed minimal transesterification activity. © 2009 AOCS.","Biodiesel; Brown grease; Diphenyl- ammonium salts; Esterification; Fatty acid methyl esters; Free fatty acid; Heterogeneous catalysts; Yellow grease","Ammonium salt; Brown grease; Fatty acid methyl esters; Free fatty acid; Heterogeneous catalyst; Yellow grease; Acids; Ammonium compounds; Biodiesel; Catalyst activity; Diesel fuels; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Global warming; Lubricating greases; Methanol; Oils and fats; Petroleum refining; Salts; Silica; Catalyst supports",,,,,,"Hill, J., Nelson, E., Tilman, D., Polasky, S., Tiffany, D., Environmental, economic, and energetic costs and benefits of biodiesel and ethanol biofuels (2006) PNAS, 103, pp. 11206-11210; Knothe, G., Krahl, J., Van Gerpen, J., (2005) The Biodiesel Handbook, , AOCS press, Champaign; Haas, M.J., McAloon, A.J., Yee, W.C., Foglia, T.A., A process model to estimate biodiesel production costs (2006) Bioresour Technol, 97, pp. 671-678; Canakci, M., Gerpen, J.V., Biodiesel production from oils and fats with high free fatty acids (2001) Trans ASAE, 44, pp. 1429-1436; Kulkarni, M.G., Dalai, A.K., Waste cooking oil-an economical source for biodiesel: A review (2006) Ind Eng Chem Res, 45, pp. 2901-2913; Canakci, M., Van Gerpen, J.H., Comparison of engine performance and emissions for petroleum diesel fuel, yellow grease biodiesel, and soybean oil biodiesel (2003) Trans ASAE, 46, pp. 937-944; Canakci, M., Van Gerpen, J., A pilot plant to produce bio- diesel from high free fatty acid feedstocks (2003) Trans ASAE, 46, pp. 945-954; Lotero, E., Liu, Y., Lopez, D.E., Suwannakarn, K., Bruce, D.A., Goodwin, J.G., Synthesis of biodiesel via acid catalysis (2005) Ind Eng Chem Res, 44, pp. 5353-5363; Kiss, A.A., Rothenberg, G., Dimian, A.C., Solid acid catalysts for biodiesel production-towards sustainable energy (2006) Adv Synth Catal, 348, pp. 75-81; Kiss, A.A., Dimian, A.C., Rotherberg, G., Biodiesel by catalytic reactive distillation powered by metal oxides (2008) Energy Fuels, 22, pp. 598-604; Kiss, A.A., Omota, F., Dimian, A.C., Rothenberg, G., The heterogeneous advantage: Biodiesel by catalytic reactive distillation (2006) Top Catal, 40, pp. 141-150; Chung, K.-H., Chang, D.R., Park, B.G., Removal of free fatty acid in waste frying oil by esterification with methanol on zeolite catalysts (2008) Bioresour Technol (In Press); Zafiropoulos, N.A., Ngo, H.L., Foglia, T.A., Samulski, E.T., Lin, W., Catalytic synthesis of biodiesel from high free fatty acid- containing feedstocks (2007) Chem Commun, 35, pp. 3670-3672; Ngo, H.L., Zafiropoulos, N.A., Foglia, T.A., Samulski, E.T., Lin, W., Efficient two-step synthesis of biodiesel from greases (2008) Energy Fuels, 22, pp. 626-634; Kresge, C.T., Leonowicz, M.E., Roth, W.J., Vartuli, J.C., Beck, J.S., Ordered mesoporous molecular sieves synthesized by a liquid- crystal template mechanism (1992) Nature, 359, pp. 710-712; Mbaraka, I.K., Radu, D.R., Lin, V.S.-L., Shanks, B.H., Organo-sulfonic acid-functionalized mesoporous silica's for the esterification of fatty acid (2003) J Catal, 219, pp. 329-336; Mbaraka, I.K., Shanks, B.H., Conversion of oils and fats using advanced mesoporous heterogeneous catalysts (2006) J Am Oil Chem Soc, 83, pp. 79-91; Vs-Y, L., Nieweg, J.A., Kern, C., Trewyn, B.G., Wiench, J.W., Pruski, M., Acid-base mesoporous calcia-silica catalysts for cooperative conversion of bio-based feedstocks into biodiesel (2006) PrEPR Symp Am Chem Soc Div Fuel Chem, 51, pp. 426-427; Lin, V.S.-Y., Radu, D.R., (2006) Use of Functionalized Mesoporous Silicates to Esterify Fatty Acids and Transesterify Oils, , US Patent 7,122,688; Barrett, E.P., Joyner, L.G., Halenda, P.P., The determination of pore volume and area distributions in porous substances.
