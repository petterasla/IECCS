Different engine configurations were tested, keeping in consideration the necessity to ensure suitable performance, and to meet the European regulations. With the target torque and power, the severe European limits were not met only for methane emissions. In addition, the GWI (global warming impact) values were also computed and compared with proposed limits expressly conceived for natural gas engines. The results showed that the NG lean burn engine at the present state of development does not appear able to meet the future requirements of both low NOx emissions and GWI, because of the difficulty of resolving the trade-off between NOx and HC.","European emission limits; Global warming impact; Lean burn engine; Natural gas","Air pollution control; Buses; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Methane; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Regulatory compliance; Heavy duty vehicles; Lean burn natural gas engines; Gas engines",,,,,,"Bellini, V., Gambino, M., Melloni, E., Project for ecological public transport and service vehicles for the city of Florence (1992) 25th Isata Silver Jubilee International Symposium on Automotive Technology and Automation, pp. 245-252. , Florence, Italy, Paper 920434; Ciambelli, P., Corbo, P., Gambino, M., Migliardini, F., Minelli, G., Moretti, G., Porta, P., The effect of preparation and streaming on the catalytic properties of Cu- and Co-ZSM5 in lean NOx reduction' (1995) Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, 97, pp. 295-302; Corbo, P., Gambino, M., Iannaccone, S., Methane dedicated catalysts for heavy-duty natural gas engines (1996) SAE Spring Fuels & Lubricants Meeting, , Michigan, SAE Paper 961087; Gambino, M., Iannaccone, S., Unich, A., Heavy-duty spark ignition engines fueled with methane (1991) J.
