This nonirrigated field study was conducted from 1997 through 2002, which coincided with the 1998-2002 drought that affected most of the United States. The objective was to determine the effect of rotation and tillage on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) productivity. Treatments in the study were rotation [cotton rotated with corn (Zea mays L.), cotton planted aft er a rye (Secale cereale L.) winter cover crop, and continuous cotton with no cover crop] and tillage system (conventional tillage and conservation tillage). Two levels of aldicarb [2-methyl-2-(methylthio)propanal O-{(methylamino)carbonyl}oxime] (0 and 1.18 kg a.i. ha-1) were also included because of known soil management effects on thrips (Frankliniella sp.) and root-knot nematodes (Meloidigyne incognita). The predominant soil types were Bonneau loamy sand (loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult) and Norfolk loamy sand (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudult). Rotation did not affect cotton yield in any year. Tillage did not affect cotton yield in 1997. Conservation tillage resulted in an average 25% yield increase in cotton lint yield over conventional tillage during the 5-yr drought. Tillage and aldicarb affected both thrips and root-knot nematodes, but lack of interaction among these factors for lint yield suggested that management of these pests was not the predominant cause for the cotton yield increase with conservation tillage. Conservation tillage for cotton production could be an important method to help mitigate the effects of climate change in the region if change occurs as predicted. © 2010 by the American Society of Agronomy.",,"[carbonyl; Aldicarb; Conservation tillage; Conventional tillage; Corn (Zea mays L.); Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.); Cotton lints; Cotton production; Cotton yield; Cover crops; Field studies; Global climate changes; Lint yield; Loamy sand; Propanal; Root knot nematode; Secale cereale; Soil management; Soil types; Tillage system; Yield increase; Agricultural machinery; Agronomy; Climate change; Crops; Drought; Insecticides; Rotation; Soil conservation; Soils; Cotton; Frankliniella; Gossypium hirsutum; Meloidogyne; Meloidogyne javanica; Secale cereale; Zea mays",,,,,,"All, J.N., Tanner, B.H., Roberts, P.M., Influence of no-tillage on tobacco thrips infestations in cotton (1992) Proc. of the 1992 Southern Conservation Tillage Conf.
