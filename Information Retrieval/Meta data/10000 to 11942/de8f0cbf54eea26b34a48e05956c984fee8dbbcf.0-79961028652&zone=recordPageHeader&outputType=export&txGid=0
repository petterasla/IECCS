Artisanal fisheries in rivers produce 60%. Forty percent are landed in trawl fisheries at sea. The shrimp from both fisheries result in a frozen, consumer-packed product that is exported to Europe. We applied attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impact of the two supply chains and identify improvement options. In addition to standard LCA impact categories, biological impacts of each fishery were quantified with regard to landed by-catch, discard, seafloor impact, and size of target catch. Results for typical LCA categories include that artisanal fisheries have much lower inputs and emissions in the fishing phase than does the industrial fishery. For the product from artisanal fisheries, the main part of the impact in the standard LCA categories occurs during processing on land, mainly due to the use of heavy fuel oil and refrigerants with high global warming and ozone depletion potentials. From a biological point of view, each fishery has advantages and drawbacks, and a number of improvement options were identified. If developing countries can ensure biological sustainability of their fisheries and design the chain on land in a resource-efficient way, long distance to markets is not an obstacle to sustainable trading of seafood products originating in artisanal fisheries. © 2011 by Yale University.","Discard; Energy use; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Seafloor; Seafood; Trawl","Discard; Energy use; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Sea floor; Seafood; Trawl; Developing countries; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Fuel oils; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Ozone; Ozone layer; Shellfish; Supply chains; Fisheries; artisanal fishery; bycatch; developing world; emission inventory; energy use; environmental impact assessment; export; fishery discard; global warming; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; industrial practice; life cycle analysis; ozone depletion; seafloor; seafood; shrimp culture; sustainable development; trade-environment relations; trawling; Senegal; Decapoda (Crustacea); Farfantepenaeus notialis",,,,,,"Ackefors, H., The evolution of a worldwide shrimp industry (2009) World Aquaculture, 40 (3), pp. 46-48. , 50-55; Baumann, H., Tillman, A.-M., (2004) The hitch-hikers guide to LCA, , Lund, Sweden: Studentlitteratur; Ellingsen, H., Aanondsen, S.A., Environmental impact of wild caught cod and farmed salmon: A comparison with chicken (2006) International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 11 (1), pp. 60-65; Emanuelsson, A., (2008), Bycatch and discard in Senegalese artisanal and industrial fisheries for southern pink shrimp (Penaeus notialis).
