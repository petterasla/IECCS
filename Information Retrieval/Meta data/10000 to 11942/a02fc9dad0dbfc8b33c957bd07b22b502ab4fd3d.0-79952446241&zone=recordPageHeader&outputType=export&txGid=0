It is widely assumed that soils with a higher fungal biomass have lower N losses, but this relationship has never been experimentally confirmed. With the increased interest in soil-based ecosystem services and sustainable management of soils, such a relationship would be relevant for agricultural management. Here we present a first attempt to test this relationship experimentally. We used intact soil columns from two plots from a field experiment that had consistent differences in fungal biomass (68 ± 8 vs. 111 ± 9 μg C g-1) as a result of different fertilizer history (80 vs. 40 kg N ha-1 y-1 as farm yard manure), while other soil properties were very similar. We performed two greenhouse experiments: in the main experiment the columns received either mineral fertilizer N or no N (control). We measured N leaching, N2O emission and denitrification from the columns during 4 weeks, after which we analyzed fungal and bacterial biomass and soil N pools. In the additional 15N experiment we traced added N in leachates, soil, plants and microbial biomass. We found that in the main experiment, N2O emission and denitrification were lower in the high fungal biomass soil, irrespective of the addition of fertilizer N. Higher 15N recovery in the high fungal biomass soil also indicated lower N losses through dentrification. In the main experiment, N leaching after fertilizer addition showed a 3-fold increase compared to the control in low fungal biomass soil (11.9 ± 1.0 and 3.9 ± 1.0 kg N ha-1, respectively), but did not increase in high fungal biomass soil (6.4 ± 0.9 after N addition vs. 4.5 ± 0.8 kg N ha-1 in the control). Thus, in the high fungal biomass soil more N was immobilized. However, the 15N experiment did not confirm these results; N leaching was higher in high fungal biomass soil, even though this soil showed higher immobilization of 15N into microbial biomass. However, only 3% of total 15N was found in the microbial biomass 2 weeks after the mineral fertilization. Most of the recovered 15N was found in plants (approximately 25%) and soil organic matter (approximately 15%), and these amounts did not differ between the high and the low fungal biomass soil. Our main experiment confirmed the assumption of lower N losses in a soil with higher fungal biomass. The additional 15N experiment showed that higher fungal biomass is probably not the direct cause of higher N retention, but rather the result of low nitrogen availability. Both experiments confirmed that higher fungal biomass can be considered as an indicator of higher nitrogen retention in soils. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Bacteria; Denitrification; Food webs; Fungi; Grassland; Leaching; Nitrogen; Retention","Agricultural grasslands; Agricultural management; Atmospheric pollution; Bacterial biomass; Dentrification; Ecosystem services; Field experiment; Food webs; Fungal biomass; Grassland; Grassland soils; Greenhouse experiments; Leachates; Microbial biomass; Mineral fertilization; Mineral fertilizers; Nitrogen availability; Nitrogen loss; Nitrogen retention; Retention; Soil column; Soil organic matters; Soil property; Sustainable management; Air pollution; Bacteriology; Biomass; Denitrification; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Fungi; Global warming; Lakes; Leaching; Manures; Nitrogen; Silicate minerals; Soil testing; Soils; Experiments; agricultural runoff; biomass; denitrification; ecosystem service; eutrophication; experimental study; fertilizer application; fungus; global warming; grassland soil; immobilization; leaching; nitrogen cycle; nutrient availability; nutrient loss; soil column; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; sustainability; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",,,,,,"Amelung, W., Lobe, I., Du Preez, C.C., Fate of microbial residues in sandy soils of the South African highveld as influenced by prolonged arable cropping (2002) European Journal of Soil Science, 53, pp. 29-35; Bakken, L.R., Olsen, R.A., Buoyant densities and dry-matter contents of microorganisms: conversion of a measured biovolume into biomass bacteria and fungi from soil (1983) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 45, pp. 1188-1195; Bardgett, R.D., McAlister, E., The measurement of soil fungal:bacterial biomass ratios as an indicator of ecosystem self-regulation in temperate meadow grasslands (1999) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 29, pp. 282-290; Bardgett, R.D., Frankland, J.C., Whittaker, J.B., The effects of agricultural management on the soil biota of some upland grasslands (1993) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 45, pp. 25-45; Bardgett, R.D., Mawdsley, J.L., Edwards, S., Hobbs, P.J., Rodwell, J.S., Davies, W.J., Plant species and nitrogen effects on soil biological properties of temperate upland grasslands (1999) Functional Ecology, 13, pp. 650-660; Bardgett, R.D., Streeter, T.C., Bol, R., Soil microbes compete effectively with plants for organic-nitrogen inputs to temperate grasslands (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 1277-1287; Bardgett, R.D., Smith, R.S., Shiel, R.S., Peacock, S., Simkin, J.M., Quirk, H., Hobbs, P.J., Parasitic plants indirectly regulate below-ground properties in grassland ecosystems (2006) Nature, 439, pp. 969-972; Bloem, J., Vos, A., Fluorescent staining of microbes for total direct counts (2004) Molecular Microbial Ecology Manual, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, G.A.
