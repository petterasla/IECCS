G1V 4C7, Canada","To assess the responses and plasticity of white spruce seedlings (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) to high temperatures, 12 open-pollinated families differing in growth performance were exposed to a 30-min heat treatment of 42, 44, 46, 48, or 50 °C with or without heat preconditioning at 38 °C for 5h. Damage was evaluated based on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters after heat preconditioning, after the heat treatments and during a 7-day recovery period. Visible needle damage was also evaluated after the heat treatments and 14 days later. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicated that seedlings subjected to a heat treatment of 42-43 °C lost the ability to phosphorylate and donate water to photosystem II (PSII). A heat treatment of 44-46 °C severely limited the ability of the seedlings to use NADPH and ATP in the Calvin cycle, Based on visible needle damage, families with superior height-growth performance were more sensitive to heat stress than families with intermediate or inferior height-growth performance. Moreover, families with superior height-growth performance had low photochemical efficiencies in the light (ΔFIFḿ) after heat treatment. Heat preconditioning increased the thermotolerance of the seedlings, However, the data suggest that white spruce seedlings exhibiting fast-growing characteristics under present conditions may not grow as well at higher temperatures.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Global change; Global warming; Heat damage; Heat stress; High temperature; Photosystem II,; Picea glauca; Thermotolerance","climate change; coniferous tree; selective breeding; temperature tolerance; Picea glauca",,,,,,"Aleksandrov, V.I., Cytophysiological and cytoecological investigation of heat resistance of plant cells toward the action of high and low temperature (1964) Quart.
