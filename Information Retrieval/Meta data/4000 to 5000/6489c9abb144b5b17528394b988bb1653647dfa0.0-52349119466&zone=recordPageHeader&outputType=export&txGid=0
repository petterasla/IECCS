Now there seems consensus among industrialized and developing countries to control and reduce the CO2 emissions, the main component of green house gases. Time has come for both research institutes and industries to follow an environmental sustainable path and develop new technologies based on renewable biomass independent of fossil fuels. Among various products, the bioplastics and natural fiber composites represent a significant potential of growth and success by utilizing renewable feedstock. In this review paper, both these industrial sectors have been chosen for a critical study on the current R&amp;D efforts, future opportunities and challenges.",,"Chemical industry; Climate change; Paper and pulp industry; Annual meetings; Bio-refinery; Chemical-; Preprints; Pulp and Paper Technical Association of Canada; Developing countries; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Climates; Ecosystems; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Paper Industry; Petrolatum; Pulp Industry; Renewable Resources",,,,,,"White, K., Gunther, P., Acton White Associates Inc http://www.actonwhite.ca(2005) Canadian Plastic Products Industry, , http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inplastics-plastiques.nsf/en/p101383e.html#1; Baumann, M., History of Plastics Industry and Future Trends.
