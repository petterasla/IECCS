Localized activities have led to the degradation of the natural environment on a regional scale. These processes include 1) transfer of pollutants by water and atmosphere; 2) expansion and merging of oil and gas development sites; 3) degradation of the key wildlife habitats (reproduction sites of fish, mammals, birds, migration routes, etc.); and 4) more intensive use of remaining pastures and hunting areas by the indigenous population due to loss of large areas of pasture and hunting territories to the oil and gas industries. The situation will continue to worsen unless there is significant improvement in land-use management and technology. -from Authors",,"habitat quality; pasture; pollution; wildlife; Russian Federation, Tyumen Oblast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027072112
