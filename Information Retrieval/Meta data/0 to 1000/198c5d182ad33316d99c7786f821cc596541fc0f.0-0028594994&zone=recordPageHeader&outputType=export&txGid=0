The behavioral model consistently predicts that E. mordax grows much more slowly than would be expected with a pure, net-energy intake rate maximization strategy. The reduced growth rates could result from the fish avoiding zooplankton patches, where they are under increased predation risk, by swimming slowly in the waters between zooplankton patches. The combinations of growth rates and daily instantaneous mortality rates generated by the behavioral model are internally consistent with a Lefkovitch matrix population model, which includes an early juvenile stage of a stable and stationary population. Several novel and testable predictions are made by the behavioral model, including: (1) anchovies swim very slowly between zooplankton patch encounters; (2) within a patch fish swim very rapidly while searching for prey; and (3) fish often leave zooplankton patches before totally filling their stomachs. Given these encouraging initial results, the behavioral modeling approach appears to be a valuable technique for examining how potential habitat changes due to global warming may affect fish behavior and populations. Several such scenarios are proposed and discussed. © 1994.",,"Lefkovitch matrix population model; northern anchovy; patch exploitation; schooling; Engraulis mordax; Anchoa",,,,,,"Abrahams, Dill, A determination of the energetic equivalence of the risk of predation (1989) Ecology, 70, pp. 999-1007; Beamish, Swimming metabolism and temperature in juvenile walleye, Stizostedion vitreum vitreum (1990) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 27, pp. 309-314; Beers, Stewart, Micro- Zooplankton in the Euphotic Zone at Five Locations Across the California Current (1967) Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada, 24, pp. 2053-2068; Bindman, The 1985 spawning biomass of the northern anchovy (1986) CalCOFI Reports, 27, pp. 16-24; Blaxter, Hunter, The biology of the clupeoid fishes (1982) Advances in marine biology, 20, pp. 1-223. , J.H.S.
