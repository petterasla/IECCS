The project is one of five within the Glowa research program (www.glowa.org) dealing with Global Change effects on the water cycle in six meso-scale catchments (up to 100,000 km2) in Central Europe, West Africa and the Middle East. In the Glowa-Danube project, 16 natural science and socio-economic simulation models are integrated in the coupled simulation system Danubia. This article describes the underlying concept and implementation of WaterSupply, a multiactor-based model of the water supply sector with a focus on water resource utilization and distribution of individual water supply companies. Within Danubia, WaterSupply represents the link between water supply and demand, where the former is simulated by a groundwater and a surface water model and the latter by water consumption models of four different sectors (domestic, industrial, agricultural and tourism). WaterSupply interprets the quantitative state of water resources for defined spatial and temporal units according to sustainability requirements and assesses the state of resources in relation to present water supply schemes and the dynamics of user demand. WaterSupply then seeks both to optimize the resource use of supply companies and to identify critical regions for which further adaptation of the water supply scheme will become necessary under changing climatic conditions. In this article, a brief description of the Glowa-Danube project and the integrated simulation system Danubia is followed by a short presentation of the DeepActor framework, which provides a common conceptual and technical basis for the socio-economic simulation models of Glowa-Danube. The main body of the article is devoted to the concept, the implementation and simulation results of WaterSupply. Results from different scenario calculations demonstrate the capabilities and the potential fields of application of the model. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Danube; DANUBIA; Global change; Integrated water resources management; Multi-actor approach; WaterSupply model","Austria; Central Europe; Climatic conditions; Coupled simulation; Critical region; DANUBIA; Germany; Global change; Global climate changes; Integrated simulations; Integrated strategy; Integrated Water Resources Management; Interdisciplinary project; Land-use management; Mesoscale; Middle East; Potential field; Research programs; Resource use; Simulation result; Socio-economics; User demands; Water consumption; Water cycle; Water resource utilization; Water supply schemes; Water supply sector; West Africa; Catchments; Climate change; Competition; Economics; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Land use; Runoff; Water supply; Water supply systems; Water resources; climate change; computer simulation; demand analysis; global change; integrated approach; interdisciplinary approach; numerical model; research program; strategic approach; sustainability; water management; water resource; water supply; water use; Danube River",,,,,,"Alvisi, S., Franchini, M., Marinelli, A., A stochastic model for representing drinking water demand at residential level (2003) Water Resour Manag, 17 (3), pp. 197-222. , doi:10.1023/A:1024100518186; Apfelbeck, J., Huigen, M., Krimly, T., (2007) The Importance of Spatial, Temporal and Social Scales in Integrated Modeling; Simulating the Effects of Climatic Change on District-and Farm-Level Decision Making in the Danube Catchment Area, , http://purl.umn.edu/7984, 81st Annual Conference, April 2-4, 2007, Reading University, UK; Athanasiadis, I., Mentes, A., Mitkas, P., Mylopoulos, Y., A hybrid agent-based model for estimating residential water demand (2005) Simulation, 81 (3), pp. 175-187; Axtell, R., (2000) Why Agents?
