Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) seems to be one of the most drought-tolerant pine species. Nevertheless, the existence of geographical trends in their genetic differentiation indicates potentially large differences in drought-tolerance among provenances. This assumption was verified by the finding of large variation among provenances in their internal water relations. Hence, the aim of this study was to compare the ecophysiological behaviour of several Aleppo pine provenances under contrasting climatic conditions. Growth parameters (height and diameter) and survival rate were measured in two provenance trials, one planted under sub-desertic conditions at the northern edge of the Negev desert, and the second under thermo-Mediterranean climatic conditions in the central coastal plains, Israel. Ecophysiological parameters such as: predawn needle water potential, sap flow in the xylem (i.e. transpiration), photosynthesis and water-use efficiency were measured in trees of selected provenances. The results suggest that it is not possible to predict provenance performance under harsh conditions from their performance under more favourable ones. Therefore, selection must be carried out under the exact conditions in which the trees from the resultant selection will be planted. The present study clearly emphasises the need for broad selection programs of P. halepensis.","Drought tolerance; Ecotypes-genotypes; Global climate change; Selection","climate change; drought; drought resistance; ecophysiology; tree; Asia; Coastal Plain; Eurasia; Israel; Middle East; Negev; Southern District; Coniferophyta; Pinus halepensis",,,,,,"Bariteau, M., Huc, R., Vendramin, G.G., (2002) Adaptation and Selection of Mediterranean Pinus and Cedrus for Sustainable Afforestation of Marginal Lands, , Final report to research contract No. FAIR CT95-0097, Commission of the European Communities; Borghetti, M., Cinnirella, S., Magnani, F., Saracino, A., Impact of long-term drought on xylem embolism and growth in Pinus halepensis (1998) Trees, 12, pp. 187-195; Calamassi, R., Rocca, G.D., Falusi, M., Paoletti, E., Strati, S., Resistance to water stress in seedlings of eight European provenances of Pinus halepens Mill (2001) Annals of Forest Sciences, 58, pp. 663-672; Cohen, A., Magaritz, M., Graber, M., Workshop summary (1993) Regional Implications of Future Climate Change, pp. 1-5. , Graber M.
