A two-speed procedure using objective analysis was used to identify outliers. The first step was a temporal check that determines if a particular monthly value is consistent with other monthly values for the same station. The second step utilizes six different spatial interpolation techniques to estimate each monthly time series. For both temperature and precipitation, a multiple regression scheme was found to be the best estimator for the majority of records. Results from the two steps are merged, and a combined set of quality control flags are generated. -from Authors",,"climate data quality; objective data analysis; outlier detection",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08948763,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029503477
