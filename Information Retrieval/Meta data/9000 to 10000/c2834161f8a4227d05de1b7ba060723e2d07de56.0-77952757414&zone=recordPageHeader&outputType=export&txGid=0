The methane flux varied between 0.04 and 0.93 mg m-2 hr1 in bare soil and transplanting of rice crop doubled the methane flux (0.07 to 206 mg m-2hr -2 hr1). Among rice cultivars, significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher amount of methane was emitted from Pusa 44 compared to PR 118 and PR 111. Application of organic materials enhanced methane emission from rice fields andresultedin increased soil organic carbon content. The greatest seasonal methane flux was observed in wheat straw amended plots (229.6 kg ha -1) followed by farmyard manure (111.6 kg ha-1), green manure (85.4 kg ha-1) and the least from rice straw compost amended plots (36.9 kg ha-1) as compared to control (21.5 kg ha -1). The differential effect of organic materials in enhancing methane flux was related to total carbon or C:N ratio of the material. The results showed that incorporation of humified organic matter such as rice straw compost could minimize methane emission from rice fields with co-benefits of increased soil fertility and crop productivity. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).","Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane flux; Organic materials; Rice cultivar","carbon; methane; agricultural emission; carbon flux; crop production; cultivar; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; organic matter; paddy field; rice; sandy loam; soil emission; soil fertility; straw; agriculture; air; article; biomass; climate change; rice; soil; species difference; Agriculture; Air; Biomass; Carbon; Climate Change; Methane; Oryza sativa; Soil; Species Specificity; India; Punjab [India]; Pusa; Triticum aestivum",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; methane, 74-82-8; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Methane, 74-82-8; Soil",,,,"Adhya, T.K., Rath, A.K., Gupta, P.K., Rao, V.R., Das, S.N., Parida, K.M., Parashar, D.C., Sethunathan, N., Methane emission from flooded rice fields under irrigated conditions (1994) Biol Fertil.
