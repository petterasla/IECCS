So far, these impacts have not been addressed in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA). Here, we derived characterization factors for water consumption and global warming based on freshwater fish species loss. Calculation of characterization factors for potential freshwater fish losses from water consumption were estimated using a generic species-river discharge curve for 214 global river basins. We also derived characterization factors for potential freshwater fish species losses per unit of greenhouse gas emission. Based on five global climate scenarios, characterization factors for 63 greenhouse gas emissions were calculated. Depending on the river considered, characterization factors for water consumption can differ up to 3 orders of magnitude. Characterization factors for greenhouse gas emissions can vary up to 5 orders of magnitude, depending on the atmospheric residence time and radiative forcing efficiency of greenhouse gas emissions. An emission of 1 ton of CO2 is expected to cause the same impact on potential fish species disappearance as the water consumption of 10-1000 m3, depending on the river basin considered. Our results make it possible to compare the impact of water consumption with greenhouse gas emissions. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric residence time; Discharge curves; Fish species; Freshwater ecosystem; Freshwater fishes; Global climates; Life-cycle assessments; Orders of magnitude; Per unit; Radiative forcing efficiency; River basins; Species richness; Water consumption; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Ecosystems; Fish; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Rivers; Water supply; Watersheds; Gas emissions; fertilizer; fresh water; pesticide; anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; comparative study; ecological impact; emission inventory; extinction; fish; freshwater ecosystem; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; nature-society relations; residence time; river basin; species richness; water use; article; environmental impact assessment; fish; fluid intake; freshwater environment; freshwater fish; freshwater species; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; human; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; pollutant; species extinction; species richness; ultraviolet radiation; Animals; Drinking; Environmental Monitoring; Extinction, Biological; Fishes; Fresh Water; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Rivers",,,,,,"(2006) ISO 14040.
