The maximal net photosynthetic rate (Amax), apparent quantum efficiency(φ), maximal carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and water use efficiency (WUE) of the two species were calculated based on the curves. The results showed that Amax of J. regia reached its maximum at the late-season, while the highest values of Amax of Z. jujuba occurred at the mid-season. The Amax of J. regia was more affected by relative humidity (RH) of the atmosphere, while that of Z. jujuba was more affected by the air temperature. Light saturation point (LSP) and Light compensation point (LCP) of J. regia had a higher correlation with RH of the atmosphere, those of Z. jujuba, however, had a higher correlation with air temperature. Vcmax of both J. regia and Z. jujuba had negative correlation with RH of the atmosphere. WUE of J. regia would decrease with the rise of the air temperature while that of Z. jujuba increased. Thus it could be seen that RH, temperature and soil moisture had main effect on photosynthesis and WUE of J. regia and Z. jujuba. Incorporating data on the physiological differences among tree species into forest carbon models will greatly improve our ability to predict alterations to the forest carbon budgets under various environmental scenarios such as global climate change, or with differing species composition. © 2008 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Apparent quantum efficiency (φ); Maximal carboxylation rate (Vcmax); Net photosynthetic rate (Pn); Returning cropland to forest or grassland; Seasonal variation; Water use efficiency (WUE)","carbon dioxide; water; air temperature; environmental factor; photosynthesis; plant; relative humidity; seasonal variation; soil moisture; water use efficiency; article; environment; evapotranspiration; jujube; light; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; radiation exposure; regression analysis; season; walnut; Carbon Dioxide; Environment; Juglans; Light; Photosynthesis; Plant Transpiration; Regression Analysis; Seasons; Water; Ziziphus; Juglans; Juglans regia; Ziziphus; Ziziphus jujuba",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Bassman, J.B., Zwier, J.C., Gas exchange characteristics of Populus trichocarpa, Populus deltoides and Populus trichocarpa × P. deltoids clone (1991) Tree Physiol., 8, pp. 145-149; Bassow, S.L., Canopy Photosynthesis in a Deciduous Forest: Implications of Shifts in Species Composition and Rising Concentrations of CO2 (1995), Dissertation.
