These percentages are likely to grow as ICTs become more widely available. At the same time, ICTs can be a major linchpin in efforts to combat climate change and serve as a potent cross-cutting tool to limit and ultimately reduce GHG emissions across economic and social sectors. This article looks at the potential role ICTs play at different stages, from contributing to global warming to monitoring it, to developing long-term solutions to mitigate its effects, both directly in the ICT sector and in other sectors such as energy, transport, buildings, and finally to helping adapt to its effects. The article addresses the efforts made by the ITU and its membership to develop new climate-friendly technologies. © 2008 IEEE.","Carbon dioxide; Communications technology; Computers; Global warming; Meteorology; Monitoring; Standards","Carbon dioxide; Climate control; Climatology; Cutting tools; Earth sciences; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Communications technology; Economic; Ghg emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Ict sectors; Social sectors; Climate change",,,,,,"ICTs and Climate Change (2007), http://www.itu.int/oth/T2301000003/en, Technology Watch Briefing Report #3, DecClimate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.
