Its global warming potential(GWP) for a time horizon of 100years is 25, which makes it an attractive target for climate mitigation policies. Although the methane GWP traditionally includes the methane indirect effects on the concentrations of ozone and stratospheric water vapour, it does not take into account the production of carbon dioxide from methane oxidation. We argue here that this CO2-induced effect should be included for fossil sources of methane, which results in slightly larger GWP values for all time horizons. If the global temperature change potential is used as an alternative climate metric, then the impact of the CO2-induced effect is proportionally much larger. We also discuss what the correction term should be for methane from anthropogenic biogenic sources. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; Climate metric; GTP; GWP; Indirect effect; Methane","Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Climate metric; Climate mitigations; Global temperature change; Global warming potential; GTP; GWP; Indirect effects; Methane oxidation; Methane",,,,,,"Boucher, O., Reddy, M.S., Climate trade-off between black carbon and carbon dioxide emissions (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (1), pp. 193-200; Collins, W.J., Sanderson, M.G., Johnson, C.E., Impact of increasing ship emissions on air quality and deposition over Europe by 2030 (2009) Meteorol.
