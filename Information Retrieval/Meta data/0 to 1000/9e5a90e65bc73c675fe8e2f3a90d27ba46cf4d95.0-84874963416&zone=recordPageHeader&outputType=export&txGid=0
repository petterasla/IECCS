New limits on the timing of collision and the organic carbon content of Himalayan sedimentary sources and sinks allow us to estimate the net Paleogene flux. The calculations suggest that continental collisions play a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle and climate through the exhumation as well as burial of organic carbon. -Authors",,"carbon; continental collision; exhumation; global warming; oxidation; Palaeogene",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00917613,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874963416
