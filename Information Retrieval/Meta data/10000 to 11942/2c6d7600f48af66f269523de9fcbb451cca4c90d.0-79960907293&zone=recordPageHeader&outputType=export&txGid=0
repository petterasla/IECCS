In some cases their arrival times are later by more than 1. month. This result is perplexing as spring activities of plants and animals are generally getting earlier due to warming temperatures. The first arrival dates of swallows are not related to temperature, suggesting that another factor is involved. On the basis of a questionnaire, a large majority of long-term observers are confident that there has been a moderate to severe decline in swallow populations at their field site over the study period. The greatest delays in arrival times are associated with sites with more severe reported declines in population size. Simulations using trapping data of large migratory bird populations from the United States, consisting of hundreds of individuals, suggest that severe population declines of 99% can result in delays of 10-12. days in arrival times. In summary, our results suggest that the large delays in arrival time of Korean swallows are due, at least in part, to severe reductions of more than 99% in what were formerly very large populations. Significant delays in spring phenology over time during a period of climatic warming may indicate population decline, though alternative explanations, such as changes in range or migration path or changing number of broods per season, should also be investigated. Delays in first arrival data can provide a valuable new tool to conservation biologists by indicating declines in a population that would otherwise go unnoticed. This can, in turn, lead to efforts by researchers to verify the dynamics of a population and draw attention to the conservation needs of the species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Barn swallows; Climate change; Phenology; South Korea","arrival date; climate change; conservation status; migration route; migratory species; phenology; population decline; population size; questionnaire survey; songbird; species conservation; temperature effect; trapping; South Korea; Animalia; Aves; Hirundinidae; Hirundo; Hirundo rustica",,,,,,"Amano, T., Smithers, R.J., Sparks, T.H., Sutherland, W.J., A 250-year index of first flowering dates and its response to temperature changes (2010) Proceedings of the Royal Society B - Biological Sciences, 277, pp. 2451-2457; Balbontin, J., Møller, A.P., Hermosell, I.G., Marzal, A., Reviriego, M., de Lope, F., Individual responses in spring arrival date to ecological conditions during winter and migration in a migratory bird (2009) Journal of Animal Ecology, 78, pp. 981-989; Both, C., Van Turnhout, C.A.M., Bijlsma, R.G., Siepel, H., Van Strien, A.J., Foppen, R.P.B., Avian population consequences of climate change are most severe for long-distance migrants in seasonal habitats (2010) Proceedings of the Royal Society B - Biological Sciences, 277, pp. 1259-1266; Cleland, E.E., Chuine, I., Menzel, A., Mooney, H.A., Schwartz, M.D., Shifting plant phenology in response to global change (2007) Trends Ecology and Evolution, 22, pp. 357-365; Cotton, P.A., Avian migration phenology and global climate change (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100, pp. 12219-12222; Diamond, S., Frame, A., Martin, R., Buckley, L., Species' traits predict phenological responses to climate change in butterflies (2011) Ecology; Doi, H., Delayed phenological timing of dragonfly emergence in Japan over five decades (2008) Biology Letters, 4, pp. 388-391; Gordo, O., Sanz, J.J., Impact of climate change on plant phenology in Mediterranean ecosystems (2010) Global Change Biology, 16, pp. 1082-1106; Gordo, O., Brotons, L., Ferrer, X., Comas, P., Do changes in climate patterns in wintering areas affect the timing of the spring arrival of trans-Saharan migrant birds?
