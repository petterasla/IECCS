The selection of the stations is based on hilly areas that are totally dependant on rains. This study is divided into three parts Pre-Monsoon (April- May), Summer Monsoon (June- August) and Post Monsoon (September- October). Variation trends are analyzed based on the processed data that temperature is increasing during Pre and Post Monsoon while rainfall has over all decreasing trend during the study period. Pakistan needs better prediction of Monsoon, accurate calculation of water storage and losses, particularly for the agriculture use.","Monsoon variability; Pakistan; Prediction; Rainfall; Temperature",,,,,,,"Afzaal, M., Hussain, A., Numerical Simulation of Summer Monsoon Precipitation of 1992 over Pakistan (2006) Pakistan Journal Meteorology, 3, pp. 57-677; (2005) Climatic Normal (1971-2000) of Pakistan, , Anonymous, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Karachi; (1995) Climatic Normal (1961-90) of Pakistan, , Anonymous, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Karachi; Barros, A.P., Lang, T.J., Monitoring the monsoon in the Himalayas: Observations in central Nepal, June 2001, 1999 and 2000 monsoons in Central Nepal (2003) Monthly Weather Review, 131, p. 1408; Chaudhry, Q.Z., (1992) Analysis and Seasonal prediction of Pakistan Summer Monsoon Rainfall, , Ph.D. Thesis, Univ, of Philippines, Quezon City, Philippines; Chung, C., Nigam, S., Asian summer monsoon-ENSO feedback on the Cane-Zebiak model ENSO (1999) J. of Climate, 12, pp. 2787-28077; Dimri, A.P., Surface and Upper air fields during extreme winter precipitation over the western Himalayas (2006) Pure and Applied Geophysics, 163, pp. 1679-1698; Dimri, A.P., A study of mean winter circulation characteristics and energetic over Southeastern Asia (2007) Pure and Applied Geophysics, 164, pp. 1081-1106; Ding, Y., The Variability of Asian Summer Monsoon (2007) J.
