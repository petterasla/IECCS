The reliability of lichens as biomonitors, particularly in respect of air pollution, is explored. The importance of baseline data and the value of adopting rigorous protocols for data retrieval are stressed. This is exemplified by personal experience in monitoring radionuclides in Poland before and after the Chernobyl disaster: the genera Umbilicaria and Lasallia proved ideal for this work, the signatures (ratios) of the different radionuclides taken up by the thalli providing consistent values and reliable baseline data. The role of lichens in environmental impact assessment (EIA) of both quantitative and qualitative changes in air pollution burdens and of a wide range of natural and man-made perturbations, even at a global level, is demonstrated. Lichens, due to their sensitivity, can be used as an early warning system for other biota that, without remedial action, may subsequently suffer stress or indeed extinction through environmental mismanagement. Information gained from our knowledge of how lichens respond to long-term perturbations and short-term upheavals in nature can be applied to the interpretation and monitoring of environmental changes and disasters brought about by a wide range of human activities.","Air pollution; Biomonitors; Chernobyl; Environmental impact assessment; Global warming; Lichens; Radionuclides","atmospheric pollution; bioindicator; Chernobyl accident; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; lichen; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Poland; cellular organisms; Lasallia; Umbilicaria",,,,,,"Bargagli, R., Nimis, P.L., Guidelines for the use of epiphytic lichens as biomonitors of atmospheric deposition of trace elements (2002) Monitoring with Lichens - Monitoring Lichen, pp. 295-304. , P.L.
