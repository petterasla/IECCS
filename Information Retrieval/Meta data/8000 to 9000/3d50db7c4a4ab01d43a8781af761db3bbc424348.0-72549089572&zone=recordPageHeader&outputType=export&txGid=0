This paper analyses and compares the four main types of GHG accounting in waste management including their special features and approaches: the national accounting, with reference to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the corporate level, as part of the annual reporting on environmental issues and social responsibility, life-cycle assessment (LCA), as an environmental basis for assessing waste management systems and technologies, and finally, the carbon trading methodology, and more specifically, the clean development mechanism (CDM) methodology, introduced to support cost-effective reduction in GHG emissions. These types of GHG accounting, in principle, have a common starting point in technical data on GHG emissions from specific waste technologies and plants, but the limited availability of data and, moreover, the different scopes of the accounting lead to many ways of quantifying emissions and producing the accounts. The importance of transparency in GHG accounting is emphasised regarding waste type, waste composition, time period considered, GHGs included, global warming potential (GWP) assigned to the GHGs, counting of biogenic carbon dioxide, choice of system boundaries, interactions with the energy system, and generic emissions factors. In order to enhance transparency and consistency, a format called the upstream-operating-downstream framework (UOD) is proposed for reporting basic technology-related data regarding GHG issues including a clear distinction between direct emissions from waste management technologies, indirect upstream (use of energy and materials) and indirect downstream (production of energy, delivery of secondary materials) activities.","Clean development mechanism; Greenhouse gas accounting; IPCC and corporate accounts; Life-cycle assessment; Waste management","Accounting IS; Carbon trading; Clean development mechanism; Corporate level; Direct emissions; Emissions factors; Energy systems; Environmental issues; GHG emission; Global warming potential; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; IPCC and corporate accounts; Life-cycle assessments; National accounting; Secondary materials; Social responsibilities; Support costs; System boundary; Technical data; Time periods; Waste composition; Waste management systems; Carbon dioxide; Cost accounting; Emission control; Energy conversion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Technology; Transparency; Waste management; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; clean development mechanism; climate change; emissions trading; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; waste management; waste technology; accounting; air pollution control; clean development mechanism methodology; cost effectiveness analysis; energy consumption; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; global warming potential; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; life cycle assessment; organization; priority journal; process technology; review; upstream operating downstream framework; waste management; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Sulfur Hexafluoride; Time Factors; Waste Management",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Chlorofluorocarbons; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Sulfur Hexafluoride, 2551-62-4",,,,"Astrup, T., Møller, J., Fruergaard, T., (2009) Incineration and co-combustion of waste: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 789-799; Bogner, J., Abdelrafie Ahmed, M., Diaz, C., Faaij, A., Gao, Q., Hashimoto, S., Mareckova, K., Zhang, T., Waste management (2007) Climate Change 2007.
