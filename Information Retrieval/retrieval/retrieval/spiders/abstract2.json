What can be the best use of AOGCMs for assessing the climate change in a particular region? The question is complicated by the consideration of intra-year month-to-month variability of a particular climate variable such as precipitation or temperature in a specific region. A maximum entropy method (MEM), which combines limited information with empirical perspectives, is applied to assessing the probability-weighted multimodel ensemble average of a climate variable at the region scale. The method is compared to and coupled with other two methods: the root mean square error minimization method and the simple multimodel ensemble average method. A mechanism is developed to handle a comprehensive range of model uncertainties and to identify the best combination of AOGCMs based on a balance of two rules: depending equally on all models versus giving higher priority to models more strongly verified by the historical observation. As a case study, the method is applied to a central US region to compute the probability-based average changes in monthly precipitation and temperature projected for 2055, based on outputs from a set of AOGCMs. Using the AOGCM data prepared by international climate change study groups and local climate observation data, one can apply the MEM to precipitation or temperature for a particular region to generate an annual cycle, which includes the effects from both global climate change and local intra-year climate variability. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V."], "title": "A maximum entropy method for combining AOGCMs for regional intra-year climate change assessment"},

Unregulated rivers in the Ross catchment basin deliver freshwater flows to their estuaries during both strong and weak wet seasons. The construction of a series of dams and weirs on Ross River means the wet-dry cycle is accentuated, leading to constant marine salinities throughout the estuary becoming the norm, with a lack of freshwater flow for five or more years at a time. The fish fauna of Ross River estuary was sampled in the post wet and dry seasons during an extremely dry climatic period (1994) and extremely wet climatic period (2000) using a small mesh (6 mm) pocket seine net. The fish fauna seemed to reflect seasonal differences. Catches from 1994 (dry period) were comprised entirely of 88 marine and euryhaline species, while the 69 species captured in 2000 (wet period) included 13 freshwater species. However, the freshwater species in the upper estuary were individuals washed over the weir, rather than part of a functional faunal gradient. During 1994 faunal composition was related more to site identity than to the position of the site along an upstream gradient. In contrast, during 2000 there were clear upstream faunal gradients with compositions in upstream sites heavily influenced by freshwater species, and marine and euryhaline species dominating downstream sites. Patterns of species dominance also varied between years. In contrast, trophic composition showed consistent shifts in both years, from high proportions of herbivores, carnivores and benthoplanktivores in May towards high proportions of benthivores in August. Not only do faunal composition, seasonal faunal change and ecological connectivity seem to be impaired, but ecological processes in the estuary that rely on seasonal freshwater flows are likely to be unable to operate normally in most years.

Toward this end research was conducted on developing methods for the retrieval of spatially and temporally varying patterns of soil moisture from recently burned boreal forest ecosystems of Alaska using C-band satellite radar data. To do this we focused on both individual date and temporal SAR datasets to develop techniques and algorithms which indicate how moisture varies across a recently burned boreal forest. For each of the methods developed we focused on reducing errors of SAR-derived soil moisture estimates due to confounding factors of variations in vegetative biomass and surface roughness. For the individual date soil moisture monitoring, we grouped test sites by a measurable biophysical variable, burn severity, and then developed algorithms relating moisture to SAR backscatter for each burn severity group. The algorithms developed had high coefficients of determination (0.56-0.82) and the moisture maps produced had high accuracy (3.61 rms error) based on the minimal validation conducted. For the seasonal soil moisture mapping we used principal component analysis to capture the time-variant feature of soil moisture and minimize the relatively time-invariant features that confound SAR backscatter.

Yet, after the introduction of management measures, the seagrass bed seemed to recover. Consequently, the biomass and production also increased substantially, for the whole intertidal area. Nevertheless, even after the mitigation measures implementation, natural-induced stressors, such as strong flood events induced a drastic reduction of annual production, not seen before the implementation of those measures.

The evaluation was based on measures of (1) spatial changes in the physico-chemical properties that are commonly used to classify stream types for ecological purposes and (2) variation in periphyton (predominantly diatom and macroalgal) communities. Stream water and algae were sampled along longitudinal and lateral transects of the stream. The results showed that groundwater discharge increased stream flow, electrical conductivity, pH, nitrate concentrations, and turbidity, and lowered temperature. This caused variation in stream physico-chemical properties along the stream reach and laterally across the mixing area. The influence of the groundwater discharge was reflected in a change in the stream's ecological classification from nivo-krenal (i.e. snowmelt-groundwater mix) to krenal (i.e. groundwater dominated). The discharge of groundwater to the stream was also associated with changes in the algal community both downstream (reach-scale) and across the mixing area (sub-reach-scale), as indicated by differences in relative abundance of dominant diatom taxa and macroalgae, including a proliferation of the chrysophycean alga Hydrurus.

Return periods for threshold exceedence is modelled statistically, and the climate change data from the UKCIP 2002 report (Hulme et al. 2002) is applied to this model. For the predicted changes in precipitation, it is shown that the instability threshold could decrease from 4 to 3.5 years by the 2080s for the medium-high climate change scenario. However, predicted temperature changes could influence the response of the landslide through increased evapotranspiration leading to a change in the triggering precipitation thresholds, and this will help counter the impact of changes in precipitation. Analysis of sources of uncertainty in the model has been used to establish the factors that contribute to the predicted changes in stability.

An accurate estimation of biogenic emissions of VOC (volatile organic compounds) is necessary for better understanding a series of current environmental problems such as summertime smog and global climate change. However, very limited studies have been reported on such emissions in China. The aim of this paper is to present an estimate of biogenic VOC emissions during summertime in China, and discuss its uncertainties and potential areas for further investigations. Materials and Methods. This study was mainly based on field data and related research available so far in China and abroad, including distributions of land use and vegetations, biomass densities and emission potentials. VOC were grouped into isoprene, monoterpenes and other VOC (OVOC). Emission potentials of forests were determined for 22 genera or species, and then assigned to 33 forest ecosystems. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis database was used as standard environmental conditions. A typical summertime of July 1999 was chosen for detailed calculations. Results and Discussion. The biogenic VOC emissions in China in July were estimated to be 2.3\u00d710", "gC, with 42% as isoprene, 19% as monoterpenes and 39% as OVOC. About 77.3% of the emissions are generated from forests and woodlands. The averaged emission intensity was 4.11 mgC m", " hr", " for forests and 1.12 mgC m", " hr", " for all types of vegetations in China during the summertime. The uncertainty in the results arose from both the data and the assumptions used in the extrapolations. Generally, uncertainty in the field measurements is relatively small. A large part of the uncertainty mainly comes from the taxonomic method to assign emission potentials to unmeasured species, while the ARGR method serves to estimate leaf biomass and the emission algorithms to describe light and temperature dependence. Conclusions. This study describes a picture of the biogenic VOC emissions during summertime in China. Due to the uneven spatial and temporal distributions, biogenic VOC emissions may play an important role in the tropospheric chemistry during summertime. Recommendations and Perspectives. Further investigations are needed to reduce uncertainties involved in the related factors such as emission potentials, leaf biomass, species distribution as well as the mechanisms of the emission activities. Besides ground measurements, attention should also be placed on other techniques such as remote-sensing and dynamic modeling. These new approaches, combined with ground measurements as basic database for calibration and evaluation, can hopefully provide more comprehensive information in the research of this field. \u00a9 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe H\u00fcthig Jehle Rehm GmbH)."], "title": "An estimate of biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds during summertime in China"},

This long term pattern culminated in the survival of a single extant species, Aplodontia rufa, the mountain beaver. The species' richness and body size distribution through time were compared with the timing of climatic changes as inferred from global oxygen isotope curves, with the rise of grasslands as inferred from phytolith and other stable isotope studies, and with fluctuating diversity of potential competitors as inferred from published stratigraphic and geographic distributions. The timing of global climate change is decoupled from the diversity fluctuations and seems not to have been a proximate cause. Rise of grasslands and the increasing dominance of C", " vegetation correlates with diversity decline in the late Oligocene and late Miocene, but data are sparse, and more work will be required to determine the mechanism driving this relationship. Examination of potential mammalian competitors (sciurids and castorids) finds no evidence for competitive replacement of aplodontids. It is difficult to ascribe the fluctuations in aplodontid diversity to a single cause.

This paper presents the first results of a project involving four laboratories developing and combining specific methods to extract information from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Two different information sources are processed, namely: 1) airborne photography and 2) spaceborne C-band SAR interferometry. The difficulties and limitations of their processing in the context of Alpine glaciers are discussed and illustrated on two glaciers located in the Mont-Blanc area. The results obtained by aerial triangulation techniques provide digital terrain models with an accuracy that is better than 30 cm, which is compatible with the computation of volume balance and useful for precise georeferencing and slope measurement updating. The results obtained by SAR differential interferometry using European Remote Sensing Satellite images show that it is possible to measure temperate glacier surface velocity fields from October to April in one-day interferograms with approximately 20-m ground sampling.

A serious issue pertaining to this is the dual nature of damage triggered by events combined with climate change and natural hazards. For example, catastrophic damage could result from the combination of global warming with a great earthquake, which is a worst-case scenario. Although this worst-case scenario has rarely occurred and presents a low probability of occurrence, countermeasures must be prepared in advance based on an appropriate response and adaptation strategies. After an overview of possible infrastructural instabilities caused by global warming, methodologies are proposed placing emphasis on the increasing probability of infrastructural instability triggered by natural hazards resulting from groundwater-level (GWL) variations. These effects are expected to be particularly serious in coastal regions because of the influence of the rising sea level resulting from global warming. The influence of sea-level rises (SLR) will become apparent along with land subsidence because groundwater abstraction will become severe in coastal regions. Additionally, the probability of earthquake liquefaction increases if GWL rises in accompaniment with SLR. Using case histories, we examined the possible occurrence of these natural hazards as a result of global warming. Finally, possible countermeasures and adaptation strategies for reducing and mitigating infrastructure damage accelerated by global warming are described for each case in specific regions.

By using global climate change scenarios as driving fields, one can obtain permafrost dynamics in high temporal resolution on the order of years. For the 21st century under the IPCC SRES scenarios A2 and B2, we find an increase of mean annual ground temperature by up to 6\u00a0K and of active layer depth by up to 2\u00a0m within the East Siberian transect. According to these simulations, a significant part of the transect will suffer from permafrost degradation by the end of the century. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Strong seasonal differences in both tested parameters occurred under natural conditions (no resource addition), and the effects of temperature increase at a given time were relatively low. However, increasing temperature can significantly accelerate the colonization speed and reduce the carrying capacity in particular seasons. These effects were strongest in winter. Simultaneous manipulation of temperature and of resource availability amplified the response to temperature increase, adumbrating strong interactive control of populations by temperature and resource availability.

This study attempts to explore an inverse approach to the modelling of hydrologic risk and vulnerability to changing climatic conditions.

A hydrologic model is used to transform inversely the main hydrologic exposures, such as floods and droughts, into corresponding meteorological conditions. The frequency of critical meteorological situations is investigated under present and future climatic scenarios by means of a generic weather generator. The weather generator, linked with GCMs at the last step of the proposed methodology, allows the creation of an ensemble of different scenarios, as well as an easy updating, when new and improved GCM outputs become available.

During the last glaciation, the buildup and southerly expansion of large continental ice-sheets in the Northern Hemisphere and extensive cover of sea ice in the N. Pacific and the N. Atlantic imposed a much more zonal climatic circulation system than exists today. We hypothesize that this, in combination with the frigid (dry) polar air led to a significant decrease in freshwater runoff into the Arctic Ocean. In addition the freshwater contribution of the fresher Pacific water was completely eliminated by the emergence of the Bering Strait (sill depth 50 m). As the Arctic freshwater input was depleted, regions of the Arctic Ocean lost surface stability and eventually overturned, bringing warmer deep water to the surface where it melted the overlying sea ice. This upwelled water was quickly cooled and sank as newly formed deep water. For sustained overturn events, such as might have occurred during the peak of very large glacial periods (i.e. the last glacial maximum), the voluminous deep water formed would eventually overflow into the Nordic Seas and North Atlantic necessitating an equally voluminous rate of return flow of warmer surface waters from the North Atlantic thus breaking down the Arctic's zonal isolation, melting the expansive NA sea ice cover and initiating oceanic heating of the atmosphere over the ice-sheets bordering the NA. We suggest that the combined effect of these overturn-induced events in concert with a Milankovitch warming cycle, was sufficient to drive the system to a termination. We elaborate on this proposed sequence of events, using the model for the formation of the Weddell Sea polynya as proposed by Martinson et al.

Ancestral (predrought) genotypes were recovered from stored seed and raised under a set of common environments with descendant (postdrought) genotypes and with ancestor x descendant hybrids. As predicted, the abbreviated growing seasons caused by drought led to the evolution of earlier onset of flowering. Descendants bloomed earlier than ancestors, advancing first flowering by 1.9 days in one study population and 8.6 days in another. The intermediate flowering time of ancestor x descendant hybrids supports an additive genetic basis for divergence. Experiments confirmed that summer drought selected for early flowering, that flowering time was heritable, and that selection intensities in the field were more than sufficient to account for the observed evolutionary change. Natural selection for drought escape thus appears to have caused adaptive evolution in just a few generations.

However, projections of future changes should be based on robust information on the ecological niche of species. This paper presents a macroecological study of the environmental tolerance and ecological niche (sensu Hutchinson 1957, i.e. the field of tolerance of a species to the principal factors of its environment) of Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus in the North Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. Biological data were collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey, which samples plankton in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas at a standard depth of 7 m. Eleven parameters were chosen including bathymetry, temperature, salinity, nutrients, mixed-layer depth and an index of turbulence compiled from wind data and chlorophyll a concentrations (used herein as an index of available food). The environmental window and the optimum level were determined for both species and for each abiotic factor and chlorophyll concentration. The most important parameters that influenced abundance and spatial distribution were temperature and its correlates such as oxygen and nutrients. Bathymetry and other water-column-related parameters also played an important role. The ecological niche of C. finmarchicus was larger than that of C. helgolandicus and both niches were significantly separated. Our results have important implications in the context of global climate change. As temperature (and to some extent stratification) is predicted to continue to rise in the North Atlantic sector, changes in the spatial distribution of these 2 Calanus species can be expected. Application of this approach to the 1980s North Sea regime shift provides evidence that changes in sea temperature alone could have triggered the substantial and rapid changes identified in the dynamic regimes of these ecosystems. C. finmarchicus appears to be a good indicator of the Atlantic Polar Biome (mainly the Atlantic Subarctic and Arctic provinces) while C. helgolandicus is an indicator of more temperate waters (Atlantic Westerly Winds Biome) in regions characterised by more pronounced spatial changes in bathymetry. \u00a9 Inter-Research 2007."], "title": "Macroecology of Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus in the North Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas"},

For tropical reef corals, the contribution of juveniles to population dynamics is strongly determined by their growth rates, which are inversely proportional to the duration of this life stage and the risks of mortality, yet empirical estimates of this important trait are surprisingly rare. Based largely on results published before 1990, it is often assumed that juvenile corals \u226450 mm diameter grow \u223c10 to 34 mm yr", ", and therefore are \u223c1.5 to 5.0 yr old. In contrast, results presented here show that juvenile corals (\u226440 mm diameter) in St. John, US Virgin Islands, have grown at much slower rates on shallow reefs (<9 m depth) where annual censuses have been completed for 9 yr (1996 to 2005). For nearly a decade, juvenile corals in this location have maintained overall mean growth rates of only 3 mm yr", ", or 6 mm yr", " for the subset of colonies that grew \u2265 0 mm yr", ". Therefore, most of these juvenile corals have grown at rates consistent with an upper age estimate of 7 to 13 yr, which is 1.4 to 8.7 times older than estimates derived from often-cited growth rates. This discrepancy has important implications, because it suggests that the recruitment dynamics of coral populations may function over time scales longer than are usually considered. Conceivably, these time scales may now extend over lengthier periods than once was the case, at least as can be determined from sparse results distributed through > 32 yr of peer-reviewed studies that reveal a gradual decline in the growth rates of juvenile corals. The correspondence of this decline with rising seawater temperature and depressed aragonite saturation state raises the possibility that the effects of global climate change have already reduced the growth of juvenile corals. \u00a9 Inter-Research 2007."], "title": "Evidence for a decadal-scale decline in the growth rates of juvenile scleractinian corals"},

A shortage of long-term data linking climatic variation, oceanography and tropical seabird reproductive biology at both within- and between-season temporal scales means that the potential impact of climate change on these species is largely unknown. The sooty tern Sterna fuscata, an almost ubiquitous tropical seabird, has been declining on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, over the last 3 decades. We examined the relationship between sooty tern foraging success and sea-surface temperature (SST) at Michaelmas Cay over 2 consecutive breeding seasons. Consistent patterns were observed with significant negative relationships between day-to-day variation in SST and both the amount of food fed to chicks and the feeding frequency during the latter two-thirds of each breeding season. At the beginning of each breeding cycle, rapid changes in foraging success highlighted that other within-season mechanisms also influence sooty tern reproductive potential. Our results suggest a previously undescribed spatial and temporal link between SST and sooty tern reproduction. Combined with previous findings for the southern GBR, this suggests that SST variation can influence the foraging success of multiple tropical seabird species at a reef-wide scale and implies a significant negative effect of forecasted climatic changes on seabirds breeding on the GBR. \u00a9 Inter-Research 2007."], "title": "Day-to-day variation in sea-surface temperature reduces sooty tern Sterna fuscata foraging success on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia"},

During the next 2 decades the rangelands will be buffeted by many of the same old issues and well as obvious emerging ones. Important human-centric ones will be the tension between European and Aboriginal demographic trends, the increased economic dominance of mining, tourism and defence in the rangelands, and the ?sponge effect' of successful towns and particular enterprises. Ecological and bio-physical issues will include carbon trading, energy generation, water catchments, weeds and diseases and agricultural incursions into the northern rangelands. The broad directions of ?looking out' and ?looking in' still retain some currency for today's rangeland decision makers but are now embedded in far stronger and shifting currents that are frequently determined by global and national dynamics, rather than local issues.

Streamflow data from 10 gauging stations downstream of major dams were divided into hydrologic series corresponding to the periods before and after dam construction. Pre- and post-dam flows were compared with respect to hydrograph characteristics representing frequency, magnitude and shape: annual flood peak, annual flow trough, annual flood volume, time to flood peak, flood drawdown time and interarrival time. The use of such a suite of characteristics within a statistical and graphical framework allows for generalising distinct strategies of flood control operation that can be identified without any a priori knowledge of operations rules. Dam operation is highly dependent on the ratio of reservoir capacity to annual flood volume (impounded runoff index). Dams with high values of this index generally completely cut off flood peaks thus reducing time to peak, drawdown time and annual flood volume. Those with low values conduct early and late flow releases to extend the hydrograph, increasing time to peak, drawdown time and annual flood volume. The analyses reveal minimal flood control benefits from foothill dams in the lower Sacramento River (i.e. dissipation of the down-valley flood control signal). The lower part of the basin is instead reliant on a weir and bypass system to control lowland flooding.

As there are only 55 years of observations on ocean heat content, the Kalman filter is used to estimate heat content as a latent state variable, which is constrained by the available observations. This method could be applied to other climate change problems where there are only limited observations on key variables. The final model adopted relates surface temperature to the heat content of the upper 300 m of the ocean. The resulting parameter estimates are closer to theoretically expected values than those of previous time series models and the estimated climate sensitivity to a doubling of carbon dioxide is 4.4 K. \u00a9 2005."], "title": "An atmosphere-ocean time series model of global climate change"},

The adoption of carbon/pollution taxes both internationally and regionally has been fueled by global climate change and fuel security risks, with a significant portion of such policy interventions directed at the electric power industry. The general framework that we develop allows for three distinct types of carbon taxation environmental policies, beginning with a completely decentralized scheme in which taxes can be applied to each individual power generator/power plant in order to guarantee that each assigned emission bound is not exceeded, to two versions of a centralized scheme, one which assumes a fixed bound over the entire electric power supply chain in terms of total carbon emissions and the other which allows the bound to be a function of the tax. The behavior of the various decision-makers in the electric power supply chain network is described, along with the three taxation schemes, and the governing equilibrium conditions, which are formulated as finite-dimensional variational inequality problems. Twelve numerical examples are presented in which the optimal carbon taxes, as well as the equilibrium electric power flows and demands, are computed. The numerical results demonstrate, as the theory predicts, that the carbon taxes achieve the desired goal, in that the imposed bounds on the carbon emissions are not exceeded. Moreover, they illustrate the spectrum of scenarios that can be explored in terms of changes in the bounds on the carbon emissions; changes in emission factors; changes in the demand price functions, etc. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Differing tectonic models for the behaviour of the lithosphere during continental collision have contrasting implications for the elevation of the plateau.

To test this hypothesis fungal abundance was quantified in the early wet, late wet, early dry and late dry seasons within known bettong habitat. A relationship was found between precipitation and fungal availability, with the abundance of hypogeous fungi being significantly lower in the late dry season. Fungal availability correlated strongly with the seasonal rainfall pattern determined from 74-year monthly means. This contrasts with a previous study where mycophagy, measured by faecal analysis, remained high across seasons presumably because of aseasonal rainfall during that study period. Alloteropsis semialata R.Br. (cockatoo grass) use by bettongs increased significantly during the period of low fungal availability. This suggests that the importance of cockatoo grass as an alternative food resource during annual and extended dry periods has previously been underestimated. With the frequency and intensity of drought expected to increase with global climate change, these findings have significant implications for bettong management.

American Journal of Science, 277, 178-191.]. These are complemented by effects of alterations of land use, such as deforestation, intensive agriculture and incidence of fire, with the most extreme effects produced by building activity and urbanisation. Changing river channels are most evident in the channel cross-section where changes of size, shape and composition are now well-established, with up to tenfold increases or decreases illustrated by results from more than 200 world studies. In addition the overall channel planform, the network and the ecology have changed. Specific terms have become associated with changing river channels including enlargement, shrinkage and metamorphosis. Although the scope of adjustment has been established, it has not always been possible to predict what will happen in a particular location, because of complex response and contingency. The ways in which changes in cross-section relate to reach and network changes are less clear, despite investigations showing the distribution of changes along segmented channels. When considering the human role in relation to changing river channels, at least five challenges persist. First, because prediction of the nature and amount of likely change at a particular location is not certain, and because the contrasting responses of humid and arid systems needs to be considered, modelling is required to reduce uncertainty, as was first emphasised by Burkham [Burkham, D.E., 1981. Uncertainties resulting from changes in river form. American Society Civil Engineers Proceedings, Journal Hydraulics Division 107, 593-610.]. Second, feedback effects incorporated within the relationship between changes at channel, reach and network scales can have considerable implications, especially because changes now evident may have occurred, or have been initiated, under different environmental conditions. Third, consideration of global climate change is imperative when considering channel sensitivity and responses to threshold conditions. Fourth, channel design involving geomorphology should now be an integral part of restoration procedures. This requires, fifthly, greater awareness of different cultures as a basis for understanding constraints imposed by legislative frameworks. Better understanding of the ways in which the perception of the human role in changing river channels varies with culture as well as varying over time should enhance application of design for river channel landscapes. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Examining species climatic preferences via bioclimatic niche modelling is a key tool to study this impact. There is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and phylogenetic diversification. A next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective. We present such a study using Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae), a group which demonstrates morphological and phenological adaptations to its seasonal Mediterranean-type climate. How will the predicted climate change affect future distribution of this popular genus of garden plants? Results: We demonstrate phylogenetic structure for some climatic characteristics, and show that most Cyclamen have distinct climatic niches, with the exception of several wide-ranging, geographically expansive, species. We reconstruct climate preferences for hypothetical ancestral Cyclamen. The ancestral Cyclamen lineage has a preference for the seasonal Mediterranean climate characteristic of dry summers and wet winters. Future bioclimatic niches, based on BIOCLIM and Maxent models, are examined with reference to a future climate scenario for the 2050s. Over the next 50 years we predict a northward shift in the area of climatic suitability, with many areas of current distribution becoming climatically unsuitable. The area of climatic suitability for every Cyclamen species is predicted to decrease. For many species, there may be no areas with a suitable climate regardless of dispersal ability, these species are considered to be at high risk of extinction. This risk is examined from a phylogenetic perspective. Conclusion: Examining bioclimatic niches from a phylogenetic perspective permits novel interpretations of these models. In particular, reconstruction of ancestral niches can provide testable hypothesis about the historical development of lineages. In the future we can expect a northwards shift in climatic suitability for the genus Cyclamen. If this proves to be the case then dispersal is the best chance of survival, which seems highly unlikely for ant-dispersed Cyclamen. Human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges offers hope and could provide the only means of dispersal to potentially suitable future environments. Even without human intervention the phylogenetic perspective demonstrates that major lineages could survive climate change even if many species are lost. \u00a9 2006 Yesson and Culham; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."], "title": "A phyloclimatic study of Cyclamen"},

The basis for this is the fact that we are already facing climate changes that will become even more significant in the future. The impact of climate changes is and will be noticeable in all fields of human activity; therefore, it will also influence the supply and demand of energy. Since we are observing a longer period of time, comparable to the lifespan of a building, and the amount of energy demanded is an important factor, it is necessary to adjust the building and the renovation of buildings to the predicted climate changes. The prediction of a building's thermal response is the basis for the integral planning of the building and building services installation with which we create suitable living conditions. In order to predict the expected changes in the building's thermal response in the future it is necessary to correct the available meteorological variable databases today. In this paper we present various climate-change scenaria expected for Slovenia and the methods for correcting the starting points of the local meteorological databases. For the correction we used simplified mathematical models with which we - by forming test reference years (TRYs) - elaborate corrected test reference years (CTRYs). The latter are used for declaring the changes in energy demand in buildings and the effectiveness of a chosen building services installation that uses natural energy sources. As regards the predicted climate scenaria for the continental part of Slovenia, the energy use for heating buildings will be reduced by 1.5% to 31.4%. These climate changes will have a substantial influence on the thermal comfort in buildings during the summer. In the heavyweight and naturally ventilated residential buildings that are currently thermally comfortable, suitable summer temperatures will be exceeded during 20% to 33% of the summer. The effectiveness of natural and passive cooling techniques will radically change. In cooled buildings we can expect a 2-to-40-fold increase in the use of final (end-use) cooling energy when compared to today.

Regionally, the southwestern Okhotsk Sea is closely linked to climate change in East Asia, including Japan, because the cold sea surface temperature (SST) in the southwestern Okhotsk Sea influences directly the development of the Okhotsk atmospheric high-pressure system, and the activated Okhotsk high causes cold climatic conditions in northern Japan. Therefore, environmental change in the Okhotsk Sea indicates two-way interactions as a sensitive mirror reflecting global climate change and as a driving force of regional climate change. To better understand how surface environmental changes in the Okhotsk Sea can influence climate change in East Asia, SSTs were estimated in the southwestern Okhotsk Sea for the past 120\u00a0ky with millennial to centennial time resolution using the long-chain unsaturated alkyl ketone (alkenone) thermometer. The alkenone temperature, which corresponds to the SST to 20\u00a0m depth in autumn, showed repeated abrupt changes at a centennial timescale, especially during the last glacial period, 20-60\u00a0ky before present (BP). The alkenone temperature changed concurrently with changes from interstadials (warm events) to stadials (cold events) in the \u03b4", "O record of the ice cores from Greenland, although some interstadials could not be identified in the alkenone temperature record. A wavelet power spectrum analysis showed that a periodicity of about 8\u00a0ky was prominent during 10-90\u00a0ky BP, and a 4- to 5-ky cycle was characteristic during 30-40\u00a0ky BP in the alkenone temperature records. These periodicities were both similar and dissimilar to those in the Polar Circulation Index, which is based on the atmospheric circulation intensity at high latitudes, as recorded by major-ion concentrations in GISP2. Both the similarity and dissimilarity imply that the SST in the southwestern Okhotsk Sea is controlled mainly by the atmosphere-ocean circulation system in the Northern Hemisphere; however, the relationship between the SST in the Okhotsk Sea and the climate in the Greenland is not linear. Anomalously high alkenone temperatures occurred repeatedly in the glacial period. These warm alkenone temperature episodes would have had multiple causes. In particular, high alkenone temperatures during the last glacial maximum (LGM) have been reported previously for locations near this study site.

The development rate of insect arthropods is strongly affected by temperature, and these temperature-dependent phenological effects couple with shifts in the daily activity periods for both prey and predator, thereby increasing or decreasing opportunities for interaction. The model addresses these effects quantitatively by introducing a temperature-dependent, joint-activity factor that enters the predator's functional response.

Persistent effects of earlier nutrient loading on Calluna growth and phenology, and on the abundance of lichens, were apparent up to 8 years after nitrogen additions ceased, indicating the potential for long-term effects of modest nutrient loading (up to 15.4 kg N ha", " yr", ", over 7 years) on heathland ecosystems. The size and activity of the soil microbial community was elevated in former N-treated plots, 6-8 years after additions ceased, suggesting a prolonged effect on the rate of nutrient cycling. Although habitat management in 1998 reduced nitrogen stores in plant biomass, effects on belowground nitrogen stores were small. Although some parameters (e.g. soil pH) recover pretreatment levels relatively rapidly, others (e.g. vegetation cover and microbial activity) respond much more slowly, indicating that the ecological effects of even small increases in nitrogen deposition will persist for many years after deposition inputs are reduced. Indeed, calculations suggest that the additional soil nitrogen storage associated with 7 years of experimental nitrogen inputs could sustain the observed effects on plant growth and phenology for several decades.

Other effects, however, have arisen from alterations in disturbance regimes that maintain the structure and function of these ecosystems. How have alterations of the disturbance regime altered the physiognomy of 'old-growth' stands, and what are the implications for ecosystem conservation and restoration? Methods: In contrast to models that emphasize close interactions among the vertically complex strata, we develop a conceptual phenomenological model for the physiognomic structure of Pinus palustris stands. We relate two natural disturbances (tropical storms and fire) that affect different stages of the life cycle to different aspects of the physiognomic structure. We then compare overstorey stand structure and ground cover composition of two old-growth longleaf stands near the extremes of different composite disturbance regimes: the Wade Tract (frequent hurricanes and fire) and the Boyd Tract (infrequent hurricanes and long-term fire exclusion). Results: We predict that tropical storms and fires have different effects on stand physiognomy. Tropical storms are periodic, and sometimes intense, whereas fires are more frequent and less intense. Hurricanes directly influence the overstorey via wind-caused damage and mortality, and indirectly influence the herb layer by altering the spatial distribution of shading and litter accumulation. Fire exerts direct effects on juvenile stages and indirect effects on the herb layer via fine fuel consumption and selective mortality of potential competitors of P. palustris juveniles. These differences in effects of disturbances can result in widely different physiognomies for P. palustris stands. Finally, some global climate change scenarios have suggested that changes may occur in tropical storm and fire regimes, altering frequency and severity. Such changes may greatly affect pine stands, and ultimately entire pine savanna ecosystems. Conclusions: Our phenomenological model of disturbance regimes in Pinus palustris old-growth produces very different physiognomies for different disturbances regimes that reflect natural process and human management actions. This model can be used to derive restoration strategies for pine savannas that are linked to reinstitution of important ecological processes rather than specific physiognomic states. \u00a9 IAVS; Opulus Press."], "title": "Natural disturbances and the physiognomy of pine savannas: A phenomenological model"},

At the heart of this movement is the need to resolve conflicts between high-intensity use of low-cost fossil energy supplies, and the dominating impact of carbon dioxide emissions on global climate change. US states are among the largest carbon dioxide emitters in the world and play a critical role in supplying and transforming energy, as well as consuming it, for economic advantage. State governments are also likely to have to shoulder some of the cost of potentially extensive climate damages and bear the brunt of the cost of implementing future federal mandates. As a result, many are taking proactive stances on the development of climate mitigation policy to prepare for, accelerate, and/or guide national policy. As US states show leadership on addressing greenhouse gas emissions, they also play an important role in forging policies and measures that reduce economic conflict between energy and climate goals. A number have launched or completed greenhouse gas mitigation plans and other major policies in the past few years that address these conflicts through: (1) finding ways to reduce mitigation costs, including the use of incentive-based policy instruments; (2) promoting an open and democratic policy process that includes major stakeholders; (3) promoting equity across socioeconomic groups, regions, and generations; and (4) promoting interregional cooperation. The results are promising and suggest that the state arena for climate and energy policy is evolving quickly and constructively toward alternatives that reduce conflict. Regional efforts are also unfolding, along with greater congressional attention to the lessons learned and commitments made by sub-federal actions. In the next few years many national energy and climate conflicts are likely to be tested and addressed by states. Among these, Pennsylvania is likely to be an important player due to its high profile of energy production and potential for leadership. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Necessarily, such regions reflect the wind records in the tropics, because high productivity is associated with upwelling driven by winds.

The models were designed to simulate atmospheric and oceanic climate and variability from the diurnal time scale through multicentury climate change, given our computational constraints. In particular, an important goal was to use the same model for both experimental seasonal to interannual forecasting and the study of multicentury global climate change, and this goal has been achieved. Tw o versions of the coupled model are described, called CM2.0 and CM2.1. The versions differ primarily in the dynamical core used in the atmospheric component, along with the cloud tuning and some details of the land and ocean components. For both coupled models, the resolution of the land and atmospheric components is 2\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 longitude; the atmospheric model has 24 vertical levels. The ocean resolution is 1\u00b0 in latitude and longitude, with meridional resolution equatorward of 30\u00b0 becoming progressively finer, such that the meridional resolution is 1/3\u00b0 at the equator. There are 50 vertical levels in the ocean, with 22 evenly spaced levels within the top 220 m. The ocean component has poles over North America and Eurasia to avoid polar filtering. Neither coupled model employs flux adjustments. The co ntrol simulations have stable, realistic climates when integrated over multiple centuries. Both models have simulations of ENSO that are substantially improved relative to previous GFDL coupled models. The CM2.0 model has been further evaluated as an ENSO forecast model and has good skill (CM2.1 has not been evaluated as an ENSO forecast model). Generally reduced temperature and salinity biases exist in CM2.1 relative to CM2.0. These reductions are associated with 1) improved simulations of surface wind stress in CM2.1 and associated changes in oceanic gyre circulations; 2) changes in cloud tuning and the land model, both of which act to increase the net surface shortwave radiation in CM2.1, thereby reducing an overall cold bias present in CM2.0; and 3) a reduction of ocean lateral viscosity in the extratropics in CM2.1, which reduces sea ice biases in the North Atlantic. Both models have be en used to conduct a suite of climate change simulations for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report and are able to simulate the main features of the observed warming of the twentieth century. The climate sensitivities of the CM2.0 and CM2.1 models are 2.9 and 3.4 K, respectively.

Plots exposed to natural grazing were dominated either by encrusting algae or by red algal turf and articulated corallines. Algae fluctuated in response to El Ni\u00f1o in the following way. During an early phase, crustose Gymnogongrus and/or red algal turf were dominant. In the heart of El Ni\u00f1o, grazers had limited effects on algal cover but influenced algal sizes substantially. Most algae (particularly edible forms) were scarce or declined, although warm-water ephemeral species (notably Giffordia mitchelliae) flourished, increasing diversity and overgrowing crusts. Iguana mortalities were high, and crab densities low. When normal conditions returned, warm-water ephemerals declined, crab densities rose, and grazers had significant but site-specific effects on algae. At one site, any combination of grazers diminished most erect species, reducing diversity and restoring dominance of competitively inferior grazer-resistant crusts. At a second site, only the combined effect of all grazers had this effect. Laboratory experiments confirmed that crabs could control erect algae and promote crustose forms, and crustose Gymnogongrus developed into an erect form in the absence of crabs. Differences between sites and large-scale temporal changes associated with El Ni\u00f1o indicate that tropical shores are not all as constant in time and space as previously suggested. Mobile grazers did affect algal communities, but over the period of our observations far greater effects were attributable to intersite differences and temporal shifts in oceanographic conditions.

Intense seasonality and short pelagic foodwebs on the Antarctic shelf may favor strong bentho-pelagic coupling, whereas unusual water depth combined with complex topography and circulation could cause such coupling to be weak. Here, we address six questions regarding the nature and strength of coupling between benthic and water-column processes on the continental shelf surrounding Antarctica. We find that water-column production is transmitted to the shelf floor in intense pulses of particulate organic matter, although these pulses are often difficult to correlate with local phytoplankton blooms or sea-ice conditions. On regional scales, benthic habitat variability resulting from substrate type, current regime, and iceberg scour often may obscure the imprint of water-column productivity on the seafloor. However, within a single habitat type, i.e. the muddy sediments that characterize much of the deep Antarctic shelf, macrobenthic biomass appears to be correlated with regional primary production and sea-ice duration. Over annual time-scales, many benthic ecological processes were initially expected to vary in phase with the extraordinary boom/bust cycle of production in the water column. However, numerous processes, including sediment respiration, deposit feeding, larval development, and recruitment, often are poorly coupled to the summer bloom season. Several integrative, time-series studies on the Antarctic shelf suggest that this lack of phasing may result in part from the accumulation of a persistent sediment food bank that buffers the benthic ecosystem from the seasonal variability of the water column. As a consequence, a variety of benthic parameters (e.g., sediment respiration, inventories of labile organic matter, macrobenthic biomass) may act as \"low-pass\" filters, responding to longer-term (e.g., inter-annual) trends in water-column production. Bentho-pelagic coupling clearly will be altered by Antarctic climate change as patterns of sea-ice cover and water-column recycling vary. However, the nature of such climate-driven changes will be very difficult to predict without further studies of Antarctic benthic ecosystem response to (1) inter-annual variability in export flux, and (2) latitudinal gradients in duration of sea-ice cover and benthic ecosystem function. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate models predict that the temperature in arid Central Asia will increase by 1-2\u00b0C by 2030-2050, with the greatest increases in wintertime. Some models project greater aridity in the future though others project less aridity, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that climate change modeling in arid zones is extremely uncertain because of the extreme natural variability (both temporal and spatial) of the desert climate. The physical differences of climate change forcings imply that one might expect quite different regional responses to future human-induced climate change compared to the Holocene climate in terms of their rapidity and amplitude.

The Everglades mangrove estuaries are characterized by salinity gradients that vary spatially with topography and vary seasonally and inter-annually with rainfall, tide, and freshwater flow from the Everglades. Because of their location at the lower end of the Everglades drainage basin, Everglades mangrove estuaries have been affected by upstream water management practices that have altered the freshwater heads and flows and that affect salinity gradients. Additionally, interannual variation in precipitation patterns, particularly those caused to El Ni\u00f1o events, control freshwater inputs and salinity dynamics in these estuaries. Two major external drivers on this system are water management activities and global climate change. These drivers lead to two major ecosystem stressors: reduced freshwater flow volume and duration, and sea-level rise. Major ecological attributes include mangrove forest production, soil accretion, and resilience; coastal lake submerged aquatic vegetation; resident mangrove fish populations; wood stork (Mycteria americana) and roseate spoonbill (Platelea ajaja) nesting colonies; and estuarine crocodilian populations. Causal linkages between stressors and attributes include coastal transgression, hydroperiods, salinity gradients, and the \"white zone\" freshwater/estuarine interface. The functional estuary and its ecological attributes, as influenced by sea level and freshwater flow, must be viewed as spatially dynamic, with a possible near-term balancing of transgression but ultimately a long-term continuation of inland movement. Regardless of the spatio-temporal timing of this transgression, a salinity gradient supportive of ecologically functional Everglades mangrove estuaries will be required to maintain the integrity of the South Florida ecosystem. \u00a9 2005, The Society of Wetland Scientists."], "title": "A conceptual model of ecological interactions in the mangrove estuaries of the Florida Everglades"},

The ASTAR project was centered on two aircraft measurement campaigns, scheduled from 2004 to 2005, addressing both aerosol and cloud measurements, combined with ground-based and satellite observations. In the present paper one example for the analysis of ground-based aerosol particles is described. The sampling of aerosol particles was performed in a well-known manner by impaction of the particles on cleaned graphite targets. By means of a cascade impactor eight size classes between 0.35 and 16.6 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameters were separated.

An argon flow transports the vaporized sample material into the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) used as ionization source for the time of flight-mass spectrometer (TOF-MS). The simultaneous extraction of the ions from the plasma, as realized in the TOF instrument, allows to obtain the full mass spectrum of the sample during the vaporization pulse without any limitation in the number of elements detected.

It is mainly based on the climatic proxy that we can study the past climate change.

For example, we judge if the climate is flood/drought or cold/warm through linear trend of the time series, however, we do not know whether it is a natural variation or the result of external forces, the mechanism is not uncovered. Because complexity of the open global climate system, there are different characteristics among the climatic proxies from different region of the world, from which it is difficult to reveal the intrinsic general principles i.e. the globality. For the further study on the past climate change, especially to reveal the rules of the global climate change in past 2000a and predict future climate change, a new method making use of the dynamical lag correlation exponent (named Q index in the text), a dynamics exponent based on the phase-space reconstruction, is introduced in this paper, which can effectively discern the similarities or differences between the dynamics of the two series. With Q index, we analyze the dynamics structure of some typical climatic proxies. The results show that the dynamics of climatic proxies are almost similar, and the regional climate keeps the same change with the global. In other words, regional climate is controlled by the global climate change.

A major question of our retrospective approach is whether Quaternary tree extinctions took place primarily during glacial or during interglacial episodes. Available data are scanty and somewhat conflicting. In contrast, abundant phylogeographic evidence clearly indicates that the bulk of genetic diversity in European temperate tree species is almost invariably located in the southernmost part of their range. Long-term persistence of isolated populations have been common phenomena in the Mediterranean, to the point that the current genetic structure in this area probably often reflects population divergence that pre-dates the onset of the Mediterranean climate in the Pliocene. In particular, Tertiary migrations into the Mediterranean of tree taxa originating from Asia seem to have left their footprints in the current genetic structure in these slowly evolving organisms. Moreover, phylogeographic studies point to heterogeneous rates of molecular evolution across lineages that are inversely related with their stability. We conclude that relict tree populations in the Mediterranean Basin represent an evolutionary heritage of disproportionate significance for the conservation of European plant biodiversity."], "title": "Climate changes and tree phylogeography in the Mediterranean"},

Biodiversity conservation of grasslands in the face of transformation and global climate change will depend mainly on rangelands because of insufficient conservation areas in regions suited to agriculture. Transformed vegetation (pastures, crops and plantations) is not expected to conserve much biodiversity. This study examined the impact of land use on the plant diversity and community composition of the southern Drakensberg grasslands in South Africa, which are threatened with complete transformation to pastures, crops and plantations. 2. The main land uses in this high rainfall region are: ranching or dairy production under private tenure using indigenous grassland, pastures (Eragrostis curvula, kikuyu and ryegrass) and maize; plantation forestry; communal tenure (maize and rangelands); and conservation. 3. Plant diversity and composition were assessed using Whittaker plots. Transformed cover types were depauperate in species and ranged from kikuyu (1\u00b74 species m ", ") and ryegrass (2\u00b79), to pine plantation (3\u00b71), E. curvula pasture (3\u00b71), commercial maize (3\u00b72) and communal maize (7\u00b78). With the exception of pine plantations, these communities supported mostly exotic (50 of 70 species) or ruderal indigenous species and made little contribution to plant species conservation. Abandoned communal cropland reverted to an indigenous grassland almost devoid of exotic species within c. 20 years. 4. It was predicted that frequently cultivated sites (maize and ryegrass) would support less diversity than long-lived pastures (kikuyu and E. curvula). This was contradicted by the relatively high species diversity of communal maize fields, which was attributed to a lack of herbicides, and the depauperate communities of kikuyu and of E. curvula pasture, which were attributed, respectively, to a dense growth form and a severe mowing regime. 5. Pine plantations harboured fourfold more indigenous species per plot (27) than other transformed types. Species were mostly shade-tolerant grassland relics that had persisted for 12 years since planting, and some forest colonizers. Indigenous species were unlikely to be maintained because of aggressive invasion by the exotic Rubus cuneifolius and severe disturbance associated with tree harvest and replanting. 6. The richness of indigenous grasslands was expected to differ in response to grazing pressure but they differed only in composition. Grasslands were dominated by grasses, despite the richness of herbaceous species. The dominance of Themeda triandra was reduced under livestock grazing in favour of more grazing-tolerant species. Exotic species were inconspicuous except for the dicotyledon Richardia brasiliensis, a subdominant under communal grazing. 7. Southern Drakensberg grasslands are probably now stocked with livestock six- to 35-fold higher than during pre-settlement times. A grassland protected for c. 50 years supported twofold greater richness (101 species plot", ") than grazed grasslands, suggesting that a 150-year history of increased mammalian grazing had already reduced plant diversity. 8. Synthesis and applications. Land acquisition is costly, thus conservation of plant diversity in the southern Drakensberg requires a policy that inhibits transformation of rangelands. This can be achieved by enhancing their economic viability without changing the vegetation composition. Their inherent value must be recognized, such as for water production. The viability of commercial ranches can be improved by increasing their size. Conservation efforts need to be focused on plant taxa that only occur on unprotected rangelands. \u00a9 2005 British Ecological Society."], "title": "Influence of land use on plant community composition and diversity in Highland Sourveld grassland in the southern Drakensberg, South Africa"},

Due to strong fluctuations of its water level during the 20th century and the flooding of vast areas in a highly vulnerable coastal zone, economic and environmental risk potentials have to be considered. Since the major water input into the CS is attributed to the Volga river, the understanding of its long-term flow process is necessary for an appropriate risk assessment for the CS and its coastal area. Therefore, a top-down approach based on statistical analyses of long-term Volga flow series is pursued. For the series of annual mean flow (MQ) of the Volga river basin during the 20th century, a complex oscillation pattern was identified. Analyses for multiple gauges in the Volga river basin and Eurasian reference basins revealed that this oscillation pattern resulted from the superposition of oscillations with periods of \u223c30 years (MQ) in the western part of the Volga river basin, and \u223c14 years (flow volume of snowmelt events) and \u223c20 years (flow volume of summer and autumn) in the eastern part of the Volga river basin (Kama river basin). Almost synchronous minima or maxima of these oscillations occurred just in the periods of substantial changes of the Caspian Sea level (CSL). It can thus be assumed that the described mechanism is fundamental for an understanding of the CSL development during the 20th century.

To achieve a better understanding of the changes in C storage, we need to be able to accurately measure and model inputs and losses of C from soils. This in turn requires a thorough understanding of the biological processes involved and the way in which they are influenced by the soil's physical and chemical environment. The amount of C present in a soil is determined by the difference between C addition and C loss. Because these fluxes are large relative to changes in C storage, net storage can be very difficult to measure, particularly in the short term. Carbon is added to soil from plant and animal materials deposited on the soil surface. It is known that approximately 50% of C assimilated by young plants can be transferred below ground; some is used for root construction and maintenance as well as root respiration; some organic C is lost to the soil through exudation and root turnover. A comparison of eight studies has shown that the input to the soil of root derived organic C during a growing season can range between 0.1 and 2.8 t C ha", ". Quantifying inputs from different processes has proved difficult and the relative importance of exudation and root death under field conditions remains uncertain. The chemical composition of substrates released by exudation and root death is known to be very different. Exudates contain high concentrations of soluble organic substrates and as a consequence are highly labile, whereas additions of C from root death have structural organic substrates with lower potential decomposition rates. Losses of C from soil occur as a consequence of plant and microbial respiration. However, identifying the source of evolved CO", ", whether it be from root or microbial respiration, is much more difficult. Some new methods using isotopic labelling and pool dilution have been developed to separate plant and microbial respiration, and despite difficulties, these promise to provide valuable information on the processes of C input and loss from soils. At a field scale measurements and models would suggest that soil and crop management can play a significant role in determining the extent of C sequestration by soils and the proportion of labile C present. A comparison of 11 field studies showed that soil respiration varies between 4 and 26 t C ha", " year", ", with management such as tillage, drainage, grazing and manure application exerting a strong influence on the magnitude of fluxes. Net ecosystem exchange of C has been shown to be at least an order of magnitude lower than respiratory losses in comparable studies, but land management is important in determining the direction and magnitude of the C flux. Recent studies have suggested that although the overall quantity of C stored in European soils is increasing, this increase is confined largely to forested areas and that many cropped soils are losing soil organic matter. It is has been suggested that that the biological potential for C storage in European cropland lies between 9 and 120 Mt C year", ".

Recent work, however, raised the possibility that dispersal among mountain ranges is an important process in the biogeography of boreal mammals in the Great Basin. We test this proposition using genetic variation in a representative species, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris). A total of 332 marmots was sampled from 10 ranges and genotyped at six microsatellite loci. If the intervening desert lowlands are impermeable barriers to dispersal, then there should be no relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance among mountaintop populations, and genetic diversity should be diminished because gene flow would not be available to replace alleles lost over thousands of generations of isolation. Our results did not support these predictions. There was a strong correlation between genetic and geographic distance, demonstrating an isolation-by-distance pattern, and genetic diversity was high. Our results suggest that marmot populations in the Great Basin may be linked by dispersal, providing a mechanism to replenish genetic variation lost by drift.

Wheat plants respond to drought through morphological, physiological and metabolic modifications in all plant parts. At the cellular level, plant responses to water deficit may result from cell damage, whereas other responses may correspond to adaptive processes. Although a large number of drought-induced genes have been identified in a wide range of wheat varieties, a molecular basis for wheat plant tolerance to water stress remains far from being completely understood.

Ocean sciences have been driven by technologies enabling new observations, discoveries, and modelling of diverse interdisciplinary phenomena. Despite rapid advances in ocean sampling capabilities, the numbers of disciplinary variables that are necessary to solve oceanographic problems are large and increasing. In addition, the time and space scales of key processes span over ten orders of magnitude; presently, there remain major spectral gaps in our sampling. Thus, undersampling presents the main limitation to our understanding of global climate change; variability in fish biomass and regime shifts; and episodic and extreme events. Fortunately, recent advances in ocean platforms and in situ autonomous sampling systems and satellite sensors are enabling unprecedented rates of data acquisition as well as the expansion of temporal and spatial coverage. Consequently, improved sampling strategies will lead to a reduction in ocean forecasting error for predictions of a multitude of atmospheric and oceanic processes. Nonetheless, major challenges remain to massively increase the variety and quantity of ocean measurements and to effectively coordinate, synthesize, and distribute oceanographic data sets. In particular, numbers of measurements are limited by the costs of instruments and their deployment as well as data processing and production of useful data products and visualizations.

We experimentally transplanted hard corals from a shallow reef with highly variable seawater temperature (23-36\u00b0C) to three unfished marine parks and three fished reefs with variable coral predator abundance and benthic cover. The transplanted corals were fragmented colonies collected from a reef that was relatively undisturbed by the 1997-1998 warm-water temperature anomaly, one of the most extreme thermal events of the past century, and it was assumed that they would represent corals likely to succeed in the future temperature environment. We examined the effects of four taxa, two fragment sizes, an acclimation period, benthic cover components, predators and tourists on the survival of the coral fragments. We found the lowest survival of transplants occurred in the unfished marine parks and this could be attributed to predation and not tourist damage. The density of small coral recruits approximately 6 months after the spawning season was generally moderate (~40-60/m", "), and not different on fished and unfished reefs. Coral recovery between 1998 and 2002 was variable (0-25%), low (mean of 6.5%), and not different between fished and unfished reefs. There was high variability in coral mortality among the three unfished areas despite low variation in estimates of predator biomass, with the highest predation occurring in the Malindi MNP, a site with high coralline algal cover. Stepwise multiple regression analysis with 14 variables of coral predators and substratum showed that coralline algae was positively, and turf algae negatively associated with mortality of the transplants, with all other variables being statistically insignificant. This suggests that alternate food resources and predator choices are more important than predator biomass in determining coral survival.

Here we present a detailed investigation of the amount of unburned material remaining in the ash produced by such fires and examine whether this quantity needs to be considered when calculating atmospheric emissions. Emissions estimates for individual fires are usually based upon a calculation of the amount of fuel biomass combusted, usually estimated via a \"simple subtraction\" of the pre- and post-fire fuel loads. However, certain studies have concluded that this approach leads to gross overestimation of emissions, by perhaps 100%, due to the fact that a proportion of unburned fuel normally remains in the \"charred\" ash and that the simple subtraction method fails to take this fully into account. Whilst this latter point is true, we show that the mathematical relationship used previously to calculate the implications of this for emissions calculation is flawed. We demonstrate a new first-principles derivation of the quantity of mass combusted, taking into account any fuel remaining in the ash via measurement of ash mass loss on ignition (LOI). Using data from dry-season experimental fires in Botswana, we compared estimates of biomass combusted calculated via our LOI-based method to those obtained via the simple subtraction approach. We found a mean difference of <10%, far less than the factor of 2 difference obtained when using the previous erroneous formula. Similar results are obtained for carbon and nitrogen emissions, and the findings are further supported by reassessment of previous data from early-to-mid-dry season savanna fires in Tanzania. These results indicate that the simple subtraction method overestimates emissions by far less than previously suggested, and that the method is likely to provide sufficient accuracy in most situations where emissions calculations are required. For fires where very substantial amounts of unburned material are expected to remain within the ash, and where an LOI-based approach to emissions calculation may therefore be particularly warranted, it is important that the correct formula derived herein is used, since errors inherent in the previous formula increase with increasing ash LOI. \u00a9 2005 by the Ecological Society of America."], "title": "Fire in African savanna: Testing the impact of incomplete combustion on pyrogenic emissions estimates"},

Analyses conducted with and without controlling for host phylogeny showed that parasite species richness increased closer to the equator for protozoan parasites, but not for viruses or helminths. Relative to other major parasite groups, protozoa reported from wild primates were transmitted disproportionately by arthropod vectors. Within the protozoa, our results revealed that vector-borne parasites showed a highly significant latitudinal gradient in species richness. This higher diversity of vector-borne protozoa near the tropics could be influenced by a greater abundance or diversity of biting arthropods in the tropics, or by climatic effects on vector behaviour and parasite development. Many vector-borne diseases, such as leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and malaria pose risks to both humans and wildlife, and nearly one-third of the protozoan parasites from free-living primates in our data set have been reported to infect humans.

This in turn has increased the need for policy makers to promote electricity generation from renewable energy sources. Guaranteed prices coupled with a buy-back obligation for electricity fed into the grid is a popular renewables promotion instrument, especially in Europe. More recently, driven mainly by electricity market liberalisation efforts, quota targets for the share of renewables in combination with tradable 'green' certificates (TGC) have received considerable attention. TGC offer a greater theoretical potential for economic efficiency gains, due to price competition and the greater flexibility assigned to the obliged parties. While guaranteed prices and TGC schemes support the operation of renewable energy technology systems, bidding schemes for renewable energy generation capacity are used to raise economic efficiency on the plant construction side. All of these policy instruments suffer from the shortcoming that they do not explicitly account for the often widely varying environmental, social and economic impacts of the technologies concerned. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the design of renewable energy policy instruments that is based on integrated assessment. In particular, we argue that using participatory multicriteria evaluation as part of the design of renewable energy promotion policies would make it possible: (1) to differentiate the level of promotion in a systematic and transparent manner according to their socio-ecological economic impact, and (2) to explicitly account for the preferences of stakeholders. A further problem of existing TGC and bidding schemes is that diversity of supply could be severely diminished, if few low-cost technologies were allowed to dominate the renewable energy market. To ensure a certain diversity of technologies, our scheme suggests the use of different technology bands for technologies that are relatively homogeneous with respect to their maturity. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

There is presently a large-scale State-Federal program to restore the delta that includes construction of water control structures in the flood control levees to divert river water into deteriorating wetlands and pumping of dredged sediment, often for long distances, for marsh creation. Global climate change and decreasing availability and increasing cost of energy are likely to have important implications for delta restoration. Coastal restoration efforts will have to be more intensive to offset the impacts of climate change including accelerated sea level rise and changes in precipitation patterns. Future coastal restoration efforts should also focus on less energy-intensive, ecologically engineered management techniques that use the energies of nature as much as possible.

We also examined the temporal dynamics of calcium, potassium, and magnesium in the leaf litter. Leaf litter [P] and %N changed significantly with time, both seasonally and inter-annually. Seasonal changes in leaf litter [P] were strongly positively correlated with rainfall from the previous 2 weeks; cations, however, were inversely related to this measure of current rainfall, while %N was not related to rainfall. We propose that the positive relationship between current rainfall and leaf litter [P] is due to a response by the vegetation to an increase in nutrient availability and uptake. In contrast, given the negative relationship between current rainfall and cation concentrations, leaching from live leaf tissue is a more likely driver of short-term changes in cations.

However, uncertainties in the magnitude and spatio-temporal variations of the terrestrial carbon sink and in understanding the underlying mechanisms have not been reduced significantly. One of the major reasons is that the observations and experiments were conducted at individual scales independently, but it is the interactions of factors and processes at different scales that determine the dynamics of the terrestrial carbon sink. Since experiments and observations are always conducted at specific scales, to understand cross-scale interactions requires mechanistic analysis that is best to be achieved by mechanistic modeling. However, mechanistic ecosystem models are mainly based on data from single-scale experiments and observations and hence have no capacity to simulate mechanistic cross-scale interconnection and interactions of ecosystem processes. New-generation mechanistic ecosystem models based on new ecological theoretical framework are needed to quantify the mechanisms from micro-level fast eco-physiological responses to macro-level slow acclimation in the pattern and structure in disturbed ecosystems. Multi-scale data-model fusion is a recently emerging approach to assimilate multi-scale observational data into mechanistic, dynamic modeling, in which the structure and parameters of mechanistic models for simulating cross-scale interactions are optimized using multi-scale observational data. The models are validated and evaluated at different spatial and temporal scales and real-time observational data are assimilated continuously into dynamic modeling for predicting and forecasting ecosystem changes realistically.

The later now can be predicted with good accuracy. By using this prediction, the expected cosmic ray variations in the near Earth space also can be estimated with a good accuracy.

Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems usually causes depletion of 50 to 75 percent of the antecedent SOC pool, thereby creating a potential sink capacity of as much as 35 to 40 Mg C/ha. The depletion of SOC pool leads to decline in soil quality and resilience with attendant reduction in biomass productivity, decreased capacity to degrade and filter pollutants, increased risks of soil degradation by erosion and other processes, and increase in emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The magnitude of depletion of SOC pool is greater for soils of the tropics than temperate regions, and for farms which are resource-based and managed with low-input than those managed with science-based and judicious off-farm inputs. The SOC sequestration, increasing SOC pool through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), can reverse soil degradation trends, improve soil quality and resilience, increase biomass production and decrease emission of GHGs. A strong link exists between the labile fraction of SOC pool and soil biodiversity-the activity and species diversity of soil fauna (micro, meso and macro) and micro-organisms. Soil biodiversity is usually higher under pastures and planted fallow systems than under crops, and is likely to increase with adoption of conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and manuring, mixed farming systems and integrated pest management (IPM) techniques.

The results show strong similarities in the behaviour of the two models, although RothC tends to simulate slightly smaller changes in global soil carbon stocks for the same forcing. RothC simulates global soil carbon stocks decreasing by 54 Gt C by 2100 in a climate change simulation compared with an 80 Gt C decrease in HadCM3LC. The multipool carbon dynamics of RothC cause it to exhibit a slower magnitude of transient response to both increased organic carbon inputs and changes in climate. We conclude that the projection of a positive feedback between climate and carbon cycle is robust, but the magnitude of the feedback is dependent on the structure of the soil carbon model. \u00a9 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."], "title": "Global climate change and soil carbon stocks; predictions from two contrasting models for the turnover of organic carbon in soil"},

To assess the conservation-genetic priorities for this species, the genetic diversity of 20 populations sampled from the largest remnant patches at northern and southern distributional extremes, the McPherson and Barrington ranges (a total of 146 individuals), was investigated by using inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR). Regeneration in northern regions of N. moorei has been documented to be predominantly by vegetative means, but our results indicate little evidence of clonality outside the multi-stemmed rings of trees. In addition, genetic diversity was considerably higher in the northern (McPherson, h = 0.1613) than in the southern range (Barrington, h = 0.1159), and genetic differentiation was significantly positively correlated with geographic distance in the former region, but not the latter. Total intraspecific variation was moderate, as measured by Shannon's diversity index, I = 0.2719, and Nei's gene diversity, h = 0.1672, and is considered at the high end of spectrum for estimates of narrow endemic species. An analysis of molecular variation indicated that the majority of genetic variation is partitioned among individuals within population (60%; P < 0.001), rather than among populations within regions (10%; P < 0.001). However, a large and significant component of the measured diversity was partitioned between northern and southern regions (29%; P < 0.001). Several hypotheses are outlined to explain these differences and management implications are discussed. However, given the narrow range, poor dispersal mechanism and restriction to cool temperate rainforest, the continued existence of N. moorei is most threatened by environmental instability and habitat loss resulting from global climate change. In this context the northern regions of the species are most at risk and extinction of such populations would lead to a significant loss of genetic variation for the species as a whole. \u00a9 CSIRO 2005."], "title": "Genetic diversity and regional identity in the Australian remnant Nothofagus moorei"},

To derive the broadband albedo accurately from satellite optical sensor observation at limited bands and at a single observation angle, the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) has to be specified quantitatively. In the present albedo derivation algorithms from the satellite radiance data, the BRF is either modelled or observed. Questions may arise as to how well a BRF model can be in the broadband albedo derivation. To help answer such questions, we studied the performance of a snow-surface BRF model for two specific cases under large solar zenith angles (65\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 . We measured snow-surface spectral directional reflectance under clear skies. The snow physical properties, such as snow grain size and snow density, at the same sites were also measured. In situ snow physical data are used to simulate the snow-surface BRF and hemispherical directional reflectance factor (HDRF) through a multilayered azimuth- and zenith-dependent plane-parallel radiative transfer model. The field measurements and BRF and HDRF simulations all reveal the forward-scattering nature of snow surface under large solar incidence angles, but the BRF model results depict the strongest forward-scattering patterns under such solar zenith angles. Because the HDRF is simulated through coupling of the surface BRF with radiative transfer in the atmosphere, the resulting HDRF patterns agree with the field measurements better than the simulated BRF does. The deviation of the simulated HDRF from field-based clear-sky directional reflectance (FCDR) is within \u00b110% for the central (viewing zenith angle < 45\u00b0) and lateral sides of the viewing hemisphere. This level of agreement between the simulated HDRF and FCDR also implies that the simulated BRF model can provide remote-sensing estimates of spectral albedo with an uncertainty of \u00b110% for the same part of the viewing hemisphere. Further improvement in BRF model performance requires better handling of single scattering properties of snow grains, surface roughness, and atmospheric correction. Also, better procedures and techniques in field measurement are necessary for more accurate assessment of the performance of BRF models.

For some of these lakes, it is known that subsequent drainage had an abrupt and widespread impact on North Atlantic Ocean circulation and climate, but less is known about the impact that the lakes exerted on ice sheet dynamics. This paper reports palaeogeographic reconstructions of the evolution of proglacial lakes during deglaciation across the northwestern Canadian Shield, covering an area in excess of 1,000,000 km ", " as the ice sheet retreated some 600 km. The interactions between proglacial lakes and ice sheet flow are explored, with a particular emphasis on whether the disposition of lakes may have influenced the location of the Dubawnt Lake ice stream. This ice stream falls outside the existing paradigm for ice streams in the Laurentide Ice Sheet because it did not operate over fined-grained till or lie in a topographic trough. Ice margin positions and a digital elevation model are utilised to predict the geometry and depth of proglacial lakes impounded at the margin at 30-km increments during deglaciation. Palaeogeographic reconstructions match well with previous independent estimates of lake coverage inferred from field evidence, and results suggest that the development of a deep lake in the Thelon drainage basin may have been influential in initiating the ice stream by inducing calving, drawing down ice and triggering fast ice flow. This is the only location alongside this sector of the ice sheet where large (>3000 km ", "), deep lakes (\u223c120 m) are impounded for a significant length of time and exactly matches the location of the ice stream. It is speculated that the commencement of calving at the ice sheet margin may have taken the system beyond a threshold and was sufficient to trigger rapid motion but that once initiated, calving processes and losses were insignificant to the functioning of the ice stream. It is thus concluded that proglacial lakes are likely to have been an important control on ice sheet dynamics during deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Each of these stresses has complex, yet distinct, interactions with global change variables, making it very difficult to predict how plants in these environments will respond to future climate scenarios. Important, yet poorly understood, interactions include the effects of transpiration on root acquisition of soluble nutrients, particularly Ca and Si, the effects of altered root architecture on the acquisition of immobile nutrients, particularly P, the effects of altered root exudate production on Al toxicity and transition metal acquisition, and the interaction of photochemical processes with transition metal availability. The interaction of Mn toxicity with light intensity and other global change variables is discussed as an example of the complexity and potential importance of these relationships. Current conceptual models of plant response to multiple resource limitations are inadequate. Furthermore, substantial genetic variation exists in plant responses to mineral stress, and traits improving adaptation to one stress may incur tradeoffs for adaptation to other stresses. Root traits under quantitative genetic control are of central importance in adaptation to many mineral stresses.

The success of conventional crop improvement over the past 50 years for drought tolerance forms a baseline against which new genetic methods must be compared. Selection based on performance in multi-environment trials (MET) has increased grain yield under drought through increased yield potential and kernel set, rapid silk exertion, and reduced barrenness, though at a lower rate than under optimal conditions. Knowledge of the physiology of drought tolerance has been used to dissect the trait into a series of key processes. This has been complemented by genetic dissection through the identification of QTL associated with these same traits. Both have been used to identify suitable organ- and temporal-specific promoters and structural genes. Phenotyping capacity has not kept pace with the exponential increase in genotypic knowledge, and large-scale managed stress environments (MSE) are now considered essential to further progress. These environments provide ideal settings for conducting massively parallel transcript profiling studies, and for validating candidate regions and genes. Genetic and crop physiological models of key processes are now being used to confirm the value of traits for target environments, and to suggest efficient breeding strategies. Studies of gene to phenotype relationships suggest that most putative drought tolerance QTL identified thus far are likely to have limited utility for applied breeding because of their dependency on genetic background or their sensitivity to the environment, coupled with a general lack of understanding of the biophysical bases of these context dependencies. Furthermore, the sample of weather conditions encountered during progeny selection within the multi environment testing of conventional breeding programs can profoundly affect allele frequency in breeding populations and the stress tolerance of elite commercial products. We conclude that while gains in kernels per plant can be made by exploiting native genetic variation among elite breeding lines, improvements in functional stay-green or in root distribution and function may require additional genetic variation from outside the species.

The emerging discipline of genomics offers promise of providing such tools, and may provide a unique opportunity to enhance genetic gains and stabilize global crop production. Genomics has developed from the confluence of genetics, automated laboratory tools for generating DNA- and RNA-based data, and methods of information management. Functional genomics concentrates on how genes function, alone and in networks, while structural genomics focuses on physical and structural aspects of the genome. The traditional strengths of physiology lie in interpreting whole plant response to environmental signals, dissecting traits into component processes, and predicting correlated responses when genes and pathways are perturbed.

Combining physiological and genetic information can provide a more complete model of gene-to-phenotype relationships and genotype-by- environment interactions.

Numerous measurements have been performed in the last three decades in order to characterize polar aerosols. Information about aerosol characteristics is needed to calculate induced changes in the Earth's heat balance. However, this forcing is highly variable in space and time. Accurate quantification of forcing by aerosols will require combined efforts, assimilating information from different sources such as satellite, aircraft and surface-based observations. Adding to the complexity of the problem is that the measurements themselves are often not directly comparable as they vary in spatial/temporal resolution and in the basic properties of the aerosol that they measure. Therefore it is desirable to close the gap between the differences in temporal and spatial resolution and coverage among the observational approaches. In order to keep the entire information content and to treat aerosol variability in a consistent and manageable way an approach has to be achieved which enables one to combine these data. This study presents one possibility for linking together a complex Arctic aerosol data set in terms of parameters, timescale and place of measurement as well as meteorological parameters. A cluster analysis was applied as a pattern recognition technique. The data set is classified in clusters and expressed in terms of mean staristical values, which represent the entire database and its variation. For this study, different time-series of microphysical, optical and chemical aerosol parameters as well as meteorological parameters were analysed. The database was obtained during an extensive aerosol measurement campaign, the ASTAR 2000 (Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosol and Radiation) field campaign, with coordinated simultaneous ground-based and airborne measurements in the vicinity of Spitsbergen (Svalbard). Furthermore, long-term measurements at two ground-based sites situated at different altitudes were incorporated into the analysis. The approach presented in this study allows the necessary linking of routine long-term measurements with short-term extensive observations.

The Canadian health burden from waterborne illness is unknown, although it presumably accounts for a significant proportion of enteric illness. Recently, large outbreaks with severe consequences produced by E. coli O157:H7 and Cryptosporidium have alarmed Canadians and brought demands for political action. A concurrent need to understand the health impacts of global climate changes and to develop strategies to prevent or prepare for these has also been recognized. There is mounting evidence that weather is often a factor in triggering waterborne disease outbreaks. A recent study of precipitation and waterborne illness in the United States found that more than half the waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States during the last half century followed a period of extreme rainfall. Projections of international global climate change scenarios suggest that, under conditions of global warming most of Canada may expect longer summers, milder winters, increased summer drought, and more extreme precipitation.

Such species interactions will presumably become more important in the future, as Global Climate Change takes effect on terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated plant-plant interactions in the High Arctic, following the growth of Luzula confusa and Salix polaris in pure and mixed stands, and under elevated-temperature treatment over 2 years. To understand the mechanisms of competition, a parallel experiment was undertaken in phytotrons, manipulating competition, temperature and nutrient availability. Our findings indicate that competition is acting in the natural vegetation, and that climatic warming will alter the balance of interactions in favour of the dwarf shrub S. polaris. The phytotron experiment suggested that the mechanism is a higher responsiveness of Salix to nutrient availability, which increased under warming in the field. While Luzula showed a positive response to higher temperature in the lab, its performance in mixed stands in the field was actually reduced by warming, indicating a competitive repression of growth by Salix. The growth of Salix was also reduced by the presence of Luzula, but it was still able to profit from warming. Our findings suggest that climatic warming will result in greater shrub dominance of High Arctic tundra, but we also conjecture that grazing could reverse the situation to a graminoid-dominated tundra.

In the fen, the effect of IR loading on G was modulated by water table depth, whereas in the bog it was not. Energy dissipation from the mesocosms occurred mainly via vertical exchange with air, as well as with deeper soil layers through the bottom of the mesocosms, whereas lateral fluxes were 10-20-fold smaller and independent of IR loading and water table depth.

The most significant indirect effect is expected to result from cruel reduction in worldwide grains (concentrate feedstuffs) production. This change will impose need to tradeoff between the diminished food sources: using higher proportions of grains production for human nutrition, instead of feeding it to livestock. Similar conflict is expected to be relevant in using high-quality forages that can be used as edible food for humans. Heat stress imposed by high ambient temperature in temperate zones, such as in Germany, northern Italy and the US was identified in recent years as a major factor that affect negatively milk production, reproduction, and the health of dairy cows. Heat stress also has shown to increase appreciably cow's mortality in those areas. On the other hand, there is no evidence that dairy goat production in temperate zones is affected so far; though, evidence for such an effect was notice in desert and Mediterranean (e.g., Turkey) countries. The major aim of this critical review is to analyze the literature in order to predict how the current trend in harshening of the impact of climatic changes affect dairy industry and to forecast how CC will affect the dairy cows and goat industry in countries located within the temperate zone? Particularly, the direct effects of heat stress on milk production are emphasized. Among domestic ruminants, goats are the most adapted species to imposed heat stress in terms of production, reproduction and resistance to diseases. The main conclusion that can be made is that uttermost scenarios of climatic change will negatively affect the dairy industry and that the importance of goats to the dairy industry will increase in proportion to the severances of changes in environmental temperature. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V."], "title": "Impact of climate change on the dairy industry in temperate zones: Predications on the overall negative impact and on the positive role of dairy goats in adaptation to earth warming"},

The heavy minerals show a progressive increase in glacially sourced materials from the bottom to the top of the Bytham River third terrace sediments.

Owing to a careful relative calibration of the 10 thermistors used in this experiment, these data establish that the ceiling temperature is higher than the floor temperature by 0.04 to 0.28 \u00b0C.

Variations with periods larger than 1 week, with an amplitude two times smaller and a phase lag on the floor with respect to the ceiling, are observed from June to October. These cycles are linked to the sign of the seasonal heat flux. We propose an interpretation in which heat transfer in the cavity is dominated by diffusion of water vapour from June to October (heat flux downwards, summer regime) and by convective water transport from November to May (heat flux upwards, winter regime). The water flow inferred from this model can be used to predict the water saturation of the rock as a function of time. Because of a permanent radiative heat flux from top to bottom, the upward water flow in the winter regime is larger than the downward water flow in the summer regime, resulting in a slow depletion of water from the rock below the cavity. This unbalanced water flow could contribute to an observed steady secular increase of rock resistivity, and possibly also to the long-term temperature increase of 0.1 \u00b0C per year.

Many animals use environmental cues available before the breeding season to predict the seasonal peak in food availability and adjust their phenology accordingly. We tested the hypothesis that regulation of breeding onset should reflect the scale at which organisms perceive their environment by comparing phenology of three seabird species at a North Sea colony. As predicted, the phenology of two dispersive species, black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and common guillemot (Uria aalge), correlated with a large-scale environmental cue (the North Atlantic Oscillation), whereas a resident species, European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), was more affected by local conditions (sea surface temperature) around the colony. Annual mean breeding success was lower in late years for European shags, but not for the other two species. Since correlations among climate patterns at different scales are likely to change in the future, these findings have important implications for how migratory animals can respond to future climate change. \u00a9 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."], "title": "Scale-dependent climate signals drive breeding phenology of three seabird species"},

In order to analyse quantitatively the trade-off between omission and commission errors, we suggest the use of the 'Pareto Boundary', a method rooted in economics theory applied to decisions with multiple conflicting objectives. Starting from a high-resolution reference dataset, it is possible to determine the maximum user and producer's accuracy values (i.e. minimum omission and commission errors) that could be attained jointly by a low-resolution map. The method has been developed for the specific case of dichotomic classifications and it has been adopted in the evaluation of burned area maps derived from SPOT-VGT with Landsat ETM+ reference data. The use of the Pareto Boundary can help to understand whether the limited accuracy of a low spatial resolution map is given by poor performance of the classification algorithm or by the low resolution of the remotely sensed data, which had been classified. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A shift in climate from cool-wet to warm-dry conditions facilitated comparison of climate-vegetation relationships during two distinct periods: 1957-1976 and 1977-1996. For each treeline, tree radial growth and seedling establishment were correlated against monthly and seasonal temperature, precipitation, moisture availability, and two indices of El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO): southern oscillation index (SOI) and sea surface temperature (SST). Four key aspects of climatic influences on N. pumilio radial growth and seedling establishment were as follows. (1) The relationship between krummholz radial growth and temperature variation was non-linear. (2) Moisture availability was the dominant climatic factor influencing seedling establishment, although temperature-precipitation interactions resulted in variability among study areas. (3) Climate conditions that facilitated Nothofagus pumilio seedling establishment were distinct, and often opposite, from those that enhanced radial growth. (4) The relationships of radial growth and seedling demography with climate and ENSO differed among study areas and have been unstable over the past 40 years. Observed spatial and temporal instabilities in vegetation-climate relationships demonstrate the complexity of treeline dynamics in northern Patagonia under a changing climate.

Additional to various goods and services being provided to human beings, forest ecosystems are a large store of terrestrial carbon and account for a major part of the carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface. Depending on the management regime, forests can thus be either a sink, or a source of atmospheric carbon. Southeast Asia or ASEAN comprises 10 countries of different cultures and political background. Rapid economic development and fast-growing population in the region have raised much concern over the use of natural resources, especially forest resources. This study aims at finding the appropriate measures for sustainable use and management of tropical forests on a long-term basis. Between 1990 and 2000, about 2.3millionha of forest were cleared every year and lost to other forms of land use. In terms of carbon emissions, a net amount of approximately 465milliont per year were released to the atmosphere over the same period, which amounts to 29% of the global net carbon release from deforestation worldwide. This study provides an approach to analyzing the implications of alternative forest and land management options on forest carbon stocks. This is done in three steps: First, observed trends in land use are expressed in terms of a model in order to create a scenario for the period 1980-2050. Second, forest management practices and timber production rates are analyzed and three management scenarios are created: (1) continuing the current rate of exploitation, (2) management for long-term economic gains, and (3) climate-beneficial management. Third, the impact of the three scenarios on regional carbon storage is estimated on the basis of a carbon balance model. Comparing the additional rate of carbon sequestration of scenario (3) over scenario (2), and taking into account differing management costs, we also discuss a framework for industrialized countries to invest in carbon credits in the region in order to fulfil their commitments under present and future climate protection agreements. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The idea is based on the premise that the future change of TC track characteristics is primarily determined by changes in large-scale environmental steering flows and in formation locations. It is demonstrated that the main characteristics of the current climatology of TC tracks can be derived from the climatological mean velocity field of TC motion by using a trajectory model. The climatological mean velocity of TC motion, composed of the large-scale steering and beta drift, is determined on each grid of the basin. The mean large-scale steering flow is computed from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis for the current climate state. The mean beta drift is estimated from the best-track data by removing the steering flow. The derived mean beta drift agrees well with the results of previous observational and numerical studies in terms of its direction and magnitude. The approach is applied to assessing the potential impacts of global warming on TC tracks in the WNP. The possible changes in the large-scale steering flows are taken from the output wind fields of two Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) global warming experiments and possible changes in the TC formation locations are considered by shifting the formation locations as a whole. The GFDL experiments suggested that the changes in the future large-scale steering flows are dominated by the easterly anomalies in the Tropics and westerly anomalies in the midlatitudes with the enhanced northward component during the period of 2030-59. Based on the assessments using two different ways to reduce climate model biases, the prevailing TC tracks shift slightly southwestward during the period of 2000-29, but northeastward during the period of 2030-59. More TCs will take a recurving track and move northeastward during the period of 2030-59.

In addition, a better understanding of the effects of natural disturbances on C cycling is critical, particularly in light of alterations to disturbance regimes that may occur with global climate change. However, quantitative data about how postfire differences in ecosystem structure affect C allocation patterns are lacking. For this study, we examined how above- and belowground C pools, fluxes, and allocation patterns varied with fire-initiated differences in tree density and stand age in lodgepole pine stands in Yellowstone National Park of four forest types: low (<1000 trees/ha), moderate (7000-40 000 trees/ha), and high tree densities (>50 000 trees/ha) in 13-year-old stands, and in \u223c110-year-old mature stands. C pools in live biomass and detritus were estimated with allometric equations and direct sampling. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was estimated as aboveground biomass increment plus fine litterfall, and total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) was estimated using a C balance approach. Our results indicate that the magnitude of C pools and fluxes varies greatly with fire-initiated differences in tree density and stand age. Coarse woody debris and mineral soil carbon accounted for the majority of total ecosystem C in young stands (91-99%), in contrast to mature stands where the largest amount of C was found in live biomass (64%).

An ensemble of climate change simulations that use a standard prescription for time-dependent increases of greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol concentrations is compared to a multiple-century control simulation with these constituents fixed at preindustrial levels. The primary response to climate change is to zonalize the atmospheric circulation, that is, to reduce the amplitude of the stationary waves in all seasons. This zonalization is particularly strong in the boreal summer over the Tropics. In January, changes in the stationary waves resemble that of an El Ni\u00f1ol, and all months exhibit an El Ni\u00f1o-like increase of precipitation in the central tropical Pacific. The dynamics of the stationary wave changes are studied with a linear stationary wave model, which is shown to simulate the stationary wave response to climate change remarkably well. The linear model is used to decompose the response into parts associated with changes to the zonal-mean basic state and with changes to the zonally asymmetric \"forcings\" such as diabatic heating and transient eddy fluxes. The decomposition reveals that at least as much of the climate change response is accounted for by the change to the zonal-mean basic state as by the change to the zonally asymmetric forcings. For the January response in the Pacific-North American sector, it is also found that the diabatic heating forcing contribution dominates the climate change response but is significantly cancelled and phase shifted by the transient eddy forcing. The importance of the zonal mean and of the diabatic heating forcing contrasts strongly with previous linear stationary wave models of the El Ni\u00f1o, despite the similarity of the January stationary wave response to El Ni\u00f1o. In particular, in El Ni\u00f1o, changes to the zonal-mean circulation contribute little to the stationary wave response, and the transient eddy forcing dominates.

NLCs are high-altitude clouds in the earth's mesosphere that are formed from visible aerosol particles. The occurrence rate of NLCs over time is believed to have profound implications on global climate change. NLCs are often associated with PMSEs which are strong 50 MHz-1.3 GHz radar echoes from mesospheric electron irregularities. Therefore, PMSEs may be an important remote-sensing diagnostic for the evolution of NLCs and the earth's middle atmosphere in general. The electron irregularities that produce PMSEs are generally believed to result from charging of electrons onto subvisible aerosol irregularities, the source of which is currently a debated issue. Neutral air turbulence has long been considered a primary source of the irregularities. However, there are clearly fundamental characteristics of the irregularities in past and recent observations that cannot be explained by neutral air turbulence and most probably involve plasma processes. This work considers the latter mechanism and the possibility of production of aerosol irregularities in the boundary region between the charged aerosol layer and the background mesospheric plasma. First a model for investigating the electrodynamics of this boundary layer is described. This model indicates that plasma flows are expected to exist in the electrodynamic equilibrium. An initial assessment of the possible role of these plasma flows in producing irregularities that may ultimately result in PMSEs is provided."], "title": "Electrodynamic structure of charged dust clouds in the earth's middle atmosphere"},

The present work shows that these hydrologic changes exhibit a strong dependence on elevation, with the greatest loss of snowpack volume in the 1300-2700 m elevation range. Exploiting hydrologic and estuarine modeling capabilities to trace water as it moves through the system reveals that the shift of water in mid-elevations of the Sacramento river basin from snowmelt to rainfall runoff is the dominant cause of projected changes in estuarine inflows and salinity. Additionally, although spring-summer losses of estuarine inflows are balanced by winter gains, the losses have a stronger influence on salinity since longer spring-summer residence times allow the inflow changes to accumulate in the estuary. The changes in inflows sourced in the Sacramento River basin in approximately the 1300-2200 m elevation range thereby lead to a net increase in estuarine salinity under the projected warming.

Mutualistic symbioses are a fundamental feature of coral reefs that have been used to explain their structure, biodiversity and existence. Complex inter-relationships between hosts, habitats and symbionts belie closely coupled nutrient and community dynamics that create the circumstances for \"something from nothing\" (or the \"oasis in a nutrient desert\"). The flip side of these dynamics is a close dependency between species, which results in a series of non-linear relationships as conditions change. These responses are being highlighted as anthropogenic influences increase across the world's tropical and subtropical coastlines. Caribbean as well as Indo-Pacific coral populations are now in a serious decline in many parts of the world. This has resulted in a significant reorganization of how coral reef ecosystems function. Among the spectra of changes brought about by humans is rapid climate change. Mass coral bleaching - the loss of the dinoflagellate symbionts from reef-building corals - and mortality has affected the world's coral reefs with increasing frequency and intensity since the late 1970s. Mass bleaching events, which often cover thousands of square kilometres of coral reefs, are triggered by small increases (+1-3\u00b0C) in water temperature. These increases in sea temperature are often seen during warm phase weather conditions (e.g. ENSO) and are increasing in size and magnitude. The loss of living coral cover (e.g. 16% globally in 1998, an exceptionally warm year) is resulting in an as yet unspecified reduction in the abundance of a myriad of other species. Projections from general circulation models (GCM) used to project changes in global temperature indicate that conditions even under the mildest greenhouse gas emission scenarios may exceed the thermal tolerances of most reef-building coral communities. Research must now explore key issues such as the extent to which the thermal tolerances of corals and their symbionts are dynamic if bleaching and disease are linked; how the loss of high densities of reef-building coral will affect other dependent species; and, how the loss of coral populations will affect the millions of people globally who depend on coral reefs for their daily survival."], "title": "Coral reefs in a century of rapid environmental change"},

Fire activity is controlled by a number of biophysical factors, including climate, whose relevance varies across regions and landscapes. In light of the ongoing climate change, understanding the fire-climate relationships is an issue of current interest in order to identify the most vulnerable regions. Building upon recent global observations of burned areas and climate, we investigate the sensitivity of fire activity to fire-weather across the world's major biomes. We identify the biomes susceptible to inter-annual fire-weather fluctuations, unveiling a non-linear relationship with a saturation threshold past which the area burned can be considered insensitive to increasing fire-weather. Our results depict an unambiguous spatial pattern that identifies the world regions where short-term climate fluctuations are unlikely to produce any significant effect on current fire activity, and those most sensitive to fire-weather changes. In particular, the boreal forests and extensive areas of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (excluding Africa) as well as sizeable areas of temperate broadleaf forests are identified as highly sensitive. We then present near-future fire-weather scenarios (period 2026-2045) using a state-of-the-art ensemble or Earth System Models (ESMs) from the CMIP5 database, considering a moderate and a high emission scenario (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). The projected anomalies in fire-weather for the vulnerable temperate biomes are small in magnitude and their direction is either negative or just slightly positive, although significant differences in the projected probability density functions suggest that disruptions of fire regimes may occur locally. Other sensitive ecosystems, like the rain forests of the Amazon basin may experience a significant increment in fire-weather that may result in severe impacts on fire regimes as a direct consequence of climate change in the next decades. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V."], "title": "Global patterns in the sensitivity of burned area to fire-weather: Implications for climate change"},

Global arable land use embodied in international trade is estimated near one third the global arable land use, and that embodied in intermediate use is almost twice that embodied in final demand. Arable land use trade patterns are noted in terms of production-based imports/exports and consumption-based imports/exports. Most notably, Mainland China is shown as the leading production-dominated importer. With regard to other large economies, Canada is found as a production-oriented exporter, in contrast to Australia as a consumption-oriented exporter. Japan is identified as a production-oriented importer, while the United States is a consumption-oriented importer. As heavy trade imbalance is revealed prevailing not only between countries and regions but also between intermediate products and final goods, the study to explore global supply chains of arable land use can provide essential policy making implications for security and sustainability in arable land use and food supply on both global and regional scales. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd."], "title": "Global supply chain of arable land use: Production-based and consumption-based trade imbalance"},

Fire activity is controlled by a number of biophysical factors, including climate, whose relevance varies across regions and landscapes. In light of the ongoing climate change, understanding the fire-climate relationships is an issue of current interest in order to identify the most vulnerable regions. Building upon recent global observations of burned areas and climate, we investigate the sensitivity of fire activity to fire-weather across the world's major biomes. We identify the biomes susceptible to inter-annual fire-weather fluctuations, unveiling a non-linear relationship with a saturation threshold past which the area burned can be considered insensitive to increasing fire-weather. Our results depict an unambiguous spatial pattern that identifies the world regions where short-term climate fluctuations are unlikely to produce any significant effect on current fire activity, and those most sensitive to fire-weather changes. In particular, the boreal forests and extensive areas of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (excluding Africa) as well as sizeable areas of temperate broadleaf forests are identified as highly sensitive. We then present near-future fire-weather scenarios (period 2026-2045) using a state-of-the-art ensemble or Earth System Models (ESMs) from the CMIP5 database, considering a moderate and a high emission scenario (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). The projected anomalies in fire-weather for the vulnerable temperate biomes are small in magnitude and their direction is either negative or just slightly positive, although significant differences in the projected probability density functions suggest that disruptions of fire regimes may occur locally.

The Baltic Sea in Northern Europe is one of the systems most affected. In addition to being exposed to persistent eutrophication, intensive fishing, and one of the world's fastest rates of warming in the last two decades of the 20th century, accelerated climate change including atmospheric warming and changes in precipitation is projected for this region during the 21st century. Here, we used a new multimodel approach to project how the interaction of climate, nutrient loads, and cod fishing may affect the future of the open Central Baltic Sea food web. Regionally downscaled global climate scenarios were, in combination with three nutrient load scenarios, used to drive an ensemble of three regional biogeochemical models (BGMs). An Ecopath with Ecosim food web model was then forced with the BGM results from different nutrient-climate scenarios in combination with two different cod fishing scenarios. The results showed that regional management is likely to play a major role in determining the future of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. By the end of the 21st century, for example, the combination of intensive cod fishing and high nutrient loads projected a strongly eutrophicated and sprat-dominated ecosystem, whereas low cod fishing in combination with low nutrient loads resulted in a cod-dominated ecosystem with eutrophication levels close to present. Also, nonlinearities were observed in the sensitivity of different trophic groups to nutrient loads or fishing depending on the combination of the two. Finally, many climate variables and species biomasses were projected to levels unseen in the past. Hence, the risk for ecological surprises needs to be addressed, particularly when the results are discussed in the ecosystem-based management context. \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."], "title": "Combined effects of global climate change and regional ecosystem drivers on an exploited marine food web"},

We detail and explore the significance of assumptions used in these calculations.We present a new test of this model in which we show that the predicted energy budget sizes for 11 populations of the lizard Sceloporus undulalus are in close agreement with observed results from previous field studies. This demonstrates that model tests are feasible and the results are reasonable.

This study was conducted to seek the benefits of municipal solid waste (MSW) pretreatment, as well as the differences in methane production from the landfilling of untreated and mechanically/biologically treated (MBT) MSW using GasSim simulation. Results demonstrated that methane production rates vary significantly among waste fractions. Those that contribute most to methane generation (organic material and potentially reusable or recyclable material) could be targeted and treated before landfilling. The statistic relationship from the first phase of the study indicated that to match the increasingly stringent landfill waste organic content allowance, local councils should prioritize the reduction/sorting of certain targeted fractions, such as paper, card, green waste, and other putrescibles from MSW. Moreover, mechanical treatment alone produces organic-rich waste called mechanically sorted organic residues (MSORs), which can be viewed as an organic content concentration process. Mechanically and biologically pretreated waste, on the other hand, differs significantly from untreated MSW and MSORs. This work demonstrated that if efficient mechanical-biological treatment is used, considerable reductions in biological activity, landfill gas production, and energy content/total organic carbon could be achieved. Using GasSim, reductions in methane production of >74% have been simulated if a 90% organic content reduction can be achieved during biological treatment on MSORs.

At the regional scale, we suggest that attention can be focused more dearly on understanding the relative strengths of predicted net primary productivity (NPP) limitation by energy, water, and nutrients. We evaluate the sources of variability among model predictions of NPP with a regional-scale comparison between estimates made by PnET-II (a forest ecosystem process model previously applied to the northeastern region) and TEM 4.0 (a terrestrial biosphere model typically applied to the globe) for the northeastern US. When the same climate, vegetation, and soil data sets were used to drive both models, regional average NPP predictions made by PnET-II and TEM were remarkably similar, and at the biome level, model predictions agreed fairly well with NPP estimates developed from field measurements. However, TEM 4.0 predictions were more sensitive to regional variations in temperature as a result of feedbacks between temperature and belowground N availability. In PnET-II, the direct link between transpiration and photosynthesis caused substantial water stress in hardwood and pine forest types with increases in solar radiation; predicted water stress was relieved substantially when soil water holding capacity (WHC) was increased. Increasing soil WHC had little effect on TEM 4.0 predictions because soil water storage was already sufficient to meet plant demand with baseline WHC values, and because predicted N availability under baseline conditions in this region was not limited by water. Because NPP predictions were closely keyed to forest cover type, the relative coverage of low- versus high-productivity forests at both fine and coarse resolutions was an important determinant of regional NPP predictions. Therefore, changes in grid cell size and differences in the methods used to aggregate from fine to coarse resolution were important to NPP predictions insofar as they changed the relative proportions of forest cover. We suggest that because the small patches of high-elevation spruce-fir forest in this region are substantially less productive than forests in the remainder of the region, more accurate NPP predictions will result if models applied to this region use land cover input data sets that retain as much fine-resolution forest type variability as possible. The differences among model responses to variations in climate and soil WHC data sets suggest that the models will respond quite differently to scenarios of future climate. A better understanding of the dynamic interactions between water stress, N availability, and forest productivity in this region will enable models to make more accurate predictions of future carbon stocks and fluxes."], "title": "Sources of variability in net primary production predictions at a regional scale: A comparison using PnET-II and TEM 4.0 in northeastern US forests"},

Additionally, there is little information on the internal processes of the Arctic ice pack, which are important for determining the variability of the ice cover. In an effort to address these issues, the variability of the Arctic ice volume is examined using a single column sea ice-ocean mixed layer model. The model contains an ice thickness distribution and the parameterization of export and ridging due to ice divergence and shear. Variability in the ice cover is forced by applying stochastic perturbations to the air temperature and ice divergence forcing fields. Several sensitivity tests are performed in order to assess the role of different physical processes in determining the variability of the perennial Arctic ice pack. It is found that the surface albedo and ice-ocean feedback mechanisms act to enhance the variability of the ice volume and are particularly important for the simulated response of the sea ice to fluctuations in air temperature, accounting for approximately 62% and 25% of the ice volume variance, respectively. The details of the ice thickness distribution also significantly affect the simulated variability. In particular, the ridging process acts to decrease the simulated variability of the ice pack.

Forest health surveys that focus on the average forest condition may do a credible job of representing the near - term trends in economic value while failing to detect fundamental changes in the processes by which these values are sustained over the longer term. Indications of increased levels of environmental stress on forest growth and nutrient cycles are currently apparent in several forest types in North America. Measurements of forest ecophysiological responses to air pollutants in integrated case studies with four forest types (southern pine, western pine, high elevation red spruce, and northeastern hardwoods) indicate that ambient levels of ozone and/or acidic deposition can alter basic processes of water, carbon, and nutrient allocation by forest trees. These changes then provide a mechanistic basis for pollutant stress to enhance a wider range of natural stresses that also affect and are affected by these resources. Future climatic changes may ameliorate (+ CO", ") or exacerbate (+ temperature, + UV- B) these effects. Current projections of forest response to global climate change do not consider important physiological changes induced by air pollutants that may amplify climatic stresses. These include reduced rooting mass, depth, and function, increased respiration, and reduced water use efficiency. Monitoring and understanding the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic stress in influencing future forest health will require programs that are structured to evaluate res rises at appropriate frequencies across gradients in both forest resources and the stresses that influence them.

Location: The Atlantic coast of the United States (on a latitudinal gradient from 42\u00b0to 25\u00b0N). Methods: Using the descriptive techniques of cluster analysts and nonmetric multidimensional scaling, we determined the similarities in benthic community composition between sites within 1\u00b0latitudinal bands and compared the biotic ordinations to natural habitat characteristics such as salinity, sediment type and depth. We then evaluated the overall community composition within each 1\u00b0latitudinal band and established whether or not similarities existed between adjacent 1\u00b0latitudinal bands. In this manner, we were able to confirm that a latitudinal gradient existed in estuarine benthic community composition along the western Atlantic coast.

Results: The major divisions approximated widely recognized biogeographical boundaries.

Linear regressions of stream temperature versus air temperature are attractive for this purpose, because they require only one input variable (air temperature) which can be simulated by General Circulation Models (GCMs) better than other climate variables. Under a warmer climate scenario, high stream temperatures must be projected by extrapolation. The questions arises whether linear extrapolation is valid. To answer the question, the heat exchange processes that contribute to surface water temperature have been analyzed and related to air temperature on a weekly time scale. The equilibrium temperature concept introduced by Edinger has been used. In stream reaches with large drainage area, stream temperature can be approximated by equilibrium temperature. At elevated air temperatures, the vapor pressure deficit above a water surface increases drastically (even in humid regions) causing strong evaporative cooling and hence a flatter stream temperature/air temperature relationship. At low air temperatures, stream temperatures often reach 0\u00b0C as an asymptote. If an upstream flow control (dam, reservoir release) or a waste heat input is present, the lower asymptotic value can be larger than 0\u00b0C.

The radiative properties are based on the assumption that cirrus clouds are composed of hexagonal crystals. For the infrared component, a new mass absorption coefficient is parameterized to calculate emissivity, and for the solar, single-scattering properties from an existing parameterization are modified and employed. The solar and infrared optical properties are given as a function of ice water content and effective particle size. Aircraft observations are used to parameterize the microphysical properties in terms of temperature, thus allowing the radiative properties to interact with the local model climate. The interactive cirrus radiative parameterization is evaluated in model-to-observation comparisons with a comprehensive set of cloud and radiation measurements obtained during the spring 1994 and fall 1995 Intensive Observation Periods of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program. It is shown that the model with the new parameterization calculates realistic infrared radiation and improved solar radiation incident at the surface. Specifically, biases in calculated solar direct and diffuse fluxes are reduced by 60 and 40%, respectively. Further, the shortwave flux is shown to be more sensitive than the longwave flux to variability in the ice water content and in the base and top heights of observed clouds replicated in model calculations.

The global mean sea level variations measured by T/P every 10 days have an RMS of 4 mm and a rate of change +3.1 \u00b1 1.3 mm/year, after accounting for an average instrument drift computed using the global tide gauge network by Mitchum (1998). A likely cause of the observed instrument drift is the microwave radiometer, which provides the water vapor delay correction, which results in a revised estimate of +2.5 mm/year if the error is assumed to be linearly related to the mean water vapor delay. Approximately half of this rise appears related to an increase in sea level that began in mid-1996, thus it is unlikely to be sustained over the long term. Estimates of sea level change over the major ocean basins reveal that the North Atlantic has risen over the T/P mission, and this is believed to be related to decadal, changes in heat storage. Maps of the geographic variability of the observed sea level trends are currently dominated by ENSO variations, and thus the climate change signals cannot currently be isolated. These results suggest that T/P, when combined with tide gauge monitoring of the satellite instruments, is achieving the necessary accuracy to distinguish sea level rise caused by climate change from the natural 'background' rate of sea level rise, although a longer time series is necessary to average out possible interannual and decadal variations. A longer time series will also reduce the errors in estimates of the altimeter calibration, providing an important constraint on any long-term instrument drift. Future research will focus on establishing a more realistic error budget for these measurements of global mean sea level, so that they can be put in the proper context with other observations of global climate change. In addition, the study of the spatial variability of the sea level rise signal will become increasingly important as a longer time series is collected."], "title": "Measuring very low frequency sea level variations using satellite altimeter data"},

Assessments of gas hydrate as an energy resource have often been overly optimistic, based in part on its very high methane content and on its worldwide occurrence in continental margins. Although these attributes are attractive, geologic settings, reservoir properties, and phase-equilibria considerations diminish the energy resource potential of natural gas hydrate. The possible role of gas hydrate in global climate change has been often overstated. Although methane is a 'greenhouse' gas in the atmosphere, much methane from dissociated gas hydrate may never reach the atmosphere, but rather may be converted to carbon dioxide and sequestered by the hydrosphere/biosphere before reaching the atmosphere. Thus, methane from gas hydrate may have little opportunity to affect global climate change. However, submarine geohazards (such as sediment instabilities and slope failures on local and regional scales, leading to debris flows, slumps, slides, and possible tsunamis) caused by gas-hydrate dissociation are of immediate and increasing importance as humankind moves to exploit seabed resources in ever-deepening waters of coastal oceans.

The first, called 'Ricardian' by Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, and Shaw (1994), econometrically estimates the impact of climatic and other variables on the value of farm real estate. Under some conditions, estimates of climate-induced changes in farm real estate capture first-round adaptations by farmers and represent the economic value of climatic change on agriculture. The second method, promulgated by Darwin et al. (1994) in the Future Agricultural Resources Model (FARM), uses a geographic information system to empirically link climatically derived land classes with other inputs and agricultural outputs in an economic model of the world. FARM provides estimates of economic impacts that fully account for all responses by economic agents under global climate change as well as estimates of Ricardian rents. The primary objective of this analysis is to evaluate how well changes in Ricardian rents measure agricultural or other effects of climatic change after all economic agents around the world have responded. Results indicate that changes in Ricardian rents on agricultural land are poor quantitative, but good qualitative, measures of how global climatic change is likely to affect the welfare of agricultural landowners, if one recognizes that increases in Ricardian rents actually indicate losses in landowner welfare and vice versa. Results also indicate that regional changes in Ricardian rents on all land are good qualitative measures of changes in regional welfare. They are poor quantitative welfare measures because they systematically overestimate both benefits and losses and are on average upwardly biased because inflated benefits are larger than exaggerated losses. Results also indicate that, when based on existing land-use patterns, changes in Ricardian rents on all the world's land are poor quantitative and qualitative measures of changes in world welfare. Despite these shortcomings, changes in Ricardian rents can provide useful information when other measures are not available. In this analysis, for example, estimated changes in Ricardian rents on all land indicate that climatic change would likely have detrimental effects in Latin America and Africa, beneficial effects in the former Soviet Union, and either detrimental or beneficial impacts in eastern and northern Europe and western and southern Asia. This is consistent with previous studies showing that climatic change would likely have detrimental, beneficial, and mixed effects on economic welfare in, respectively, equatorial, high latitude, and temperate areas. Estimated changes in Ricardian rents also indicate that aggregating Africa, Latin America, the former Soviet Union, eastern and northern Europe, and western and southern Asia into one region causes FARM's economic model to generate upwardly biased changes in world welfare. Modified results from scenarios with moderately flexible land-use change and which account for current land-use patterns indicate that world welfare may increase if the average surface land temperature does not increase by more than 1.0 or 2.0\u00b0C. If the average surface land temperature increases by 3.0\u00b0C or more, however, then world welfare may decline."], "title": "A farmer's view of the Ricardian approach to measuring agricultural effects of climatic change"},

Molecular genetic studies are revealing the presence of cryptic taxa, and patterns of gene flow in coral reef species, that do not correspond to present day ocean circulation patterns. Concordant borders of genetic inhomogeneity in several taxa emphasise the influence of historical barriers to gene flow. The persistence of genetic differences between sites apparently connected by present-day currents provides evidence for lack of effective contemporary gene exchange. A review of the limited data available to date cannot be conclusive, but suggests that present patterns of genetic variation in the Indo-Pacific have resulted from highly pulsed dispersal events associated with range expansion during interglacial periods. Thus, population genetic structure appears to be dominated by events associated with global climate change and sea level fluctuation during the last 1-3 million years, rather than vicariant geological events in the early Caenozoic. Regional speciation outside the tropical Indo-West Pacific and movement of these species into that region may have played a more important role in producing diversity in that region than traditionally recognised. Some genetic variants have arisen before, and have persisted through, several cycles of climate change. The genetic structure of populations is likely to have been maintained for several thousand years after they were first established, during or immediately after range expansion, by the occurrence of co-adapted gene complexes of some form, and because of more limited opportunity for dispersal than has been assumed to date."], "title": "Genetic structure of coral reef organisms: Ghosts of dispersal past"},

Consequently, probabilistic risk estimates of most of the likely regional health impacts of GCC have such a high degree of uncertainty that their usefulness to health officials dealing with regional issues is very limited. With the numerous pressures on today's health care systems, it is understandable that the possible consequences of GCC have received scant attention from regional health care decision makers. Indeed, the consensus among this community appears to be that any increases in health effects associated with GCC will be easily handled by the current health care system. However, such a position may be naive as the potential exists that an unequal distribution of such effects could overwhelm some regions, whereas others may feel little or no impact. This review of the likely regional impacts of GCC has been structured as a semianalytical look at this issue of distributional effects. Because of the lack of dose-response information and reliable estimates of future regional climates, however, it takes a historical perspective. That is, it assumes that the quality and quantity of health risks a region faces under GCC will be directly related to its recent history of health risks from warm weather/climate-related diseases as well as to the size, characteristics, and distribution of the sensitive subpopulations currently residing within its borders. The approach is semiquantitative; however, it uses national data gathered on a regional level and as such should only be used to generate a hypothesis rather than test it. When applied to the United States, its outcome leads to the hypothesis that if indeed history repeats itself, some states or regions may be more greatly affected by GCC than others, not only because historically they are more prone to summer weather/climate-related diseases, but also because they contain a greater proportion of the sensitive subpopulations in the United States."], "title": "Public health consequences of global climate change in the United States - Some regions may suffer disproportionately"},

Describing transport across phase boundaries becomes as, or even more, important as quantifying transport within the phases; (2) POPs may persist in the environment for many decades. For chemicals that 'have time', concepts such as equilibrium partitioning and steady-state become more important than for short-lived substances whose fate is more controlled by the rates of transformation; (3) measuring POPs is difficult and expensive and observed concentrations of POPs are not available in high spatial or temporal resolution. Consequently, high resolution tends not to be a high priority in POP models; and (4) detrimental effects of POPs often manifest themselves in top predators, which has led to a focus on modelling biotic uptake and transfer within food chains. The task of building a POPs model is viewed as combining the four 'building blocks' of partitioning, transport, transformation and source data with the help of the law of the conservation of mass.

Because photosynthesis rates in co-occurring tree species can differ in their sensitivity to environmental conditions, these changes in species composition are likely to alter the carbon dynamics of temperate forests. To help improve our understanding of such atmosphere-biosphere interactions, we explored changes in leaf-level photosynthesis in a 60-70 yr old temperate mixed-deciduous forest in Petersham, Massachusetts (USA). Diurnally and seasonally varying environmental conditions differentially influenced in situ leaf-level photosynthesis rates in the canopies of four mature temperate deciduous tree species: red oak (Quercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), white birch (Betula papyrifera), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). We measured in situ photosynthesis at two heights within the canopies (top of the canopy at ~20 m, and in the sub-canopy of the same individual trees at ~14-16 m) through a diurnal time course on 7 d over two growing seasons. We simultaneously measured a suite of environmental conditions surrounding the leaf at the time of each measurement. We used path analysis to examine the influence of environmental factors on in situ photosynthesis in the tree canopies. Overall, red oak had the highest photosynthesis rates, followed by white birch, yellow birch, and red maple. There was little evidence for a substantial midday depression in photosynthesis. Instead, photosynthesis declined throughout the day, particularly after 1600. Diurnal patterns of light reaching canopy leaves, leaf and air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) contributed to diurnally varying photosynthesis rates. Large differences in these parameters through the growing season partly led to the seasonal differences observed in photosynthesis rates. Path analyses helped to identify the relative contribution of various environmental factors on photosynthesis and further revealed that species-specific sensitivities to various environmental conditions shifted through the season. Red oak photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to air temperatures late in the season when air temperatures were low. Further, red maple photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to high VPDs through the growing season. Incorporating data on the physiological differences among tree species into forest carbon models will greatly improve our ability to predict alterations to the forest carbon budgets under various environmental scenarios such as global climate change, or with differing species composition."], "title": "How environmental conditions affect canopy leaf-level photosynthesis in four deciduous tree species"},

Analyses of three-year segments of these time series, equivalent to the length of field observations in a typical doctoral study, revealed only high-frequency seasonal cycles in abundance. Only 30% of the segments exhibited the 'correct' long-term trends, although the slopes were different, whereas coefficients of variability were generally underestimated, by as much as fourfold. Similarly, estimates of mean abundance were out by between two and four times. Multidimensional scaling ordinations of the entire species assemblage (approximately 12 species) revealed that the community occupies several distinct states, as defined by the relative abundance of component species. These states may persist for between 18 months and 5 years and in any three-year segment the community may change from one state to another, further confounding analyses from short time series.

To explore this possibility further, we examine a simple oceanographic-ecological model designed to simulate the warm and cool phases of the Pacific Ocean cycle and gauge its effect on local coral reefs. This allows us to identify causes for localized 'hot spots' in the ocean, whose high sea surface temperatures have disastrous consequences for corals. The underlying wave dynamics of the model lead to chaotic oscillations (every ~3-4 yr), which help explain the coexistence of both order and irregularity in the dynamics of mass bleaching. The model makes use of a temperature threshold mechanism-a bleaching event is triggered whenever temperature anomalies exceed a critical level. In a variable environment, the threshold mechanism is sensitive to background fluctuations, and their effects are studied by making use of a 'stochastic resonance' formulation. Global climate change and other trends in external background environmental conditions are all shown to strongly influence the distribution of mass coral bleaching events."], "title": "Chaos in the Pacific's Coral reef bleaching cycle"},

It is found that frequency distributions of tropical Pacific CAPE, as well as the dependence of CAPE on surface wet-bulb potential temperature (\u0398w) simulated by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies's GCM, agree well with that observed during the Australian Monsoon Experiment period. CAPE variability in the current climate greatly overestimates climatic changes in basinwide CAPE in the tropical Pacific inresponse to a 2\u00b0C increase in sea surface temperature (SST) in the GCM because of the different physics involved. In the current climate, CAPE variations in space and time are dominated by regional changes in boundary layer temperature and moisture, which in turn are controlled by SST patterns and large-scale motions. Geographical structure variations in the middle and upper troposphere are smaller because of the canceling effects of adiabatic cooling and subsidence warming in the rising and sinking branches of the Walker and Hadley circulations. In a forced equilibrium global climate change, temperature change is fairly well constrained by the change in the moist adiabatic lapse rate and thus the upper troposphere warms to a greater extent than the surface. For this reason, climate change in CAPE is better predicted by assuming that relative humidity remains constant and that the temperature changes according to the moist adiabatic lapse rate change of a parcel with 80% relative humidity lifted from the surface. The moist adiabatic assumption is not symmetrically applicable to a warmer and colder climate: In a warmer regime moist convection determines the tropical temperature structure, but when the climate becomes colder the effect of moist convection diminishes and the large-scale dynamics and radiative processes become relatively important. Although a prediction based on the change in moist adiabat matches the GCM simulation of climate change averaged over the tropical Pacific basin, it does not match the simulation regionally because small changes in the general circulation change the local boundary layer relative humidity by 1%-2%. Thus, the prediction of regional climate change in CAPE is also dependent on subtle changes in the dynamics."], "title": "CAPE variations in the current climate and in a climate change"},

We therefore examined the effects of dispersal and species interactions on the distribution and abundance of three Drosophila species in a laboratory system that mimicked a latitudinal cline of 15\u00b0C.

In pairwise interactions, Drosophila subobscura eliminated D. melanogaster or D. simulans at low temperatures but was itself eliminated at high temperatures. 5. Competitive interactions changed abundance and range sizes thus shifting the position of species optima. These changes depended on both the number and the identity of the competing species. 6. Enemy-victim interactions altered range and abundance. Adding the parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi affected the host assemblage directly at high temperatures where the parasitoid was present, and indirectly (mediated by dispersal) at low temperatures where it was scarce or absent.

Studies of combustion efficiency in natural fires, as the proportion of initial biomass actually volatilized, are rare, and we know of no estimates of mass and N retention in residual ash and partially combusted biomass that are related to fire temperature. We burned plots instrumented with thermocouples to measure fire temperature and analyzed biomass from adjacent clipped plots, residual post-fire plant residue, and ash to determine the proportion of biomass actually burned and N volatilized. Data from experimental savanna grassland fires under natural conditions in Serengeti National Park indicate that (1) the proportions of mass and N volatilized are substantially less than 100%, (2) most fuel loads are within a range where combustion and volatilization are highly dependent on mass burned and resultant fire intensity, (3) proportionally more N than mass is volatilized, particularly as fire intensity increases, but (4) much less mass and N are volatilized in natural fires than laboratory estimates suggest. Therefore, (5) obtaining accurate estimates of emissions from natural fires will be substantially more difficult than is reflected in current methodology."], "title": "Combustion in natural fires and global emissions budgets"},

However, tremendous controversy exists in the literature as to which is the best method to determine fine root biomass and production. This lack of consensus makes it difficult for researchers to determine which methods are most appropriate for their system. The sequential root coring method was the most commonly used method to collect root biomass data in the past and is still commonly used. But within the last decade the use of minirhizotrons has become a favorite method of many researchers. In addition, due to the high labor-intensive requirements of many of the direct approaches to determine root biomass, there has been a shift to develop indirect methods that would allow fine root biomass and production to be predicted using data on easily monitored variables that are highly correlated to root dynamics. Discussions occur as to which method should be used but without gathering data from the same site using different methods, these discussions can be futile. This paper discusses and compares the results of the most commonly used direct and indirect methods of determining root biomass and production: sequential root coring, ingrowth cores, minirhizotrons, carbon fluxes approach, nitrogen budget approach and correlations with abiotic resources. No consistent relationships were apparent when comparing several sites where at least one of the indirect and direct methods were used on the same site.

We examined the potential added risk posed by global climate change on dengue transmission using computer-based simulation analysis to link temperature output from three climate general circulation models (GCMs) to a dengue vectorial capacity equation. Our outcome measure, epidemic potential, is the reciprocal of the critical mosquito density threshold of the vectorial capacity equation. An increase in epidemic potential indicates that a smaller number of mosquitoes can maintain a state of endemicity of disease where dengue virus is introduced. Baseline climate data for comparison are from 1931 to 1980. Among the three GCMs, the average projected temperature elevation was 1.16\u00b0C, expected by the year 2050. All three GCMs projected a temperature-related increase in potential seasonal transmission in five selected cities, as well as an increase in global epidemic potential, with the largest area change occurring in temperate regions. For regions already at risk, the aggregate epidemic potential across the three scenarios rose on average between 31 and 47% (range, 24-74%). If climate change occurs, as many climatologists believe, this will increase the epidemic potential of dengue-carrying mosquitoes, given viral introduction and susceptible human populations.

Impacts on fish populations from harmful marine microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates have been considered primarily from the limited view of acute or lethal influences. Accumulating evidence indicates that insidious sublethal and chronic impacts to both fish and human health from these organisms, such as long-term behavior alteration, increased susceptibility to cancers and other diseases, depressed feeding, and impaired reproduction, may be substantial and pervasive. For some harmful species, significant indirect impacts that promote critical habitat loss or disrupt the microbial food web balance also have been documented. Because successful models to predict the behavior and growth of most of these species have not yet been developed, and because toxins for many are poorly characterized, a clear anthropocentric focus has guided management strategies for confronting their outbreaks. The extent to which management takes the fundamental step of acknowledging scientifically demonstrated linkages among harmful microalgae, shellfish contamination, fish kills, and human health impacts has also been seriously constrained by political dictates stemming from economic considerations. Without federal involvement, and without catastrophe of human death or widescale serious human illness, little progress historically has been realized in the development of effective management strategies to mitigate lethal impacts to fish or other organisms. Many long-known taxa such as certain 'red tide' dinoflagellates apparently can increase independently of human influences other than physical transport. However, some newly discovered toxic or otherwise harmful taxa have been correlated with cultural eutrophication in poorly flushed fish nursery grounds such as estuaries and coastal waters. Outbreaks of certain warm-optimal species have coincided with El Nino events, suggesting that warming trends in global climate change may stimulate their growth and extend or shift their range. The available information points to a critical need for a more proactive, concerted effort to determine the full range of chronic/sublethal effects, as well as acute impacts, on marine fish populations by harmful marine microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, so that their increasingly important influence can be factored into reliable plans for sustainable fisheries management."], "title": "Implications of harmful microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates in management of sustainable marine fisheries"},

Reserve design and effectiveness can be dramatically improved by better use of existing scientific understanding. Reserves are insufficient protection alone, however, because they are not isolated from all critical impacts. Communities residing within marine reserves are strongly influenced by the highly variable conditions of the water masses that continuously flow through them. To a much greater degree than in terrestrial systems, the scales of fundamental processes, such as population replenishment, are often much larger than reserves can encompass. Further, they offer no protection from some important threats, such as contamination by chemicals.

An accurate representation of the sea-ice distribution (including ice extent, concentration and thickness) in climate models is therefore important for modelling global climate change.

Also, the observed high-latitude climate trends over the past few decades are much more regional and patchy than predicted by the models. As a first step in assessing possible climate impacts, model results are compared with observations of changes in temperature, precipitation, sea-ice extent, the permafrost regime and other cryospheric parameters. While considerable uncertainties remain in the long-term prediction of change, there is some agreement between model results and observed trends by season on shorter time-scales. The warming observed over the land masses of the Arctic over the past few decades is matched by corresponding observed decreases in snow cover and glacier mass balances, by thawing of the permafrost, and to a lesser degree by reductions in sea-ice extent. In Antarctica, warming in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions is associated with large decreases in ice-shelf areas and reduced ice thicknesses on the lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Major future impacts due to global greenhouse warming are likely to include permafrost thawing on land and its consequences for ecosystems and humans; changes in the productivity of marine ecosystems in the Arctic and Southern Oceans; economic impacts on fisheries, petroleum and other human activities; and social impacts on northern indigenous populations.

Sensitivity to the direct effects of climate change were evaluated using a climate-space approach to delineate the range of thermal conditions tolerable by each species. Sensitivity to indirect effects were evaluated by quantifying the association of each species to the current vegetation distribution within the continental USA and using this association to assess whether wildlife species distributions might shift in response to vegetation shifts under climate change. Results indicate that altered thermal conditions alone should have little or no effect on the wildlife species' distributions as physiological tolerance to heat load would allow them to survive. Analyses of the effects of vegetation change indicate that deer and chipmunks should retain their current distributions and possibly expand westward in the USA. For Elk and ground squirrels, there is a possibility that their current distributions would shrink and there is little possibility that each species would spread to new regions.

Through a close collaboration with breeding and cultivar development work, this research has helped to characterise and utilise better resistance for the management of anthracnose. Recently, a novel approach, using multivariate analysis, has been used to classify isolates into races taking into account the variation between pathogenicity assays. Both pathogenic and selection-neutral molecular markers have been used to reveal a limited range of variation in the Australian pathogen population compared with that at the centre of origin. This finding has important quarantine implications. The influence of weather factors in the dispersal, infection and survival of C. gloeosporioides has been established to characterise better the forms of genetic resistance which are prone to environmental variation. Evolutionary consequences of stylo genotype mixtures have been established to show that changes in race frequency can occur rapidly in the pathogen population, perhaps following changes in the composition of the host population due to outcrossing. As a model system, stylo anthracnose disease is being used to study the impact of predicted global climate change on plant diseases and the application of a 3-dimensional visual simulation model, 'virtual plant', to understand better the dynamics of disease and pest development within a plant canopy.

A low-pass Gaussian filtered time series of the annual sunspot number has been developed as a suitable proxy for solar magnetic activity that contains a long-term component related to the average level of activity as well as a short-term component related to the current phase of the 11-year cycle.

This irradiance variation is used as the variable radiative forcing function in a one-dimensional ocean-climate model, leading to a reconstruction of global temperatures over the same period, and to a suggestion that solar forcing and anthropogenic greenhouse-gas forcing made roughly equal contributions to the rise in global temperature that took place between 1900 and 1955.

Simulation studies of expected changes in species ranges and changes in ecosystem dynamics have indicated that rapidly changing climatic conditions could significantly thwart natural-area protection efforts at a global scale. In response to this potential threat, prescriptive policy and management recommendations have begun to emerge. These management responses include general guidelines for selecting new protected habitats, preemptive actions such as the development of connective corridor systems between protected areas, and active habitat management interventions. At present, many suggested natural-area management responses are only vaguely defined and have yet to be fully tested. To be effective, management responses must now be rigorously assessed with focused and practical ecological analysis. In this overview I examine the current state of research on the risks posed to natural-area protection bY climate change and the feasibility of suggested management responses. Examples of potential impacts on global nature-reserve systems, the composition of landscape boundaries of natural ecosystems, and latitudinal differences in expected ecosystem response are presented to illustrate the complexity of potential habitat changes. Examples of potential nature-reserve impacts are provided to demonstrate that the spatial variation presented in climate-change scenarios significantly affects the distribution of climatic impacts on areas of biodiversity protection. An assessment of the composition of landscape boundaries of natural vegetation areas is used to demonstrate the urgent need for analysis of ecosystem dynamics in human-dominated landscapes. Changes in potential vegetation zones at different latitudes are presented to identify limitations in the use of generic rules of altitudinal species response applied globally. Ecological researchers can advance our understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change by conducting well-defined sensitivity analyses at site-specific or sub-regional scales; the current lack of fine-scale climate models need not delay such research. Direct extrapolation of observed species distributions in relation to present climate as a means for projecting future responses is inappropriate; such projections must include consideration of physiological tolerances, competition, and dispersal mechanisms. Understanding local disturbance regimes is fundamental to understanding changes in ecosystem properties and stability. How landscape fragmentation interacts with population mobility and dynamics must be defined in order to better characterize ecosystem controls.

Correlations of control variables such as climatic factors and response variables such as vegetation and soil carbon storage across broad regions have played a crucial role in predicting the response of ecosystems to global climate change. Despite the importance of these large-scale space-for-time substitutions, there are substantial limitations. One of these limitations is that many of the possible control factors covary with one another, and only some of the important control factors actually exist in large-scale databases. Thus, the true proximal controls may be difficult to identify. A second limitation is that models of spatial variability may not be appropriately applied to temporal variability. In this paper, we utilize a new approach to determine the extent to which N availability may constrain aboveground primary productivity in the Central Grassland region of the U.S. The strong relationship between average annual primary production and average annual precipitation found in spatial patterns in ecosystems globally has often been interpreted as evidence of a fundamental water limitation. However, temporal variation in annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) indicates that other factors constrain production. We generated a spatial and temporal database for annual aboveground net primary production and annual net N mineralization by linking a database of input variables (precipitation, temperature, and soils) with predictive models. We generated independent data sets of aboveground net primary production and net N mineralization by using regression models to predict aboveground net primary production, and the Century model to simulate net N mineralization. Our analyses indicate that net primary production and net N mineralization both increase with mean annual precipitation; thus, it is not possible to separate the extent to which ANPP is controlled by water or N availability. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) increased with increasing precipitation across the region. Aboveground net primary production decreased with increasing temperature across the region, while N mineralization increased slightly, leading to decreasing (NUE) with increasing temperature. At high precipitation levels, aboveground net primary production increased and N mineralization decreased slightly with increasing soil fineness. Nitrogen use efficiency generally increased with increasing pools of soil organic matter, likely because in grasslands, the proportion of recalcitrant organic matter increases with the total organic matter pools. A comparison of interannual variation in net N mineralization with average spatial variation indicated a high degree of inertia in the response of N availability to precipitation levels. Our simulation results as well as field results of Lauenroth and Sala (1992) raise important questions about the applicability of space-for-time substitutions when dealing with ecosystem function. The structure of the systems appears to provide important constraints on the temporal variability that are not evident in an analysis of spatial variability."], "title": "Regional and temporal variation in net primary production and nitrogen mineralization in grasslands"},

The model simulates stand-level photosynthesis and N uptake by plants, allocation of C and N to foliage, stems, and fine roots, respiration in these tissues, turnover of biomass through litterfall, and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. We first calibrated the model by deriving a single parameter set that closely simulated the response of tussock tundra to decade-long experimental manipulations of nutrients, temperature, light, and atmospheric CO", ". The calibrated model predicts that historical increases in temperature and atmospheric CO", " have increased total ecosystem C storage. Higher temperatures increased soil and plant respiration, but those losses of C were overcompensated by increased photosynthesis resulting from redistribution of N from soil to plants. This redistribution of N was due to increased net mineralization and uptake of N. Increases in atmospheric CO", " also increased photosynthesis, but consequent increases in C storage were constrained by limits on increases in the C:N ratio of vegetation. In contrast, hypothesized historical decreases in soil moisture substantially decreased simulated total ecosystem C storage as a result of large increases in soil respiration. With decreased soil moisture, increases in photosynthesis associated with redistribution of N from soil to plants only partially compensated for respiratory C losses, as plant uptake of N could not keep pace with increased N mineralization rates. Consequent losses of N from the ecosystem contributed to the declines in C storage under drier conditions. Based on the combined effects of reconstructed historical changes in atmospheric CO", ", mean growing-season temperature, and two alternative soil moisture scenarios, the model predicts a -5.4 to +2.3% change in ecosystem C from-1829 to 1990. These estimates are consistent with field evidence that historically recent changes in C storage of tussock tundra have been relatively small. However, the model also predicts that relatively large transient losses of ecosystem C (50-180 g \u00b7 m", " \u00b7 yr", ") may frequently have occurred since the late 1800s, with one of the largest simulated C losses of the 20th century occurring from 1988 to 1990 (3-yr average = 133 g C \u00b7 m", " \u00b7 yr", "). These simulated losses were similar to losses measured in tussock tundra at Toolik Lake from 1983 to 1990 (e.g., 1990 losses = 156 g C \u00b7 m", " \u00b7 yr", ") but nonetheless suggest that these measured losses may be transitory in nature."], "title": "Reconstruction and analysis of historical changes in carbon storage in arctic tundra"},

In order to quantify these processes, we develop mathematical models for hydrate formation in porous media. An analytical model is derived for the idealized problem of hydrate growth in a porous half-space which is cooled on its boundary. Our calculations predict the growth rate of a hydrate layer for a given rate of cooling and show that the volume of hydrate is strongly dependent on the two-phase equilibrium between hydrate and seawater. For a representative phase diagram we find that the volume of hydrate in the layer is less than 1% of the pore volume. Larger volumes of hydrate observed in some locations demand a sustained supply of gas and a long accumulation time. Numerical calculations are used to investigate situations that are more representative of conditions in marine sediments. A simple theoretical expression is derived for the rate of hydrate accumulation due to advection of methane gas from depth. Using typical estimates of fluid velocities in accretionary environments, we obtain an accumulation rate of 1% of the pore volume in 10", " years.

The daily outflow of the catchment, which is dominated by spring snowmelt runoff, was simulated by the coupling of snowmelt and soil moisture accounting models of the US National Weather Service River Forecast System. Two threshold levels were used to define a flood day - the double and triple long-term mean daily streamflow - and the flood parameters (occurrences, duration, magnitude, etc.) for these cases were determined. Despite the complicated response of flood events to temperature increase and threshold, both hypothetical and monthly GISS representations of climate change resulted in more and longer flood events for climates with increased precipitation. All climates yielded larger flood volumes and greater mean values of flood peaks with respect to precipitation increase. The lower threshold resulted in more and longer flood occurrences, as well as smaller flood volumes and peaks than those of the upper one.

Paleosols in each member show a stepwise change in the degree of weathering of the most strongly developed paleosols: kaolinite-rich, Ultisol-like paleosols in lower \"Red Hill\" claystones (late Eocene, 42-43 Ma), smectite-rich Alfisol-like paleosols in the upper \"Red Hill\" claystones (late Eocene, 41-42 Ma), Alfisols and Ultisol-like paleosols in the lower Big Basin Member (late Eocene, 34-40 Ma), Alfisol and Inceptisol-like paleosols in the middle and upper Big Basin Members (early Oligocone, 30-34 Ma), and calcic Inceptisol-like paleosols in the lower Turtle Cove Member (middle Oligocone, 28-30 Ma). These changes across the Eocene-Oligocene transition are interpreted as representing global cooling and drying of the midlatitudes from Eocene subtropical, humid conditions to Oligocone temperate, subhumid conditions. In central Oregon, these changes appear to be stepwise with climatically stable periods, represented by packages of similar paleosols, of approximately 2-4 m.y. in duration. Our interpretation of these paleosol packages as non-marine sequences is not based on correlation with sea-level changes but on correlation with global climate change events. Geomorphic processes influenced by climate and vegetation, and not base-level change, basin subsidence, or volcanic supply are thought to have controlled sedimentation rates. Thus, the stepwise increase in sedimentation rates across the EoceneOligocene transition in the central Oregon alluvial strata reflect increased sediment yields due to drying climatic conditions. High-precision ", "Ar/ ", "Ar age determinations of tuffs allow for the correlation of these sequences with the record of global climate change from deep sea cores. Three major paleoclimatic changes stand out. The change from Ultisol-like paleosols formed in near-tropical climate to Alfisol-like paleosols formed in subtropical climate between 42.8 and 43 Ma corresponds to a global cooling trend after the mid-Eocene climatic optimum. The Eocene-Oligocene boundary (\u223c34 Ma) is marked by the change from subtropical Ultisol-like paleosols to Alfisol-like paleosols formed in temperate humid climate. Global cooling during the mid-Oligocene (\u223c30 Ma) is reflected in a change from noncalcareous, Alfisol-like paleosols to calcareous Andisol-like paleosols formed in sub-humid temperate conditions.

In our simulations, this forest vegetation warms the global climate by 2.2\u00b0C.

Agricultural ecosystems can play a significant role in production and consumption of greenhouse gases, specifically, carbon dioxide. Information is needed on the mechanism and magnitude of gas generation and emission from agricultural soils with specific emphasis on tillage mechanisms. This work evaluated four different tillage methods on the short-term CCh and water vapor flux from a clay loam soil in the Northern Cornbelt of the USA. The four tillage methods were moldboard plow only, moldboard plow plus disk harrow twice, disk harrow and chisel plow using standard tillage equipment following a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop compared with no tillage. The CO", " flux was measured with a large portable chamber commonly used to measure crop canopy gas exchange initiated within 5 minutes after tillage and continued intermittently for 19 days. The moldboard plow treatment buried nearly all of the residue and left the soil in a rough, loose, open condition and resulted in maximum CO", " loss. The carbon released as CCh during the 19 days following the moldboard plow, moldboard plow plus disk harrow, disk harrow, chisel plow and not tilled treatments would account for 134%, 70%, 58%, 54% and 27% respectively of the carbon in the current year's crop residue. The short-term carbon dioxide losses 5 hours after four conservation tillage tools was only 31% of that of the moldboard plow. The moldboard plow lost 13.8 times as much CO", " as the soil area not tilled while different conservation tillage tools lost only 4.3 times. The smaller CO", " loss following conservation tillage tools is significant and suggests progress in developing conservation tillage tools that can enhance soil carbon management. Conservation tillage reduces the extent, frequency and magnitude of mechanical disturbance caused by the moldboard plow and reduces the air-filled macropores and slows the rate of carbon oxidation.

MIGRATE uses biological parameters that readily may be estimated from data in the literature or from field studies, and represents the landscape as a grid of cells, each with an associated carrying capacity. A one-dimensional version of MIGRATE has been compared both with Skellam's (1951) diffusion model and with the more recent analytical models of van den Bosch et al.

An example is described that demonstrates the ability of the two-dimensional version of MIGRATE to simulate the likely pattern of spread of a species across a heterogenous landscape. It is argued that MIGRATE, or models like it, will play a central role in a spatially-hierarchic modelling strategy that must be developed if we are to achieve the goal of simulating the likely response of trees, and other organisms, to both global climate change and the increasing pressures of human land-use."], "title": "The migration of sessile organisms: A simulation model with measurable parameters"},

Global climate change may interact with anthropogenic processes to create additional impacts on coral diversity in the near future. In order to predict these changes, it is necessary to understand the magnitude and causes of variation in scleractinian coral diversity throughout their 240 million year history. The fossil record documents long periods of speciation in corals, interrupted repeatedly by events of mass extinction. Some of these events relate clearly to changes in global climate. Diversity in reef corals has increased since their last period of extinction at the end of the Cretaceous (65 My BP), and is still rising. During the last 8 million years, the fragmentation of the once pantropical Tethys Sea separated corals into two major biogeographical provinces. Periods of glaciation also have caused major changes in sea level and temperature. Accumulated evidence supports the theory that relative habitat area and changing patterns of oceanic circulation are mainly responsible for the two observed centres of recent coral diversity at the western tropical margins of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. At predicted rates of climate change in the near future, coral reefs are likely to survive as an ecosystem. Increases in sea level may actually benefit corals and lead to regional increases in diversity if new habitat area on back reefs is opened to increased water circulation and thus coral dispersal. Rising temperature may cause higher rates of coral mortality and even local extinction in isolated, small populations such as those on oceanic islands. The effects of increases in ultraviolet radiation (UV) are largely unknown, but likely to be negative. UV may damage planktonic coral propagules in oceanic surface waters and thus decrease rates of gene flow between coral populations. This may result in increased local extinctions, again with the strongest impact on widely separated reefs with small coral populations. The largest threats to coral diversity are regional anthropogenic impacts, which may interact with global climate change to exacerbate rates of local species extinctions. Centres of high reef coral diversity coincide with human population centres in south-east Asia and the Caribbean, and thus the greatest potential for species loss lies in these geographical areas. \u00a9 1996 Blackwell Science Ltd."], "title": "Reef coral diversity and global change"},

Furthermore, problems arising from variability of water availability and soil degradation are currently major challenges to agriculture in the region. These problems may be exacerbated in the future if global climate change projections are realized. Many studies have considered strategies for improving agricultural management, based on the optimization of crop management decisions.

While it is likely that extended periods of directional climate change would bring about an altitudinal shift in the ranges of montane species and the associated ecotones, we question whether the response at either ecotone will be at a timescale useful for detecting climate change (a few decades) owing to disequilibrium related to upslope edaphic limitations and competitive interactions with established canopy and subcanopy individuals.

Forest floor carbon pools and fluxes were evaluated at 16 northern hardwood sites located within four distinct climate regions (Northern, Central, Southern and Coastal) in Maine. Mean annual air temperature at the sites ranged from 2.0\u00b0C in the Northern region to 6.2\u00b0C in the Coastal region and average annual precipitation ranged from 90 cm in the Northern region to 140 cm in the Coastal region. Leaf litter mass and leaf litter C flux were not correlated with temperature indices and did not vary among regions. However, they were positively correlated with annual precipitation, suggesting that litter production was controlled, in part at least, by precipitation but not by temperature. Northern sites stored more C in the forest floor than Coastal sites, and they experienced slower decomposition rates. Because soil and vegetation characteristics of these sites were similar, we attribute these trends to differences in climate. Indeed, C turnover time was correlated with latitude and temperature indices. Slower decomposition in the Northern region was attributed to a combination of lower specific activity at temperatures below 13\u00b0C, cooler average temperatures and a shorter frost-free season. Soil respiration at each site was positively correlated with temperature and the slope of the relationship increased with latitude, indicating that the ability of the soil biota to respire C varied with climate. A predictive equation is presented that accounts for the change in slope with latitude. Because C loss through soil respiration was more sensitive to temperature than C inputs from litter, any regional warming in the next century may lead to a decrease in forest floor carbon storage.

One major consequence predicted by global climate change scenarios is an intensification of monosoonal (summer) precipitation in the aridland areas of the western United States. We examined the capacity of dominant perennial shrubs in a Colorado Plateau cold desert ecosystem of southern Utah, United States, to use summer moisture inputs. We simulated increases of 25 and 50 mm summer rain events on Atriplex canescens, Artemisia filifolia, Chrysothamnus nauseosus, Coleogyne ramosissima, and Vanclevea stylosa, in July and September with an isotopically enriched water (enriched in deuterium but not ", "O). The uptake of this artificial water source was estimated by analyzing hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of stem water. The predawn and midday xylem water potentials and foliar carbon isotope discrimination were measured to estimate changes in water status and water-use efficiency. At. canescens and Ch. nauseosus showed little if any uptake of summer rains in either July or September. The predawn and midday xylem water potentials for control and treatment plants of these two species were not significantly different from each other. For A. filifolia and V. stylosa, up to 50% of xylem water was from the simulated summer rain, but the predawn and midday xylem water potentials were not significantly affected by the additional summer moisture input. In contrast, C. ramosissima showed significant uptake of the simulated summer rain (>50% of xylem water was from the artificial summer rain) and an increase in both predawn and midday water potentials. The percent uptake of simulated summer rain was greater when those rains were applied in September than in July, implying that high soil temperature in midsummer may in some way inhibit water uptake. Foliar carbon isotope discrimination increased significantly in the three shrubs taking up simulated summer rain, but pre-treatment differences in the absolute discrimination values were maintained among species.

The corresponding relative humidity is kept constant, which results in an increase of atmospheric moisture. We find that in the winter season precipitation increases consistently with the SCC approach, with a significant dependence on topographical elevation. Other components of the surface energy and water budgets also show a marked elevation dependency, mostly tied to changes in snow cover. In summer, contrary to what might be expected from the SCC forcing, precipitation decreases over the Alpine mountain chain. This is due to a local surface-atmosphere feedback mechanism involving reduced snow cover and soil moisture at the beginning of summer. Our results suggest that over the Alps during summer local feedbacks related to the surface energy and water budgets are important factors in determining the precipitation response to global warming.

This is the primary cause of the climatic constraints observed in the zone, such as low temperatures, a short growing season, frosts during the growing season, long and cold winters and thick snow cover. In Finland, the length of the growing season varies from 180 days in the south (60\u00b0N) to 120 days in the north (70\u00b0N). Consequently, the growing time for crops from sowing to ripening is also short, which limits their ability to produce high yields. The most advanced forms of farming in the high-latitude zone are encountered towards the south in Northern Europe, central Siberia and the prairies of Canada, i.e. mainly in the phytogeographical hemiboreal zone where the effective temperature sum is higher than 1200\u00b0Cd. Conditions for agriculture then deteriorate gradually further north with the cooling of the climate, and this is reflected as an increase in cattle rearing at the expense of grain cultivation. In northern Europe farming is practised as far north as to the Arctic Circle, at about 66\u00b0N latitude. In North America, fields extend to about 55\u00b0N. In Asia, there are few fields north of 60\u00b0N.

For this purpose a model for climate assessment, named ESCAPE, is coupled to a water balance model, named RHINEFLOW. From climate scenarios, changes in regional annual water availability and seasonal discharge in the River Rhine Basin are estimated. The climate scenarios are based on greenhouse gases emissions scenarios. An assessment is made for 'best guess' seasonal discharge changes and for changes in frequencies of low and high discharges in the downstream reaches of the river. In addition, a quantitative estimation of the uncertainties associated with this guess is arrived at. The results show that the extent and range of uncertainty is large with respect to the 'best guess' changes. The uncertainty range is 2-3 times larger for the Business-as-Usual than for the Accelerated Policies scenarios. This large range stems from the doubtful precipitation simulations from the present General Circulation Models. This scenario study showed the precipitation scenarios to be the key-elements within the present range of reliable climate change scenarios. For the River Rhine 'best guess' changes for annual water availability are small according to both scenarios. The river changes from a present combined snow-melt-rain fed river to an almost entirely rain fed river. The difference between present-day large average discharge in winter and the small average discharge in autumn should increase for all scenarios. This trend is largest in the Alpine part of the basin. Here, winter discharges should increase even for scenarios forecasting annual precipitation decreases. Summer discharge should decrease. 'Best guess' scenarios should lead to increased frequencies of both low and high flow events in the downstream (Dutch) part of the river. The results indicate changes could be larger than presently assumed in 'worst case scenarios' used by the Dutch water management authorities. \u00a9 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers."], "title": "The impact of climate change on the river rhine: A scenario study"},

The package allows the sophisticated control of the simulation processes for photosynthesis through a standardized Windows user interface and provides automatically formatted results as either tabulated data or as a range of customizable graphs. WIMOVAC has been written in Microsoft Visual Basic, to facilitate the rapid development of user-friendly modules within the familiar Windows framework, while allowing a structured development.

We conclude that the observed changes of the diurnal cycle result neither from natural climate variability nor a globally-distributed forcing, but rather they require the combination of a (negative) radiative forcing located primarily over continental regions together with the known globally-distributed forcing due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Tropospheric aerosols can account for part of the continentally-located forcing, but alone they do not damp the diurnal cycle as observed. Only an increase of continental cloud cover, possibly a consequence of anthropogenic aerosols, can damp the diurnal cycle by an amount comparable to observations. A corollary of these results is quantitative confirmation of the widely held suspicion that anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming has been substantially counterbalanced by a forced cooling. Under the assumption that the cloud change is sulfate driven, a further implication is that the net rate of global warming is likely to increase substantially in coming years.

Foliar and reproductive phenology in broadleaf deciduous trees of the temperate zone are only weakly coupled within a growing season, especially in precocious flowering trees that mature their fruits in early summer. In species that fruit in late summer and fall, leaf emergence and flowering can be entrained by shared responses to the progressive warming of early spring but with only limited effect on the timing of fruit maturation. The timing of foliar senescence and fruit maturation is correlated only in fall-fruiting trees but as a common response to fall climate rather than the outcome of foliar retranslocation of resources to developing fruits.

Three sites were selected:Tur\u00e9n, Barinas and Yaritagua, representing two important agricultural regions in the country. The CERES-Maize model, a mechanistic process-based model, in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used for the crop simulations. These simulations assume non-limiting nutrients, no pest damage and no damage from excess water; therefore, the results indicate only the difference between baseline and perturbed climatic conditions, when other conditions remain the same. Four greenhouse-induced global climate change scenarios, covering different sensitivity levels, and one deforestation-induced regional climate change scenario were used. The greenhouse scenarios assume increased air temperature, increased rainfall and decreased incoming solar radiation, as derived from atmospheric GCMs for doubled CO", " conditions. The deforestation scenarios assume increased air temperature, increased incoming solar radiation and decreased rainfall, as predicted by coupled atmosphere-biosphere models for extensive deforestation of a portion of the Amazon basin. Two baseline climate years for each site were selected, one year with average precipitation and another with lower than average rainfall. Scenarios associated with the greenhouse effect cause a decrease in yield of both cultivars at all three sites, while the deforestation scenarios produce small changes. Sensitivity tests revealed the reasons for these responses. Increasing temperatures, especially daily maximum temperatures, reduce yield by reducing the duration of the phenological phases of both cultivars, as expected from CERES-Maize. The reduction of the duration of the kernel filling phase has the largest effect on yield. Increases of precipitation associated with greenhouse warming have no effects on yield, because these sites already have adequate precipitation; however, the crop model used here does not simulate potential negative effects of excess water, which could have important consequences in terms of soil erosion and nutrient leaching. Increases in solar radiation increased yields, according to the non-saturating light response of the photosynthesis rate of a C", " plant like corn, compensating for reduced yields from increased temperatures in deforestation scenarios.

Over the years, under field conditions, various trace gas-vegetation exposure methodologies with differing advantages and disadvantages have been used. Because of these variable criteria, with elevated O", " or CO", " levels, at the present time the approach of free-air experimental-release of the gas into study plots is attracting much attention. However, in the case of CO", ", this approach (using 15 m diameter study plot with a single circular array of vent pipes) has proven to be cost prohibitive (about $59000-98000/year/replicate) due to the consumption of significant quantities of the gas to perform the experiment (CO", " level elevated to 400 ppm above the ambient). Therefore, in this paper, we present a new approach consisting of a dual, concentric exposure array of vertical risers or vent pipes. The purpose of the outer array (17 m diameter) is to vent ambient air outward and toward the incoming wind, thus providing an air curtain to reduce the velocity of that incoming wind to simulate the mode or the most frequently occurring wind speed at the study site. The inner array (15 m diameter) vents the required elevated levels of trace gases (CO", ", O", ", etc.) into the study plot.

Whilst the Japanese-based mangrove wood-chips industry continues in its destructive path through the larger mangrove ecosystems of the region, the focus of mangrove destruction has shifted to the conversion of mangrove areas into aquaculture ponds and the consequences of the unprecedented massive addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by post industrial man. Mangroves are non-homogeneous; characterised by distinct vegetative zones that occupy the interface between land and sea and dynamically interacting with the atmosphere above as well as with the influences of the adjacent land and sea. The conservation of mangroves should thus include not only the various vegetation and tidal inundation zones but also the adjacent marine and terrestrial areas (including the water catchment area). On the current concern with global climate change, it is pointed out that relative sea level change is very much site dependent. For effective planning and management, it is vital to know if a particular site is stable, rising or sinking so efforts should be directed to find suitable methods for determining this. However, should rapid relative sea level rise take place, there is very little likelihood of saving mangroves whose landward margins have been developed by man, a fact to bear in mind when selecting sites for conservation. The Matang mangroves of Malaysia is rare case of successful sustainable management of a tropical rain forest. Although the tools of management are available they are not widely applied.

They are water-filled vertical openings in the carbonate rock that exhibit complex morphologies, ecologies, and water chemistries.

Blue holes are polygenetic in origin, having formed: by drowning of dissolutional sinkholes and shafts developed in the vadose zone; by phreatic dissolution along an ascending halocline; by progradational collapse upward from deep dissolution voids produced in the phreatic zone; or by fracture of the bank margin. Blue holes are the cumulative result of carbonate deposition and dissolution cycles which have been controlled by Quaternary glacioeustatic fluctuations of sea-level. Blue holes have been widely studied during the past 30 years, and they have provided information regarding karst processes, global climate change, marine ecology, and carbonate geochemistry. The literature contains a wealth of references regarding blue holes that are at times misleading, and often confusing. To standardize use of the term blue hole, and to familiarize the scientific community with their nature, we herein define them as follows: \"Blue holes are subsurface voids that are developed in carbonate banks and islands; are open to the earth's surface; contain tidally-influenced waters of fresh, marine, or mixed chemistry; extend below sea level for a majority of their depth; and may provide access to submerged cave passages.\" Blue holes are found in two settings: ocean holes open directly into the present marine environment and usually contain marine water with tidal flow; inland blue holes are isolated by present topography from surface marine conditions, and open directly onto the land surface or into an isolated pond or lake, and contain tidally-influenced water of a variety of chemistries from fresh to marine. \u00a9 1995 Springer."], "title": "Blue holes: Definition and genesis"},

Because subtidal and offshore coastal marine communities are not easily observed, their deterioration often goes mostly unnoticed. Impacts from stresses on coastal marine communities are manifested at the individual species level, but magnify in effect throughout the entire ecosystem because of complex inter-connected relationships between species at different trophic levels, including interactions such as predation, competition and mutualism. Therefore, one lost species or group of species may have unpredictable direct or indirect consequences through secondary effects on the ecosystem, possibly leading to the loss of a few to many species. Rather than striving to maintain some specific level of diversity, we should endeavour to understand the basic ecological proceses that control populations, communities and ecosystems so we can best predict what kinds of stresses will cause the most serious alterations to the system and avoid them. We should be conservative about protecting systems even before we understand the procesess fully. -from Author"], "title": "Temperate coastal marine communities: biodiversity and threats"},

Because fossil fuels remain the driving force of modern economies, any economic growth in the developed or developing countries results in an increased emission of carbon dioxide. Consequently, reduction of carbon dioxide emissions has become an important issue. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that a worldwide reduction of the emission of green house gases by more that 60% is necessary to avert the global climate change.

For simple storage, simulation studies to determine the capacity of a given reservoir are conducted for different reservoirs with a wide range of governing parameters. Major parameters studied are: initial reservoir pressure, final average reservoir pressure, impurities in the injected gas, petrophysical properties of the reservoir, and initial fluid saturations. For the utilization, simulation studies are carried out for both miscible and immiscible flooding enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. It is difficult to maintain carbon dioxide miscibility in a reservoir.
