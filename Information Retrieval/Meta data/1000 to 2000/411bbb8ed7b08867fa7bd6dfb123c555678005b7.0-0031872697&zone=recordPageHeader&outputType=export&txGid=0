Market forces alone are unlikely to change transportation-energy technologies and infrastructures sufficiently to address the needs for an environmentally sustainable system. A set of policies for encouraging technological advances and promoting sustainable planning, operations, and pricing of transportation services was analysed for its effects on sector energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Baseline projections show US transport sector GHG emissions increasing over the 1990 level 28% by 2010 and 58% by 2030. The combined impacts of the policies analysed would be substantial emission reductions that grow over time, with GHG emissions returned to the 1990 level by 2010 and cut to 35% lower by 2030. Due to fuel savings from technology-based efficiency improvements, it was found that the economic benefits accruing from these reductions would outpace costs almost from the outset.",,"climate change; climate policy; emissions control; greenhouse gas; transport energy",,,,,,"Heavenrich, Hellman, (1996) Cited in Caption, , but not list; (1991) America's Energy Choices: Investing in a Strong Economy and a Clean Environment Report by the Alliance to Save Energy, , AEC American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Union of Concerned Scientists, Cambridge, MA; Alson, J., German, J., Gold, K., Larson, R., Wolcott, M., (1996) Transportation Energy Demand Models: Why They Underestimate Greenhouse Gas Emissions Paper Presented at the Climate Change Analysis Workshop, , Springfield, VA, June 6-7, 1996 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC; Archer, L.J., (1993) Aircraft Emissions and the Environment: COx SOx HOx & NOx, , Oxford, UK: Oxford Institute for Energy Studies; Cannon, J.S., (1995) Harnessing Hydrogen: The Key to Sustainable Transportation Inform, , Inc, New York; Carlson, D., Wormser, L., Ulberg, C., (1995) At Road's End: Transportation and Land Use Choices for Communities, , Washington, DC: Island Press; Cataldi, D.L., 'Integrating Steel Wheels into Sustainable Transportation' (1997) Presented at the Conference on Sustainable Transportation Energy Strategies, , Asilomar, CA, August 1995.
