Transient climate change simulations of a coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM (ECHAM4/OPYC3) project a change towards enhanced ENSO activities in the tropical Pacific, as well as increase in mean monsoon rainfall and variability over India. However, the interannual correlations between the two are strong throughout the 240 year simulation. Analysis of monsoon viz-a-viz ENSO in the model simulations suggest a diminished impact of warm ENSO (El Niño) events on monsoon, while the impact of cold ENSO (La Niña) events remains unchanged in the scenario. Anomalous warming over the Eurasian landmass as well as enhanced moisture conditions over the Indian monsoon region in the global warming scenario have possibly contributed to the weakening of the impact of warm ENSO events on monsoon.",,"Computer simulation; Global warming; Rain; Transient climate changes; Greenhouse effect; air-sea interaction; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate change; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; greenhouse effect; monsoon",,,,,,"Bhaskaran, B., Mitchell, J.F.B., Lavery, J.R., Lal, M., Climatic response of Indian subcontinent to doubled CO2 concentration (1995) Int.
