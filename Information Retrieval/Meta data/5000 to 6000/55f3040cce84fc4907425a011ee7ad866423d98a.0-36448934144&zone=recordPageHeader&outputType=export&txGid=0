The results indicate that external forcing plays an important role in the evolution of the land surface air temperature on interannual, decadal, and interdecadal time scales, and contributes greatly to the global warming in the following two periods: the early twentieth century between the 1910s and the 1940s and the late twentieth century after the 1970s. External forcing also has strong impact on the regional temperature change during the two warming periods except for parts of the Eurasia and the North America continents. In the cooling period, however, the impact of internal variability is dominant. © 2007 Science in China Press.","Climate simulation; External forcing; Global warming",,,,,,,"Zhou, T.J., Yu, R.C., Wang, Z.Z., (2005) The Atmospheric General Circulation Model SAMIL and Its Associated Coupled Model FGOALS_s (In Chinese), p. 288. , Meteorological Press Beijing; Stott, P.A., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, G.S., External control of 20th century temperature by natural and anthropogenic forcing (2000) Science, 290, pp. 2133-2137; Tett, S.F.B., Stott, P.A., Allen, M.A., Causes for twentieth century temperature change (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 569-572; Meehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Wigley, T.M.L., Solar and greenhouse gas forcing and climate response in the twentieth century (2003) J Climate, 16, pp. 426-444; Zhou, T.J., Yu, R.C., Twentieth-century surface air temperature over China and the globe simulated by coupled climate models (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 5843-5858; Delworth, T.L., Knutson, T.R., Simulation of early 20th century global warming (2000) Science, 287, pp. 2246-2250; Natalia, G.A., Michael, E.S., Causes of global temperature changes during the 19th and 20th centuries (2000) Geophys Res Lett, 27, pp. 2137-2140. , 14; Folland, C.K., Shukla, J., Kinter, J., C20C: The Climate of the Twentieth Century Project (2002) CLIVAR Exchanges, 7, pp. 37-39. , 2; Wang, B., Wan, H., Ji, Z.Z., Design of a new dynamical core for global atmospheric models based on some efficient numerical methods (2004) Sci China ser A-Math Sci, 47, pp. 4-21. , Suppl; Li, L.J., Wang, B., Wang, Y.Q., Improvements in Climate Simulation with Modifications to the Tiedtke Convective Parameterization in the Grid-point Atmospheric Model of IAP LASG (GAMIL) (2007) Adv Atmos Sci, 24, pp. 323-335; Collins, W.D., Hack, J.J., Boville, B.A., Description of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM2) (2003) NCAR Technical Notes; Dai, Y.J., Zeng, X., Dickinson, R.E., The Common Land Model (CLM) (2003) B Am Meteorol Soc, 84, pp. 1013-1023; Rayner, N.A., Parker, D.E., Horton, E.B., Global analyses of sea surface temperature, sea ice, and night marine air temperature since the late nineteenth century (2003) J Geop Res, 108, p. 4407. , 14; Lean, J., Beer, J., Bradley, R., Reconstruction of solar irradiance since 1610: Implications for climate change (1995) Geophys Res Lett, 22, pp. 3195-3198. , 23; Boucher, O., Pham, M., History of sulfate aerosol radiative forcings (2002) Geophys Res Lett, 29, p. 1308. , 9; Brohan, P., Kennedy, J.J., Haris, I., Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: A new dataset from 1850 (2006) J Geop Res, 111, p. 12106; Mitchell, T.D., Jones, P.D., An improved method of constructing a database of monthly climate observations and associated high-resolution grids (2005) Int J Climatology, 25, pp. 693-712; Gong, D.Y., Wang, S.W., The warmest year on record of the century in China (1998) Meteorology (In Chinese), 25, pp. 1-3. , 8","Li, L.; LASG, Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China; email: ljli@mail.iap.ac.cn",,,,,,,,10016538,,CSBUE,,"English","Chin.
