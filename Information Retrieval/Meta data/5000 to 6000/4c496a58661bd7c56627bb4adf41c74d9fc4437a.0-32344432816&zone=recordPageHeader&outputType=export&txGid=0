Degradation of organic waste produces CH4 and other landfill gases that significantly contribute to global warming. However, before entering the atmosphere, part of the produced CH4 can be oxidised while passing through the landfill cover. In the present study, the oxidation rate of CH4 was studied with various types of compost as possible landfill cover. The influence of incubation time, moisture content and temperature on the CH4 oxidation capacity of different types of compost was examined. It was observed that the influence of moisture content and temperature on methane oxidation is time-dependent. Maximum oxidation rates were observed at moisture contents ranging from 45% to 110% (dry weight basis), while the optimum temperature ranged from 15 to 30°C. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
