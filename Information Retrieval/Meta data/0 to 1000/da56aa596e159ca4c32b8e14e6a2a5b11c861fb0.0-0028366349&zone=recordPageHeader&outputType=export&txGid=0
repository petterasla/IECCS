Predictions show that CO2 emissions will almost double in the next twenty years. The equivalent potential CO2 emissions from nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), for a time horizon of 20 years, is also presented. NOx and VOC emissions seem to make a significant contribution to the global warming potential of Portuguese emissions. Estimates of CO2 emissions due to forest fires have been made, oriented towards the study of the Portuguese contribution to the global warming. If the burned area exceeds 100 000 ha this contribution could reach 7% of the total Portuguese CO2 emissions. The global warming potential of Portuguese forest emissions were also calculated. The climate change predicted to Portugal could be responsible for an increase in the forest fires and consequently for a greater contribution of its emissions to the total values. It was concluded that it is important to quantify emissions of the greenhouse gases, including the contribution of forest fire emissions, not only in Portugal, but in all the Southern European countries. © 1993.","emission factors; emission trends; forest fires; global warming; greenhouse gases","carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxide; volatile organic compound; climate; conference paper; fire; forest; greenhouse effect; portugal; prediction; time",,,,,,"Borrego, Santana, Duarte, Santos, Ramalho, (1991) Livro branco sobre o estado do ambiente em Portugal, , Ministério do Ambiente e Recursos Naturais; Carneiro, Neves, Vasconcelos, (1991) Projecto CORINE AR: inventário das emissões de poluentes atmosféricos—uma metodologia, aplicação a 1985, , DGQA; Coutinho, Miranda, Borrego, Rua, Emission trends in Portugal: a global perspective (1992) 85th Annual Meeting and Exhibition, , 21–26 June, Kansas City, Presented at the; EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), (1977) Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, , Third edition, EPA Research, Triangle Park, NC; IPCC, (1990) IPCC First Assessment Report.
