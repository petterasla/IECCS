To mitigate the effect of atmospheric CO2, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been found to be an important tool. The present study aims at explaining the role of soils as one of the most important natural resources in enhancing CCS. Soils capture and store both organic and inorganic forms of carbon and thus act both as source and sink for atmospheric CO2. The datasets developed on CCS of soils permit us to generate thematic maps on soil carbon stocks, which may serve as ready reckoners for planners in prioritizing C sequestration programmes.","Capture; Carbon stock; Sequestration; Soils; Storage capacity",,,,,,,"(2007) Carbon capture and geological storage, , http://www.naturalsciencesbe/pss_css/Public/carboncapture, Anon; Goel, M., Carbon capture and storage technology for sustainable energy future (2007) Curr.
