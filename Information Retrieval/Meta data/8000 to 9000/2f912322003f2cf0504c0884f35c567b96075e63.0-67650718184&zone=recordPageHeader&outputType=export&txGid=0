Methods A multi-phase Richards model was fitted to weekly cumulative dengue data to pinpoint the turning points of the outbreak. We obtained the 'initial' reproduction numbers for the two waves of the outbreak. By means of correlation analysis we explored the possible impact of climatological events on the occurrence of turning points. Results Three turning points occurred around early August, late August/early September, and late October/early November. The 'initial' reproduction number for the first wave was Ri = 4.67 (95% CI: 0*-10.92), where 0* = max0, lower bound, and Ri = 3.93 (95% CI: 1.74-6.13) for the second wave. The highest correlation was between dengue incidence and two climatological variables: maximum temperature at a lag of 5 weeks (r = 0.66 and 0.71) and total precipitation at a lag of seven weeks (r = 0.53). Conclusions The first two turning points were partially attributable to two typhoons around early to mid-August that brought a sharp drop in temperature and substantial rainfall. The drop in temperature first drove the dengue incidence down, then the rainfall drove it up at the beginning of fall. In recent years, Taiwan has witnessed increasingly frequent large summer dengue outbreaks that persisted into early winter, perhaps due to warmer autumns. This highlights the possible impact of global warming on the spread of infectious diseases. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Dengue; Global warming; Intervention measure; Reproduction number; Richards model; Taiwan; Turning point","rain; climate change; climate effect; dengue fever; disease spread; global warming; infectious disease; modeling; reproduction; seasonal variation; article; autumn; climate change; dengue; environmental temperature; epidemic; greenhouse effect; human; hurricane; incidence; major clinical study; statistical model; Taiwan; winter; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Incidence; Models, Biological; Rain; Seasons; Taiwan; Temperature; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Taiwan",,,,,,"Ang, L.W., Foong, B.H., Ye, T., Chow, A., Chew, S.K., Impact of ""carpet-combing"" vector control operations in terminating the 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore (2007) Epidemiological News Bulletin, 33, pp. 31-36; Bailey, N.T.J., (1982) The Biomathematics of Malaria., , Griffin.
