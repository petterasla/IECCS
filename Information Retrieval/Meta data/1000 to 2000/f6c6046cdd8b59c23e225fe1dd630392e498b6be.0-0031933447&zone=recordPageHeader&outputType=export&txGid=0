M1C 1A4, Canada","The potential impact of global warming on sea-level rise in the Hudson Bay area was examined. Land-based ice melt and thermal expansion of ocean waters were compared to isostatic rebound rates. Thermal expansion was estimated using a one-dimensional analysis and a three-dimensional world ocean general circulation model. It was found that the combined impact on sea-level rise of land-based ice melt and thermal expansion of the world ocean was the same order of magnitude as the sea-level fall rates due to isostatic rebound. Thus, there is the possibility of a cessation or reversal of sea-level fall in the Hudson Bay area in the next 100 yr.",,"climate change; global warming; ice melt; sea level rise; Canada, Hudson Bay; Canada, James Bay",,,,,,"Beckmann, L., Marine conservation in the Canadian Arctic (1994) Northern Perpectives, 22, pp. 33-39; Church, J.A., Godfrey, S., Jackett, D., McDougall, T., A model of sea level rise caused by ocean thermal expansion (1990) Journal of Climate, 4, pp. 438-456; Cubasch, U., Hasselmann, K., Hock, H., Maier-Reimer, E., Mikolajewicz, U., Santer, B., Sausen, R., Time-dependent greenhouse warming computations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model (1992) Climate Dynamics, 8, pp. 55-69; Gornitz, V., Lebedeff, L., Hansen, J., Global sea level trend in the last century (1982) Science, 215, pp. 1611-1614; Gough, W., Lin, C., The response of an ocean general circulation model to long time-scale surface temperature anomalies (1992) Atmosphere-Ocean, 30, pp. 653-674; Hasselmann, K., Sausen, R., Maier-Reimer, E., Voss, R., On the cold start problem in transient simulations with coupled ocean-atmosphere models (1993) Climate Dynamics, 9, pp. 53-61; Haney, R., Surface boundary conditions for ocean general circulation models (1971) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 1, pp. 241-248; Jones, G., Global warming, sea level and the impacts on estuaries (1994) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 30, pp. 7-13; Leblond, P., Mysak, L., (1978) Waves in the Ocean, , Oxford: Elsevier Scientific Publishing. 602 pp; Maier-Reimer, E., Hasselmann, K., Mikolajewicz, U., The Hamburg large-scale geostrophic ocean general circulation model (1990) Technical Report Deutsch KlimaRechenZentrum, , 34 pp; Maier-Reimer, E., Mikolajewicz, U., Hasselmann, K., Mean circulation of the Hamburg LSG OGCM and its sensitivity to the thermohaline surface forcing (1993) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 23, pp. 731-757; Manabe, S., Bryan, K., CO2-induced change in a couple ocean-atmosphere model and its paleoclimatic implications (1985) Journal of Geophysical Research, 90, pp. 11689-111207; Mikolajewicz, U., Maier-Reimer, E., Internal secular variability in an OGCM (1990) Climate Dynamics, 4, pp. 145-156; Mikolajewicz, U., Santer, B., Maier-Reimer, E., Ocean response to greenhouse warming (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 589-593; Mitrovica, J., Davis, J., Shapiro, I., A spectral formulation for computing three dimensional deformations due to surface loads. 2.
