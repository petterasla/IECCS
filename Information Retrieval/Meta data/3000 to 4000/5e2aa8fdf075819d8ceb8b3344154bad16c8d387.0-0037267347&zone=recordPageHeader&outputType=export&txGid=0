Brunei Darussalam has three gas-fired power plants using approximately 3.106 m3/day gas and emitting substantial flue gases into the atmosphere. After desulphurisation with sea water, carbon-dioxide, the gas primarily associated with global warming and the main constituent of flue gas, can be dissolved under pressure in seawater and injected into the sea at suitable depth. The injected solution constitutes a negatively buoyant plume in the sea, carried by currents to deeper regions. It has been noted that the solution mixes and reacts with other oceanic components and converts to carbonates and sulphates that can remain near the bottom for several hundreds of years. Until a better alternative is developed, this may be an immediate solution to the problem of dealing with flue gases. The feasibility and economics of this alternative have been discussed in the literature. For optimal design criteria for such disposal, numerous parameters (such as location, pipe diameter, type of diffuser, angles of discharge, etc.) are involved in the mathematical analysis. Many alternative sets of these parameters must be used as input parameters to arrive at final design parameters for optimal results.","Carbon dioxide; Concentration; Dilution; Effluent; Flue gas disposal; Mathematical and computer models; Solubility","atmospheric pollution; emission; flue gas; power plant; atmospheric pollution; industrial emission; modeling; power plant; Brunei Darussalam",,,,,,"Abrams, J.Z., Zaczek, S.J., Benz, A.D., Awerbuch, L., Use of seawater in sea-water desulphurisation (1988) J.
