A 200 Hz giant magnetostrictive source was developed to increase the transmitting level and decrease the source size. Five 200 Hz transceiver systems were constructed with these sources. These systems have surface buoys for real-time data transmission via the INMARSAT-C. Sea tests of the five transceiver systems were conducted east of the Izu-Ogasawara Trench to observe the Kuroshio Extension during July and September 1997.","Giant magnetostrictive source; Global climate change; Ocean acoustic tomography; Real-time observation of ocean phenomena","Buoys; Climate change; Data communication systems; Magnetostrictive devices; Ocean engineering; Real time systems; Telecommunication links; Temperature distribution; Three dimensional computer graphics; Transceivers; Giant magnetostrictive source; Ocean acoustic tomography; Acoustic imaging",,,,,,"Munk, W.H., Wunsh, C., (1979) Deep Sea Res., 26, p. 123; Nakano, I., Tsuchiya, T., Nakamura, T., Kamata, H., Nakanishi, T., (1995) Marine Tech.
