The modelling group at GISS has developed new and more physically appropriate parameterizations of meteorological/hydrological processes which are being validated in an effort to improve the performance of the Model II version of the GISS GCM. This study discusses some preliminary evaluations of this testing based on multiple-year simulations at 4° latitude by 5° longitude horizontal resolution. These runs individually incorporate new formulations of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the moist cumulus convection scheme and the ground hydrology and compare results using B-grid and C-grid numerics. The new PBL produces a realistically stronger tropical surface circulation, while the new cumulus scheme generates more realistic distributions of tropical convection and moisture. The main impact of the more sophisticated ground hydrology model is to increase surface air temperatures. Improvements in modelled sea level pressure and rainfall features by the C-grid are somewhat offset by increases in speed excesses at the cores of the summer hemisphere westerly jets. Each modelling innovation targeted a different aspect of the climate not adequately represented by Model II. However, since the various modelling changes were tested individually, the present evaluation could not demonstrate many dramatic improvements in the simulated climates. This documentation of impacts should, however, serve as a benchmark for the validation of future simulations of the GISS GCM that combine all of the modelling improvements. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",,"air temperature; general circulation model; GISS GCM; model improvement; rainfall; sea level pressure; tropical circulation; validation",,,,,,"Arakawa, A., (1972) Design of the UCLA general circulation model, , Tech Rep 7, Dept Meteorol, University of California-Los Angeles, California; Arakawa, A., Schubert, W.H., Interaction of cumulus clouds ensemble with the large scale-environment, part I (1974) Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 31, pp. 674-701; Abramopoulos, F., Rosenzweig, C., Choudhury, B., Improved ground hydrology calculations for global climate models (GCMs): soil water movement and evapotranspiration (1988) Journal of Climate, 1, pp. 921-941; Bishop, J.K., Rossow, W.B., Spatial and temporal variability of global surface solar irradiance (1991) Journal of Geophysical Research, 96, pp. 16839-16858; Budyko, M., The heat balance of the earth (1978) Climatic change, pp. 85-113. , J., Gribbin, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Chervin, R., Druyan, L.M., The influence of ocean surface temperature gradient and continentality in the Walker circulation.
