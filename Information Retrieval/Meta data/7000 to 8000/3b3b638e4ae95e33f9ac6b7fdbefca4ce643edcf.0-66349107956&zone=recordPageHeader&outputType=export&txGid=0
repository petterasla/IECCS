It is responsible for approximately half of global primary production, sustains worldwide fisheries, and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Ocean warming caused by anthropogenic climate change is already starting to impact the marine biota, with possible consequences for ocean productivity and ecosystem services. Because temperature sensitivities of marine autotrophic and heterotrophic processes differ greatly, ocean warming is expected to cause major shifts in the flow of carbon and energy through the pelagic system. Attempts to integrate such biological responses into marine ecosystem and biogeochemical models suffer from a lack of empirical data. Here, we show, using an indoor-mesocosm approach, that rising temperature accelerates respiratory consumption of organic carbon relative to autotrophic production in a natural plankton community. Increasing temperature by 2-6 °C hence decreased the biological drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface layer by up to 31%. Moreover, warming shifted the partitioning between particulate and dissolved organic carbon toward an enhanced accumulation of dissolved compounds. In line with these findings, the loss of organic carbon through sinking was significantly reduced at elevated temperatures. The observed changes in biogenic carbon flow have the potential to reduce the transfer of primary produced organic matter to higher trophic levels, weaken the ocean's biological carbon pump, and hence provide a positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO 2.","Biological feedbacks; Carbon cycle; Climate change; Global warming; Marine","carbon; organic carbon; sea water; article; atmosphere; autotrophy; mesocosm; plankton; priority journal; sea surface temperature; temperature measurement; warming; diatom; greenhouse effect; metabolism; sea; sensitivity and specificity; Carbon; Diatoms; Greenhouse Effect; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Sensitivity and Specificity",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Barnett, T.P., Penetration of human-induced warming into the world's oceans (2005) Science, 309, pp. 284-287; Sabine, C.L., The oceanic sink for anthropogenic CO2 (2004) Science, 305, pp. 367-371; Levitus, S., Antonov, J., Boyer, T., Warming of the world ocean 1955-2003 (2005) Geophys Res Lett, , 10.1029/2004GL021592; Bindoff, N.L., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, pp. 386-432. , eds, Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK, pp; Meehl, G.A., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, pp. 748-845. , eds, Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK, pp; Eppley, R.W., Temperature and phytoplankton growth in the sea (1972) Fish Bull, 70, pp. 1063-1085; Pomeroy, L.R., Wiebe, W.J., Temperature and substrates as interactive limiting factors for marine heterotrophic bacteria (2001) Aquat Microb Ecol, 23, pp. 187-204; Rivkin, R.B., Legendre, L., Biogenic carbon cycling in the upper ocean: Effects of microbial respiration (2001) Science, 291, pp. 2398-2400; Claquin, P., Probert, I., Lefebvre, S., Veron, B., Effects of temperature on photosynthetic parameters and TEP production in eight species of marine microalgae (2008) Aquat Microb Ecol, 51, pp. 1-11; Thornton, D.C.O., Thake, B., Effect of temperature on the aggregation of Skel-etonema costatum (Bacillariophyceae) and the implication for carbon flux in coastal waters (1998) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 174, pp. 223-231; Passow, U., Alldredge, A.L., Aggregation of a diatom bloom in a mesocosm: The role of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) (1995) Deep-Sea Res, II 42, pp. 99-109; Engel, A., Distribution of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) in the northeast Atlantic Ocean and their potential significance for aggregation processes (2004) Deep-Sea Res I, 51, pp. 83-92; Thingstad, T.F., Hagstrom, A., Rassoulzadegan, F., Accumulation of degradable DOC in surface waters: Is it caused by a malfunctioning microbial loop?
