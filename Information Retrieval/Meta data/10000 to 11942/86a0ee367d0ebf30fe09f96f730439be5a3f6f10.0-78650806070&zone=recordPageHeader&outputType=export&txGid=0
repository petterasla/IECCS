A rapid sea level rise is one of the pronounced effects of global warming and global sea level is at present rising at an elevated rate of about 3.4mm y-1 on average. This increasing rate of sea level rise should make it possible to study the effect of rapidly rising sea level on salt marsh accumulation. However, such an understanding is generally hampered by lack of available data with sufficient precision. Here we present a high-precision dataset based on detailed radiometric measurements of 137Cs in 10 sediment cores retrieved at a natural and unmanaged micro tidal salt marsh. Two distinct 137Cs-peaks were found in all cores, one peak corresponding to the 1963-maximum caused by testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere and the other to the Chernobyl accident in 1986. Salt marsh accretion has generally kept pace with sea level rise since 1963 but comparison of the accumulation rates of minerogenic material in the period 1963-1986 and 1986-2003 revealed a slight decrease in accumulation with time in spite of an observed increase in inundation frequency. The observed decrease in sediment deposition is significant and gives reason for concern as it may be the first sign of a sedimentation deficiency which could be threatening this and other salt marshes in the case of a rapidly rising sea level. Our work demonstrates that the assumption of a constant relationship between salt marsh inundation and sediment deposition is not necessarily valid, even for a salt marsh that receives most of its allocthonous sediment from the adjacent sea. The apparent decrease in sediment deposition indicates that the basic assumption of sufficient sediment supply used in contemporary models dealing with salt marsh accretion is most probably not valid in the present case study and it may well be that this is also the case for many other salt marshes, especially if sea level continues to rise rapidly as indicated by some climate change scenarios. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Accretion; Inundation; Salt marsh; Sea level rise; Sedimentation","20th century; Accretion; Accumulation rates; Chernobyl accident; Climate change scenarios; Contemporary models; Data sets; Global sea levels; High-precision; Inundation; Radiometric measurements; Salt marsh; Salt marshes; Sea level rise; Sediment core; Sediment deposition; Sediment supply; Temporal variation; Cesium; Climate models; Global warming; Nuclear reactor accidents; Nuclear weapons; Sea level; Sedimentation; Sedimentology; Sediments; Wetlands; accretion; allochthon; bioaccumulation; cesium isotope; data set; deposition; environmental impact; frequency analysis; global warming; radiometric method; saltmarsh; sea level change; sediment core; sedimentation; temporal variation; tidal cycle; twentieth century",,,,,,"Aagaard, T., Nielsen, N., Nielsen, J., Skallingen - origin and evolution of a barrier spit (1995) Meddeleelser Skalling laboratoriet, 35, p. 85; Allen, J.R.L., Salt-marsh growth and stratification - a numerical-model with special reference to the Severn Estuary, Southwest Britain (1990) Marine Geology, 95 (2), pp. 77-96; Allen, J.R.L., Morphodynamics of Holocene salt marshes: a review sketch from the Atlantic and Southern North Sea coasts of Europe (2000) Quaternary Science Reviews, 19, pp. 1155-1231; Andersen, T.J., Pejrup, M., Suspended sediment transport on a temperate, microtidal mudflat, the Danish Wadden Sea (2001) Marine Geology, 174 (1-4), pp. 69-85; Andersen, T.J., Pejrup, M., Biological mediation of the settling velocity of bed material eroded from an intertidal mudflat, the Danish Wadden Sea (2002) Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 54, pp. 737-745; Andersen, T.J., Mikkelsen, O.A., Møller, A.L., Pejrup, M., Deposition and mixing depths on some European intertidal mudflats based on 210Pb and 137Cs activities (2000) Continental Shelf Research, 20 (12-13), pp. 1569-1591; Andersen, T.J., Pejrup, M., Nielsen, A.A., Long-term and high-resolution measurements of bed level changes in a temperate, microtidal coastal lagoon (2006) Marine Geology, 226 (1-2), pp. 115-125; Appleby, P.G., Chronostratigraphic techniques in recent sediments (2001) Basin Analysis, Coring and Chronological Techniques., 1, pp. 171-203. , Kluwer Academic Publishers, W.M.
