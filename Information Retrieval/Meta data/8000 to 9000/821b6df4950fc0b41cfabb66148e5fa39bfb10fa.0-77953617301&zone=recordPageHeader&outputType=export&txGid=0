Methods: We calculated mortality rate ratios for the heatwave period, using a reference period of the same number of days from the same summer. We conducted alternative analyses and compared our results with those from a timeseries model. Results: We estimated 655 excess deaths, a 6% increase (95% confidence interval, 3-9%), impacting varied geographic/ climate regions. Alternate analyses supported model validity. Conclusions: California experienced excess heat-wave related mortality not restricted to high heat regions. As climate change is anticipated to increase heat events, public health efforts to monitor effects assume greater importance. © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel/Switzerland 2009.","Climate change; Global warming; Heat wave; Monitoring; Mortality; Surveillance","article; climate change; health survey; human; infrared radiation; mortality; United States; California; Climate Change; Humans; Infrared Rays; Mortality; Population Surveillance",,,,,,"Basu, R., Samet, J., Relation between elevated ambient temperature and mortality: A review of the epidemiologic evidence (2002) Epidemiol Rev., 24, pp. 190-202; Blier, W., (2006), http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/123744.pdf, The record-breaking central California heat wave of July, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association /National Weather Service, Monterey, CA, Accessed 31 July 2008(1995), 44, pp. 577-579. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Heat-related mortality-Chicago, July 1995.
