The reported global average for the uncontaminated river system is of the order of about 0.028 mg/l (NO3-N). Hence, our freshwater aquatic systems can no longer be considered natural, at least with respect to nitrogen transport. The average is still below the WHO limit of 100 1 mg/ NO3-N for drinking water, but there are extreme variations in different rivers (Ganges, Krishna, etc.) and at different locations (Cauvery at Tiruchirapalli 29 mg/l, Ganges at Patna, 140 mg/l, etc.). Sedimentbound N is generally less than 1%, but values as high as about 3% have been reported for some rivers indicating rapid transfer of soil organic matter to rivers as particulate organic nitrogen. While the nitrogen story for various groundwater regions is well understood as representing fertilizer run-off, the riverine N is yet to be studied in detail; the link between river processes and global climate change would warrant urgent study of the river system of South Asia, that carries an annual water flux of about 2100 km3 (about 6% of global run-off) and an annual sediment flux of over one billion tons (about 10% of global flux). Rough calculations of available data indicate that the total N flux from rivers to oceans in South Asia is likely to be several factors higher than that indicated by some representative contaminated rivers of the world.","Flux; Nitrogen transport; Rivers; Soil particulate organic matter",,,,,,,"Meybeck, M., Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous transport by world rivers (1982) Am.
