However, to achieve the large cuts required it is necessary to understand the whole-life contribution of all sectors of the electricity industry. Here, a preliminary assessment of the life cycle carbon emissions of the transmission network in Great Britain is presented. Using a 40-year period and assuming a static generation mix it shows that the carbon equivalent emissions (or global warming potential) of the transmission network are around 11gCO2-eq/kWh of electricity transmitted and that almost 19 times more energy is transmitted by the network than is used in its construction and operation. Operational emissions account for 96% of this with transmission losses alone totalling 85% and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions featuring significantly. However, the CO2 embodied within the raw materials of the network infrastructure itself represents a modest 3%. Transmission investment decisions informed by whole-life cycle carbon assessments of network design could balance higher financial and carbon 'capital' costs of larger conductors with lower transmission losses and CO2 emissions over the network lifetime. This will, however, necessitate new regulatory approaches to properly incentivise transmission companies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon footprint; Life cycle; Transmission networks","Carbon emissions; Carbon equivalent emission; Carbon footprint; Electricity industry; Global warming potential; Great Britain; Life-cycle assessments; Network design; Network infrastructure; Network lifetime; Power station; Power systems; Preliminary assessment; Static generation; Sulphur hexafluoride; Transmission companies; Transmission investments; Transmission loss; Transmission networks; Carbon dioxide; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental impact; Global warming; Investments; Sulfur; Sulfur hexafluoride; Wave transmission; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity generation; electricity industry; life cycle analysis; regulatory approach; United Kingdom",,,,,,"(2001) Switchgear Manual, , Henning Gremmel for ABB Calor Emag, Mannheim, Germany, ABB; (2002) Environmental Product Declaration: Double Break Disconnector type SDB range 123-420kV.
