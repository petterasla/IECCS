Box 99470, Mombasa, Kenya","We examined changes in coral assemblages in four back-reef locations across the warm 1998 El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event based on annually collected line-transect data from 3 years before and after this event. The physical locations of the reefs differed such that there was a 120%-275% warm-season range in the SDs of seawater temperatures but only minor differences in mean temperatures, based on 2 non-ENSO years. We tested the predictions that (a) rare warm-water events would produce fewer changes in eurythermal than stenothermal coral assemblages; and (b) after the disturbance, the stenothermal assemblages would more closely resemble the eurythermal ones. The 1998 event produced fewer changes in coral cover and community similarity among the assemblages in the reefs with high variation in temperature than in those with low variation in temperature. Despite the initially lower taxonomic richness in the eurythermal assemblage, there was an additional loss of taxonomic richness in the high and none in the stenothermal reefs. There was some evidence for taxonomic convergence, of the stenothermal towards the eurythermal reefs and a general loss of some of the branching taxa, such as branching Porités, Pavana, and Stylophora, and a relative increase in massive Porités and Favia. There was, however, moderate site specificity that did not produce true convergence. The eurythermal assemblages maintained the basic community structure but lost taxonomic richness, whereas the opposite was true for the stenothermal assemblages.","Bleaching; Coral community structure; Diversity; El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); Global climate change; Resilience; Stability; Stress","climate change; community structure; coral; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; water temperature; Anthozoa; Favia; Porites; Scleractinia",,,,,,"Baker, A.C., Reef corals bleach to survive change (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 765-766; Berkelmans, R., Oliver, J.K., Large-scale bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 55-60; Berkelmans, R., Willis, B.L., Seasonal and local spatial patterns in the upper thermal limits of corals on the inshore central Great Barrier Reef (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 219-228; Bertness, M.D., Hacker, S.D., Physical stress and positive associations among marsh plants (1994) Am Nat, 144, pp. 363-372; Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching: Causes and consequences (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. S129-138; Brown, B.E., Suharsono, Damage and recovery of coral reefs affected by El Niño related seawater warming in the Thousand Islands, Indonesia (1990) Coral Reefs, 8, pp. 163-170; Cane, M.A., Clement, A.C., Kaplan, A., Kushnir, Y., Pozdnyakov, D., Seager, R., Zebiak, S.E., Murtugudde, R., Twentieth-century sea surface temperature trends (1997) Science, 275, pp. 957-960; Chen, J., Carlson, B.E., Del Genio, A.D., Evidence for strengthening of the tropical general circulation in the 1990s (2002) Science, 295, pp. 838-841; Coles, S.L., Reef corals occurring in a highly fluctuating temperature environment at Fahal Island, Gulf of Oman (Indian Ocean) (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. 269-272; Coles, S.L., Lewis, C.R., Thermal tolerance in tropical versus subtropical reef corals (1976) Pac Sci, 30, pp. 159-166; Craig, P., Birkeland, C., Belliveau, S., High temperature tolerated by a diverse assemblage of shallow-water corals in American Samoa (2001) Coral Reefs, 20, pp. 185-189; D'Croz, L., Mate, J.L., Oke, J.E., Responses to elevated sea water temperature and UV radiation in the coral Porités lobata from upwelling and non-upwelling environments on the Pacific coast of Panama (2001) Bull Mar Sci, 69, pp. 203-214; Dunne, R.P., Brown, B.E., The influence of solar radiation on bleaching of shallow water reef corals in the Andaman Sea, 1993-1998 (2001) Coral Reefs, 20, pp. 201-210; Fang, L., Huang, S., Lin, K., High temperature induces the synthesis of heat shock proteins and the elevation of intracel-lular calcium in the coral Acropora grandis (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. 127-131; Gates, R.D., Edmunds, P.J., The physiological mechanisms of acclimatization in tropical reef corals (1999) Am Zool, 39, pp. 30-43; Gleason, D.F., Wellington, G.M., Ultraviolet radiation and coral bleaching (1993) Nature, 365, pp. 836-838; Glynn, P.W., Coral reef bleaching: Facts, hypotheses and implications (1996) Global Change Biol, 2, pp. 495-509; Glynn, P.W., El Nino-Southern Oscillation mass mortalities of reef corals: A model of high temperature marine extinctions?
