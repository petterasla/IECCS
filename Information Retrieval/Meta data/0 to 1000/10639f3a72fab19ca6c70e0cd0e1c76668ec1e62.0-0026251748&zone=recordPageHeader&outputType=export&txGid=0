An approach suggested is to generate electricity by processes that facilitate capture of the CO2, and then to compress and inject it into suitable underground formations. By using formations containing uneconomical deposits of energy sources such as oil, gas, Fe++, coal, etc. underground bioconversion of the CO2 to recoverable fuel forms may prove possible.",,"Air Pollution - Control; Carbon Dioxide - Bioconversion; Electric Power Generation - Modification; Emissions Reduction; Greenhouse Gas; Underground Carbon Dioxide Conversion; Greenhouse Effect",,,,,,,"Simpson, Theodore B.; U.S. Dept of Energy, Washington, United States",,,,,,,,02784491,,ENVPD,,"English","Environ Prog",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026251748
