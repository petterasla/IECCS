Global climate models almost unanimously project that human-induced climate change will reduce runoff in this region by 10-30%. This work explores whether currently scheduled future water deliveries from the Colorado River system are sustainable under different climate-change scenarios. If climate change reduces runoff by 10%, scheduled deliveries will be missed ≈58% of the time by 2050. If runoff reduces 20%, they will be missed ≈88% of the time. The mean shortfall when full deliveries cannot be met increases from ≈0.5-0.7 billion cubic meters per year (bcm/yr) in 2025 to ≈1.2-1.9 bcm/yr by 2050 out of a request of ≈17.3 bcm/yr. Such values are small enough to be manageable. The chance of a year with deliveries <14.5 bcm/yr increases to 21% by midcentury if runoff reduces 20%, but such low deliveries could be largely avoided by reducing scheduled deliveries. These results are computed by using estimates of Colorado River flow from the 20th century, which was unusually wet; if the river reverts to its long-term mean, shortfalls increase another 1-1.5 bcm/yr. With either climate-change or long-term mean flows, currently scheduled future water deliveries from the Colorado River are not sustainable. However, the ability of the system to mitigate droughts can be maintained if the various users of the river find a way to reduce average deliveries.","Climate change; Global warming; Hydrology; Sustainability water resources","river water; article; climate change; drought; global climate; priority journal; temperature; United States; water flow; water supply; climate; economics; river; Climate; Rivers; United States; Water Supply",,,,,,"Mote, P.W., Hamlet, A.F., Clark, M.P., Lettenmaier, D.P., Declining mountain snowpack in western North America (2005) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 86, pp. 39-49; Nash, L.L., Gleick, P.H., Sensitivity of stream flow in the Colorado basin to climate change (1991) J Hydrol, 125, pp. 221-241; Bonfils, C., Detection and attribution of temperature changes in the mountainous western United States (2008) J Climate, 21, pp. 6404-6424; Barnett, T.P., Human-induced changes in the hydrology of the western United States (2008) Science, 319, pp. 1080-1083; Pierce, D.W., Attribution of declining western U.S. snowpack to human effects (2008) J Clim ate, 21, pp. 6425-6444; Hidalgo, H.G., Detection and attribution of streamflow timing changes to climate change in the western United States (2009) J Climate, , January 26, 10.1175/2009JCLI2470.1; McCabe, G.J., Warming may create substantial watersupply shortages in the Colorado River basin (2007) Geophys Res Lett, , WolockDM , 10.1029/2007GL031764; Nash L, Gleick P (1993) The Colorado Basin and climate change.
