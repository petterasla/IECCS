Different results might be obtained by using various GCMs' predictions, which causes difficulties on the decision making of water resources management. This study proposed an integrated hydrological simulations and optimization framework, consisting of a fuzzy linear programming model with interval numbers, a streamflow simulation model, and agricultural water demand projections, to evaluate the impacts of climate change on reservoir active storage. The reservoir inflows are simulated by the WatBal model, while agricultural water demands are predicted based on the projected change of potential evapotranspiration. Inflows and water demands are used to formulate an interval number fuzzy linear programming model. Fuzzy relationships are used to describe tolerable deficits of water resources, and the interval number is employed to indicate ranges of possible inflows and water demands. This systematic framework is applied to study the Tsengwen reservoir watershed to provide an optimal interval of active storage. The results further indicate the higher tolerable deficit, the smaller difference between superior and inferior active storage. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Climatic change; Global warming; Uncertainty; Water resources","decision making; environmental impact assessment; evapotranspiration; fuzzy mathematics; general circulation model; global warming; linear programing; numerical model; optimization; reservoir; streamflow; uncertainty analysis; water demand; water management; water resource; water storage; Taiwan; Tseng-wen Basin",,,,,,"Gleick, P.H., The development and testing of a water balance model of climate impact assessment: Modeling the Sacramento Basin (1987) Water Resour Res, 23 (6), pp. 1049-1061; Hamon, W.R., Estimating potential evapotranspiration: Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (1961) J Hydraul Div, 87 (3), pp. 107-120; Kaczmarek, Z., Water balance model of climate impacts analysis (1993) ACTC Geophys Pol, 41 (4), pp. 1-16; Loucks, D.P., Stedinger, J.R., Douglas, A.H., (1981) Water Resource Systems Planning and Analysis, , Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc; McCabe, G.J., Wolock, D.M., Hay, L.E., Ayers, M.A., Effects of climatic change on the Thornthwaite moisture index (1990) Water Resour Bull, 26 (4), pp. 633-643; Negoita, C.V., Sularia, M., On fuzzy programming and tolerances in planning (1976) Econ Comp Econ Cybernet Stud Res, 1, pp. 3-15; Shaocheng, T., Interval number and fuzzy number linear programming (1994) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 66, pp. 301-306; Tung, C.P., Climate change impacts on water resource of the Tsengwen Creek watershed in Taiwan (2001) J Am Water Resour Assoc, 37 (1), pp. 167-176; Tung, C.P., Haith, D.A., Global warming effects on New York streamflows (1995) J Water Resour Plan Manag, 121 (2), pp. 216-225; Tung, C.P., Haith, D.A., Climate change, irrigation, and crop response (1998) J Am Water Resour Assoc, 34 (5), pp. 1071-1085; Yates, D., WatBal: An integrated water balance model for climate impact assessment of river basin runoff (1996) Water Resour Dev, 12 (2), pp. 121-139; Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy sets (1965) Inf Control, 8, pp. 338-353","Hong, N.-M.; Department of Environmental Resources Management, Overseas Chinese University, Overseas Chinese Institute of Technology, 100, Chiao Kwang Rd, 407 Taichung, Taiwan; email: hong@ocu.edu.tw",,,,,,,,16112490,,,,"English","Paddy Water Environ.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954083203
