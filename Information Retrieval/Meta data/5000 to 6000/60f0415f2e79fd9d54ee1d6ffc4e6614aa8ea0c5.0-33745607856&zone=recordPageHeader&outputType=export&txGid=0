The corresponding homogeneous solution to the differential equation is assumed to be non-expansive and the inhomogeneity is a linear function of the control variable that is constant along a priori given sub-intervals. The optimal control minimises a convex functional that depends, possibly in a non-linear way, on the solution of the differential equation. Infinite time horizons are allowed. In view of the piecewise constant control, the corresponding Lagrangian can be split into the sum of Lagrangians acting on sub-intervals. The two algorithms suggested are based on an iterative process that takes advantage of this splitting as well as of the explicit solution to the differential constraints. Convergence results are provided under suitable assumptions on the problems data. Finally, numerical tests for a model of global warming demonstrate the performance of the algorithms.","Convergence; Global warming; Iteration; Optimal control; Ordinary differential equation","Algorithms; Boundary value problems; Differential equations; Global warming; Iterative methods; Lagrange multipliers; Numerical methods; Differential equations; Global warming; Initial value problems; Iterative methods; Linear systems; Optimal control systems; Convergence; Iteration; Optimal control; Ordinary differential equation; Optimal control systems; Ordinary differential equations; Convergence; Differential constraints; Homogeneous solutions; Infinite time horizon; Iteration; Optimal control problem; Optimal controls; Piecewise constant control",,,,,,"Macki, J., Strauss, A., (1982) Introduction to Optimal Control Theory, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Capuzzo Dolcetta, I., Ishii, H., Approximate solutions of the Bellman equation of deterministic control theory (1984) Applied Mathematics and Optimization, 11, pp. 161-181; Falcone, M., A numerical approach to the infinite horizon problem of deterministic control theory (1987) Applied Mathematics and Optimization, 15, pp. 1-13; Wirl, F., Global warming and carbon taxes: Dynamic and strategic interactions between energy consumers and producers (1994) Journal of Policy Modelling, 16 (6), pp. 577-596; Grüne, L., An adaptive grid scheme for the discrete Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (1997) Numerische Mathematik, 75, pp. 319-337; Varaiya, P., (1972) Notes on Optimization, , New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold; Amann, H., (1983) Gewöhnliche Differentialgleichungen, , Berlin and New York: W. de Gruyter; Felder, S., Meier, M., Schmitt, H., Health care expenditure in the last months of life (2000) Journal of Health Economics, 19, pp. 679-695; Stoer, J., (1983) Einführung in Die.
