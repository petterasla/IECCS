The model is based on the material balance at the soil surface, and assumes that the relationship between soil depth and soil carbon is linear. The estimated soil degradation rates were of the similar order of magnitude, and we concluded that this model might be used for rough estimation of soil carbon degradation rates of forest soils where vertical distributions of soil carbon are available.","Carbon sinks; Forests; Global warming; Soil carbon dynamics","Degradation; Mathematical models; Rate constants; Soils; Forest soils; Chemical engineering; global warming",,,,,,"Bernoux, M., Cerri, C.C., Neill, C., de Moraes, J.F.L., The use of stable carbon isotope for estimating soil organic matter turnover rates (1998) Geoderma, 82, pp. 43-58; Chertov, O.G., Komarov, A.S., Nadporozhskaya, M., Bykhovets, S.S., Zudin, S.L., ROMUL - A model of forest soil organic matter dynamics as a substantial tool for forest ecosystem modeling (2001) Ecological Modeling, 138, pp. 289-308; Chiba, K., Studies on the mineralization rate of organic matter in forest soils and the rate of the soil respiration of forests (1975) Mem.
