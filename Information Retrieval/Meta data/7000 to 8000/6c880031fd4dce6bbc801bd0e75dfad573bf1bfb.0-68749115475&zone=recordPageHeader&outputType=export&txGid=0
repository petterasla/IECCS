Results are presented of a global study of the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) changes over the last 25 years on the fisheries yields of 63 large marine ecosystems (LMEs) that annually produce 80% of the world's marine fisheries catches. Warming trends were observed.in 61 LMEs around the globe. In 18 of the LMEs, rates of SST warming were two to four times faster during the past 25 years than the globally averaged rates of SST warming reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. Effects of warming on fisheries biomass yields were greatest in the fast-warming northern Northeast Atlantic LMEs, where increasing trends in fisheries biomass yields were related to zooplankton biomass increases. In contrast, fisheries biomass yields of LMEs in the fast-warming, more southerly reaches of the Northeast Atlantic were declining in response to decreases in zooplankton abundance. The LMEs around the margins of the Indian Ocean, where SSTs were among the world's slowest warming, revealed a consistent pattern of fisheries biomass increases during the past 25 years, driven principally by human need for food security from fisheries resources. As a precautionary approach toward more sustainable fisheries utilization, management measures to limit the total allowable catch through a cap-and-sustain approach are suggested for the developing nations recently fishing heavily on resources of the Agulhas Current, Somali Current, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal LMEs. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2009.",,"sea water; biomass; climate change; developing world; fishery; global climate; marine ecosystem; maximum sustainable yield; oceanic current; sea surface temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; zooplankton; animal; article; biomass; comparative study; ecosystem; environmental protection; food industry; greenhouse effect; health; human; international cooperation; sea; statistical model; statistics; temperature; time; Animals; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Global Warming; Humans; Internationality; Linear Models; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Temperature; Time Factors; World Health; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Indian Ocean",,,,,,"Garcia, S.M., Newton, C., (1997) Current situation, trends, and prospects in world capture fisheries.
