Global climate change does not justify a considerably increased global nuclear programme for the next two to three decades. Even if for other political or socioeconomic reasons such as intensive global nuclear programme were initiated, its impact on CO2 emissions would be only marginal. This is true irrespective of the costs and feasibilities of alternative emission reduction strategies, such as energy efficiency measures, or the availability of other low CO2 energy supplies. © 1991.","Climate change; Nuclear power; Reduction strategies","carbon dioxide; electricity generation; emission reduction; nuclear power",,,,,,"Keepin, Review of global energy and carbon dioxide projections (1986) Annual Review of Energy, 11, pp. 357-392; The United Nations Environment Programme and the Beijer Institute, (1989) The Full Range of Responses to Anticipated Climatic Change, , UNEP, Nairobi, Kenya; Fritsche, Rausch, Simon, (1989) Environmental Analysis of Energy Systems: The Total-Emission-Model for Integrated Systems, , The Oeko Institut, Darmstadt, West Germany; International Atomic Energy Agency, Nuclear Power and Fuel Cycle: Status and Trends 1989 (1989) IAEA Yearbook, , Part C of the, IAEA, Vienna; IbidIbidNuclear Energy Agency of the OECD, (1989) Nuclear Energy Data — 1989, , NEA/OECD, Paris; World Energy Conference, Global Energy in Perspective 2000–2020 (1989) 14th Congress in Montreal, , Canada; NEA, op cit, Ref 7IbidMoberg, (1986) Nuclear Power in Crisis, , WISE, Amsterdam; NEA, op cit, Ref 7International Atomic Energy Agency, Nuclear Energy and the Environment (1989) a report prepared at the request of the IAEA General Conference for presentation to the United Nations General Assembly, , IAEA, Vienna; IbidYingzhong, (1989) Long-term Energy Forecasting of PRC and Strategies in the Development of Nuclear Energy, , Institute of Nuclear Energy Technology, Beijing, China; Yingzhong, (1986) ORAU/IEA Working Paper, , Also an; Yingzhong, Ordeals of Chernobyl and the re-justification of the inherently safe reactors (1987) paper presented to the 11th International Scientific Forum on Fuelling the 21st Century, , Moscow; Chandler, Assessing carbon emission control strategies the case of China (1988) Climatic Change, (13), pp. 241-265; (1988) Reports in Nuclear Engineering International; K.E.

These are clearly very optimistic assumptions!This means a continued and increased concern over the effects of acid rain and air pollution caused by fossil fuels, but a somewhat reduced concern over the climate change issue, following the realization, that although real, the effects would not be as serious as previously assumedThis also assumes that nuclear generation would be replaced by coal-based electricity. However, the study did assume a 25% decrease in carbon emissions from coal plants, given changes in efficiency and increased use of cogenerationVarley, COMECON plans still ambitious (1988) Nuclear Engineering International; IAEA, op cit, Ref 4Surrey, op cit, Ref 85For generic studies of this issue see for example Keepin and Kats, op cit, Ref 103Goldemberg, Johansson, Reddy, Williams, (1988) Energy for a Sustainable World, , John Wiley and Sons, New Delhi, for a country study of the role of energy efficiency measures see EGES, op cit, Ref 82","Pasztor, J.; Janos Pasztor is with Stockholm Environment Institute, Boston Center, 89 Broad Street, Boston, MA 02110, United States",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026055725
