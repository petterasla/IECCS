This paper tackles the societal concern of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by introducing a simple junior or senior-level experiment that illustrates the phenomenon of gas adsorption as a tool for carbon dioxide separation from a gas stream that simulates power plant flue gas emissions. The experiment familiarizes chemical and environmental engineering students with the characteristics of gas separation by adsorption with activated alumina, zeolite 13X, and soda lime, while highlighting its potential for carbon dioxide reduction at ambient conditions and at a relevant concentration (partial pressure) of carbon dioxide. This should be of interest to faculty who teach unit operations-type laboratory courses; they will find it an excellent sustainable engineering' hands-on addendum to traditional curricula. © 2007 TEMPUS Publications.","Carbon dioxide sequestration; Gas adsorption; Mass transfer; Unit operations experiment",,,,,,,"E-Wire, Environment, Health, Science, Technology (2002) BAT International Inc.
