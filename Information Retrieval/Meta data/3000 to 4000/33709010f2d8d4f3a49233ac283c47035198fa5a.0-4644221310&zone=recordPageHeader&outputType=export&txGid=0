Mar./Polar Res., 27568 Bremerhaven, Germany","The hypothesis of an oxygen-limited thermal tolerance due to restrictions in cardiovascular performance at extreme temperatures was tested in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua (North Sea). Heart rate, changes in arterial and venous blood flow, and venous oxygen tensions were determined during an acute temperature change to define pejus (""getting worse"") temperatures that border the thermal optimum range. An exponential increase in heart rate occurred between 2 and 16°C (Q10 = 2.38 ± 0.35). Thermal sensitivity was reduced beyond 16°C when cardiac arrhythmia became visible. Flow-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of temperature-dependent blood flow revealed no exponential but a hyperbolic increase of blood flow with a moderate linear increase at temperatures &gt;4°C. Therefore, temperature-dependent heart rate increments are not mirrored by similar increments in blood flow. Venous PO2 (PvO2), which reflects the quality of oxygen supply to the heart of cod (no coronary circulation present), followed an inverse U-shaped curve with highest Pv O2 levels at 5.0 ± 0.2°C. Thermal limitation of circulatory performance in cod set in below 2°C and beyond 7°C, respectively, characterized by decreased PvO2. Further warming led to a sharp drop in PvO2 beyond 16.1 ± 1.2°C in accordance with the onset of cardiac arrhythmia and, likely, the critical temperature. In conclusion, progressive cooling or warming brings cod from a temperature range of optimum cardiac performance into a pejus range, when aerobic scope falls before critical temperatures are reached. These patterns might cause a shift in the geographical distribution of cod with global warming.","Blood flow; Heart rate; In vivo magnetic resonance imagine; Venous oxygen partial pressure","animal experiment; animal tissue; artery blood flow; article; Atlantic cod; cardiovascular performance; controlled study; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; heart arrhythmia; heart rate; heat sensitivity; heat tolerance; hypoxia; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen supply; priority journal; venous oxygen tension; Aerobiosis; Animals; Arrhythmia; Body Temperature Regulation; Cold; Fishes; Heart Rate; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Oxygen; Regional Blood Flow",,"Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Axelsson, M., Nilsson, S., Blood pressure control during exercise in the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua (1986) J Exp Biol, 126, pp. 225-236; Björnsson, B., Steinarsson, A., Oddgeirsson, M., Optimal temperature for growth and feed conversion of immature cod (Gadus morhua L.)
