As these gases are produced only during anode effects, which are undesirable for other production reasons as well, aluminum producers are aggressively examining ways to reduce the number of anode effects that occur as well as their duration. © 1994 TMS.",,"Anodes; Anodic oxidation; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Fluorocarbons; Greenhouse effect; Organic compounds; Aluminum industry; Anode effects; Carbon anodes; Global warming; Perfluorinated carbon compounds; Soderberg cells; Aluminum",,,,,,"Calandra, A.J., Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of the Anode Effect in Industrial Cells (1982) Light Metals 1982, pp. 345-359. , Springer-Verlag, New York; Saksvikrønning, T., Valsvik, G., Hove, S.J., Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of the Anode Effect in Industrial Cells (1982) Light Metals 1982, pp. 553-557. , Springer-Verlag, New York; Brandtzaeg, S.R., Paulsen, K.A., Thovsen, K., Automatic Anode Effect Termination System for Söderberg Pots (1988) Light Metals 1988, pp. 603-606. , C.
