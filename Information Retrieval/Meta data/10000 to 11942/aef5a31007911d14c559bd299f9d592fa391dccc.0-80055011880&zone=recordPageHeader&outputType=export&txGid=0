The system was interpreted in two ways; comparing the disposal of a single cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor and the expected regional change in monitor disposals between 2008 and 2010. The results were separated into two scenarios, one in which credit was given for the avoidance of primary material production in response to the generation of recyclables and one where credit was not given. The effect of avoiding primary material production was large enough to change the impact assessment results from a system that consumed energy, contributed to global warming, and generated air emissions to one that produced energy, reduced global warming, and was a sink of air emissions. LCD monitor disposal had lower impacts than CRT monitor disposal in all impact categories except for the management of mercury. This translates into a reduction of the impact or an increase in the benefit for each impact category, except the management of mercury, for the system from 2008 to 2010 due to changing composition of the monitor disposal stream from CRT to LCD technology. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
