To assess the significance of this change, wave statistics for the 20th century were reconstructed with a statistical model. With a linear multivariate technique (redundancy analysis), monthly mean air pressure fields over the North Atlantic and Western Europe were downscaled on the intramonthly frequency of directional wave propagation. When compared against this reference, the recent change appears statistically significant at the 5% level. In order to investigate the reason for this local climatic change, the reconstruction was compared with the downscaled results of control and transient GCM scenarios (ECHAM4-OPYC3) and with the results obtained in a high-resolution time-slice experiment with increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Both estimates are qualitatively consistent with the changes observed in the last 4 decades. We suggest that the recent increase in eastward propagation is a local manifestation of anthropogenic global climate change.","Attribution; Climate change; Detection; Statistical downscaling; Wave climate","climate change; downscaling; easterly wave; marine environment; numerical model; wave propagation; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",,,,,,"Bauer, E., Scrum, C., Duwe, K., (2000) Klimatologie and Prognose Klimainduzierte Änderungen Hydrographischer Größen in Nord- Und Ostsee, p. 26. , BMBF-Projekt KLINO 03F0185A, Abschlussbericht Teilprojekt A, Hamburg, April 2000; Beersma, J., Rider, K., Komen, G., Kaas, E., Kharin, V., An analysis of extratropical storms in the North Atlantic region as simulated in a control and a 2 x CO2 time-slice experiment with a high resolution atmospheric model (1997) Tellus, 49 A, pp. 347-361; Busuioc, A., von Storch, H., Schnur, R., Verification of GCM generated regional precipitation and of statistical down-scaling estimates (1999) J Clim, 12, pp. 258-272; Charles, S.P., Bates, B.C., Whetton, P.H., Hughes, J.P., Validation of downscaling models for changed climate conditions: Case study of Southwestern Australia (1999) Clim Res, 12, pp. 1-14; Fyfe, J.C., Boer, G.J., Flato, G.M., The Arctic and Antarctic Oscillation and their projected changes under global warming (1999) Geophys Res Lett, 26, pp. 1601-1604; Gonzalez-Rouco, F., Zorita, E., Heyen, H., Valero, F., Agreement between observed rainfall trends and climate change simulations in the Southwest of Europe (2000) J Clim, 13, pp. 3057-3065; Grevemeyer, I., Herbert, R., Essen, H.H., Microseismological eveidence for a changing wave climate in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 349-352; Günther, H., Rosental, W., Stawarz, M., Carretero, J.C., Gomez, M., Lozano, I., Serrano, O., Reistad, M., The wave climate of the Northeast Atlantic over the period 1955-94: The WASA wave hindcast (1998) Global Atmos Ocean Syst, 6, pp. 121-163; Hegerl, G.C., von Storch, H., Applying coupled ocean-atmosphere models for prediction, detecting and specifying climate change (1996) Z Angew Math Mech, 76 (4 SUPPL.), pp. 482-485. , I-XII; Hegerl, G.C., von Storch, H., Hasselmann, K., Santer, B.D., Cubasch, U., Jones, P.D., Detecting greenhouse-gas-induced climate change with an optimal fingerprint method (1996) J Clim, 9, pp. 2281-2306; Hurrell, J.W., Decadel trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation: Regional temperatures and precipitation (1995) Science, 269, pp. 676-679; (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change: Contribution of the Working Group I to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Houghton J.T., Madeira Filho L.G., Callander B.A., Harris N., Kattenberg A., Maskell K.
