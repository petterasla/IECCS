An extreme value analysis based on the Generalized Pareto distributions shows that both cold winter and hot summer extremes have evolved differently from their means. The reasons for the trends in extremes occurrence are related to changes in the underlying atmospheric circulation. Of particular interest are the winter extreme cold days. In recent years, around 80% of these occurred on anticyclonic or easterly type days, compared to only 50% at the beginning of the 20th century. This change is related to cooling temperatures on these type days since the 1930s. Such a trend has placed an effective cap on any upward trend in winter cold extremes related to global warming so far.",,"Climatology; Storms; Temperature measurement; Global warming; Atmospheric circulation; Global warming; Pareto principle; anticyclone; extreme event; temperature anomaly; United Kingdom; 20th century; Atmospheric circulation; Cooling temperature; Extreme temperatures; Extreme value analysis; Generalized Pareto Distributions; Mean temperature; Upward trend",,,,,,"Horton, E.B., Folland, C.K., Parker, D.E., Changing incidence of extremes in worldwide and central England temperatures to the end of the twentieth century (2001) Climatic Change, 50, pp. 267-295; Hosking, J.R., Wallis, J.R., Parameter and quantile estimation for the generalized Pareto distribution (1987) Technometrics, 29, pp. 339-349; Hurrell, J.W., Decadal trends in the North Atlantic oscillation and relationships to regional temperature and precipitation (1995) Science, 269, pp. 676-679; Jenkinson, A.F., Collison, F.P., An initial climatology of gales over the North Sea (1977) Synoptic Climatology Branch Memorandum No. 62, , Meteorological Office, Bracknell; Jones, P.D., The early twentieth century Arctic high-fact or fiction?
