It contains two distinct and successional species, both new. and differentiated by their apertural details. In Duoforisa rima the apertures are slit-like, and become radial in the descendant D. diducta. Intermediate forms have transitional apertural configurations between the slit type and radial type, accompanied also by a change of the test outline from subtriangular to compactly U-shaped. The evolution of the lineage occurred during a period of enhanced upwelling in the Early Miocene and it was terminated just before the global warming at the Early-Middle Miocene boundary. This example suggests evolution of the unilocular foraminifera through successional morphological changes in test shape and in the aperture. Unilocular taxa have tended to flourish or speciate in cool or upwelling environments. Their contraction in the latest Early Miocene to early Middle Miocene was probably due to global warming and well oxygenated conditions which were widespread in the neritic domains of southern Australia. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Duoforisa gen. nov; Evolution; Late Oligocene; Miocene; Palaeoenvironment; Unilocular foraminifera; Upwelling; Victoria",,,,,,,"Abele, C., Gloe, C.S., Hocking, J.B., Holdgate, G., Kenley, P.R., Lawrence, C.R., Ripper, D., Threlfall, W.F., Tertiary (1976) Geology of Victoria, 5, pp. 177-274. , J.G.
