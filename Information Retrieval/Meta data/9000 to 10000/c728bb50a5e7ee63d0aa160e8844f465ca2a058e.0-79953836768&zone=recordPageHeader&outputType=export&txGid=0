The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), an initiative of the north-east and mid-Atlantic States of the US for limiting the emission of GHG, has proposed a regional cap-and-trade program for CO2 emissions for power plants. This forthcoming emissions market is expected to have a major impact on the developing deregulated wholesale electricity markets. Our goal is to model and study the interaction of these two markets and to assess the impact of the emissions market on wholesale electricity prices.","cap and trade markets; Dynamic games; electricity markets; greenhouse emissions; RGGI","Cap and trade; Dynamic games; electricity markets; greenhouse emissions; RGGI; Carbon dioxide; Deregulation; Electricity; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Commerce",,,,,,"Aumann, R., (1983) What Is Game Theory Trying to Accomplish?
