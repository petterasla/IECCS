The ability for biomass production and CO2 fixation was evaluated by using a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis aquatilis SI-2. The average areal productivity was 31 g biomass m-2 d-1, which corresponded to a CO2 fixation rate of 51 g CO2 m-2 d-1, sustainable in the northern region of Japan during the winter time (January and February). The relationships between the efficiency of solar energy utilization of the reactor and its effect factors (cell concentration and irradiation) were investigated.","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Microalgae; Outdoor culture; Photobioreactor","alga; article; biomass; bioreactor; carbon dioxide fixation; Cyanobacterium; Japan; nonhuman; photosynthesis; solar energy; winter; algae; Synechocystis aquatilis; Synechocystis sp.",,,,,,"Grobbelaar, J.U., Nedbal, L., Tichy, L., Setlik, I., Variation in some photosynthetic characteristics of microalgae cultured in outdoor thin-layered sloping reactors (1995) J.
