A profile of the summer mean meridional wind over eastern China for the past 40 years shows a coherent interdecadal weakening trend for the EASM. The decadal-scale (11-year running mean) summertime (June-August) wind and springtime (March-May) SAT fields are decomposed using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method. The results indicate that both the leading eigenvector of the decadal-scale meridional wind and that for the SAT over East Asia account for more than 70% of the total variance. Their time coefficients show a similar trend, with the transition from negative to positive values occurring around 1978; i.e., the EASM turned from a stronger phase to a weaker phase around 1978. The springtime sea/ land SAT distribution before and after 1978 also showed a shift in interdecadal trends. Therefore, the south-low/north-high nature of the principal component of springtime SAT over eastern China is closely related to the progressive weakening of the EASM. Our results suggest that within the context of the regional impact of global climate change, heterogeneous changes in the regional springtime sea/land SAT in eastern Asia might in part have led to a weakening of the effect of sea/land thermal driving on the EASM. © 2007, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"air temperature; atmospheric structure; climate change; decadal variation; global change; meridional circulation; monsoon; regional climate; summer; wind; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West); South China Sea",,,,,,"Bueh, C., Ulrich, C., Lin, Y., Ji, L., The change of North China climate in transient simulations using the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios with a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (2003) Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 20 (5), pp. 755-766; Chen, L., Zhu, W., Wang, W., Zhou, X., Li, W., Climate change in China in the recent 45 years (1998) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 56, pp. 257-271. , in Chinese with English abstract; Chen, L., Zhou, X., Li, W., Luo, Y., Zhu, W., Characteristics of the climate change and its formation mechanism in china in last 80 years (2004) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 62, pp. 634-645. , in Chinese with English abstract; Ding, Y., Changes in Asian Summer Monsoon and Possible Mechanisms (2004) Climate Change Newsletter, 2003-2004, pp. 47-51; Gong, D., Global warning and the summer flooding risk in China (1999) Journal of Natural Disasters, 8, pp. 30-37. , in Chinese with English abstract; Gong, D., Wang, S., Severe summer rainfall in China associated with the enhanced global warming (2000) Climate Res, 16 (1), pp. 51-59; Guo, Q., Cai, J., Shao, X., Sha, W., Interdecadal variability of East Asian Summer Monsoon and its impact on the climate of China (2003) Acta Geographica Sinica, 58, pp. 569-576. , in Chinese with English abstract; Guo, Y., Yu, Y., Liu, X., Simulation of climate change induced by CO2 increasing for East Asia with IAP/LASG GOALS Model (2001) Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 18, pp. 53-66; (2001) Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the international Panel on Climate Change, pp. 112-124. , Houghton, T, Y.
