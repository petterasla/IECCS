Limited studies have shown that nitroethane inhibits ruminal methane production, which represents a loss of 2-12% of the host's gross energy intake and contributes to global warming and destruction of the ozone layer. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of 14-day oral nitroethane administration, 0 (0X), 80 (1X) or 160 (2X) mg nitroethane/kg body weight per day on ruminal and fecal E. coli and Campylobacter, ruminal and fecal methane-producing and nitroethane-reducing activity, whole animal methane emissions, and ruminal and fecal fermentation balance in Holstein steers (n = 6 per treatment) averaging 403±26 (SD) kg BW. An experimental chlorate product was fed the day following the last nitroethane administration to determine effects on E. coli and Campylobacter. The experimental chlorate product decreased (P &lt; 0.001) fecal, but not ruminal (P &gt; 0.05) E. coli concentrations by 1000- and 10-fold by 24 and 48 h, respectively, after chlorate feeding when compared to pre-treatment concentrations (&gt;5.7 log10 colony forming units/g). No effects (P &gt; 0.05) of nitroethane or the experimental chlorate product were observed on fecal Campylobacter concentrations; Campylobacter were not recovered from ruminal contents. Nitroethane treatment decreased (P &lt; 0.01) ruminal (8.46, 7.91 and 4.74±0.78 μmol/g/h) and fecal (3.90, 1.36 and 1.38±0.50 μmol/g/h) methane-producing activity for treatments 0X, 1X and 2X, respectively. Administration of nitroethane increased (P &lt; 0.001) nitroethane-reducing activity in ruminal, but not fecal samples. Day of study affected ruminal (P &lt; 0.0001) but not fecal (P &gt; 0.05) methane-producing and nitroethane-reducing activities (P &lt; 0.01); treatment by day interactions were not observed (P &gt; 0.05). Ruminal accumulations of acetate decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in 2X-treated steers when compared with 0X- and 1X-treated steers, but no effect (P &gt; 0.05) of nitroethane was observed on propionate, butyrate or the acetate to propionate ratio. Whole animal methane emissions, expressed as L/day or as a proportion of gross energy intake (%GEI), were unaffected by nitroethane treatment (P &gt; 0.05), and were not correlated (P &gt; 0.05) with ruminal methane-producing activity. These results demonstrate that oral nitroethane administration reduces ruminal methane-producing activity but suggest that a microbial adaptation, likely due to an in situ enrichment of ruminal nitroethane-reducing bacteria, may cause depletion of nitroethane, at least at the 1X administration dose, to concentrations too low to be effective. Further research is warranted to determine if the optimization of dosage of nitroethane or related nitrocompouds can maintain the enteropathogen control and anti-methanogen effect in fed steers.","Chlorate; Feces; Methane; Nitroethane; Pre-harvest food safety; Rumen","chlorate; methane; nitroethane; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal food; animal model; article; bullock; caloric intake; Campylobacter; controlled study; Escherichia coli; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; ozone layer; priority journal; rumen microorganism; Salmonella; zoonosis; Administration, Oral; Animals; Campylobacter; Campylobacter Infections; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Chlorates; Escherichia coli Infections; Escherichia coli O157; Ethane; Fermentation; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Male; Methane; Nitroparaffins; Rumen; Salmonella; Salmonella Infections, Animal; Zoonoses; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Campylobacter; Escherichia coli; Salmonella",,"chlorate, 14866-68-3; methane, 74-82-8; nitroethane, 79-24-3; Chlorates; Ethane, 74-84-0; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitroparaffins; nitroethane, 79-24-3",,,,"Mead, P.S., Slutsker, L., Dietz, V., McCaig, L.F., Bresee, J.S., Shapiro, C., Food-related illness and death in the United States (1999) Emerg Inf Dis, 5, pp. 607-625; Vugia, D., Hadler, J., Chaves, S., Blythe, D., Smith, K., Morse, D., Preliminary FoodNet data on the incidence of foodborne illness-selected sites, United States, 2002 (2003) MMWR, 52, pp. 340-343; Potter, A.A., Klashinsky, S., Li, Y., Frey, E., Townsend, H., Rogan, D., Decreased shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 by cattle following vaccination with type III secreted proteins (2004) Vaccine, 22, pp. 362-369; Schamberger, G.P., Phillips, R.L., Jacobs, J.L., Diez-Gonzalez, F., Reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7 populations in cattle by addition of colicin E7-producing Escherichia coli to feed (2004) Appl Environ Microbiol, 70, pp. 6053-6060; Zhoa, T., Doyle, M.P., Harmon, B.G., Brown, C.A., Mueller, P.O.E., Parks, A.H., Reduction of carriage of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cattle by inoculation with probiotic bacteria (1998) J Clin Microbiol, 36, pp. 641-647; Zhoa, T., Tkalcic, S., Doyle, M.P., Harmon, B.G., Brown, C.A., Zhoa, P., Pathogenicity of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in neonatal calves and evaluation of fecal shedding by treatment with probiotic Escherichia coli (2003) J Food Prot, 66, pp. 924-930; Brashears, M.M., Galyean, M.L., Loneragan, G.H., Mann, J.E., Killinger-Mann, K., Prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and performance by beef feedlot cattle given lactobacillus direct-fed microbials (2003) J Food Prot, 66, pp. 748-754; Brashears, M.M., Jaroni, D., Trimble, J., Isolation, selection and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cattle (2003) J Food Prot, 66, pp. 355-363; Anderson, R.C., Callaway, T.R., Anderson, T.J., Kubena, L.F., Keith, N.K., Nisbet, D.J., Bactericidal effect of sodium chlorate on Escherichia coli concentrations in bovine ruminal and fecal concentrations in vivo (2002) Microb Ecol Health Dis, 14, pp. 24-29; Anderson, R.C., Carr, M.A., Miller, R.K., King, D.A., Carstens, G.E., Genovese, K.J., Effects of experimental chlorate preparations as feed and water supplements on Escherichia coli colonization and contamination of beef cattle and carcasses (2005) Food Microbiol, 22, pp. 439-447; Callaway, T.R., Anderson, R.C., Genovese, K.J., Poole, T.L., Anderson, T.J., Byrd, J.A., Sodium chlorate supplementation reduces Escherichia coli 0157:H7 populations in cattle (2002) J Anim Sci, 80, pp. 1683-1689; Fox, J.T., Anderson, R.C., Carstens, G.E., Miller, R.K., Jung, Y.S., McReynolds, J.L., Effect of nitrate adaption on the bactericidal activity of an experimental chlorate product against Escherichia coli in cattle (2005) Int J Appl Res Vet Med, 3, pp. 76-80; Anderson, R.C., Jung, Y.S., Genovese, K.J., McReynolds, J.L., Callaway, T.R., Edrington, T.S., Low level nitrate or nitroethane preconditioning enhances the bactericidal effect of suboptimal experimental chlorate treatment against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium but not Campylobacter in swine (2006) Foodborne Path Dis, 3, pp. 461-465; Miller, T.L., The ecology of methane production and hydrogen sinks in the rumen (1995) Ruminant physiology: digestion, metabolism, growth and reproduction, pp. 317-331. , Englehardt W.V., Leonhard-Marek S., Breves G., and Giesecke D.
