The model, which uses Boolean Algebra as its formal mathematical language, provides a qualitative insight into the long term morphodynamic behaviour of the estuarine system, at this level without the need for detailed and quantitative hydrodynamic and morphodynamic process knowledge or extensive data resources. The model predictions suggest that the long-term morphological changes in the Clyde Estuary largely depend on the fluvial flow of the River Clyde. Salt marshes in the upper reaches of the estuary were found to be the most vulnerable morphological feature of the estuary. In the event of increased river flow in the future, a likely situation according to climate change scenarios, saltmarshes will deplete or disappear altogether, irrespective of the sediment influx into the estuary. Changes to waves and tides will also contribute to the evolution by taking the estuary through significantly different intermediate morphological states whilst evolving towards a stable end state. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Boolean model;
