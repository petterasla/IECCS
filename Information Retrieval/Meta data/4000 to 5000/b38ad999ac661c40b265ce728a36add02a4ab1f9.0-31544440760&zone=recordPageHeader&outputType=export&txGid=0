Forests alleviate effects of global warming and absorb air pollutants as well. Essentially, forest management plays an important role in tackling environmental problems. Mapping exact position of trees in forest, which is one component of forest management, is not easy. Due to forests' complex structure and undergrowths, measuring works are difficult and take longer time by manual method. In this study, a ground-based remote sensing technique to estimate tree positions in forest has been developed using a portable imaging lidar. The lidar is a portable measuring instrument which uses near infra-red laser. The lidar system is only controlled by one man and measurements of tree positions only take a shorter time (i.e. about 8 minutes). Normally, natural trees do not grow straight and lean to other directions. In this case, the lidar can not directly measure the foot of the trees because of the undergrowths. Hence, the tree positions that were estimated from the center of the stem at measurable height (in most cases the measurable height is 2 m or more) are quite different from the actual tree position and the error is about 0.81 m in RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). A Hough transform method was therefore used to enable the measurement of leaning trees as well as those covered with thick undergrowths. By comparing the estimated tree positions using Hough transform and the manual measurements of 24 trees in about 1200 m2 Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis) forest, statistical results showed an accuracy of 0.16 m in RMSE.","Hough transform; Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis) forest; Portable imaging lidar; Remote sensing; Tree position","Larix; Larix kaempferi; Pseudolarix kaempferi",,,,,,"Avery, T.E., Burkhart, H.E., (1983) Forest Measurements, , McGraw-Hill.
