Several different production processes are currently used worldwide, and the magnesium production scenario is changing rapidly, with Chinese production increasingly dominating the world market. For the purpose of this paper, a novel approach to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied, in which Material Flow Accounting (MFA) and energy-based methods (Embodied Energy, Exergy Analysis and Emergy Synthesis) are integrated and complemented by a detailed description of the environmental hazards associated with emissions from all the different processes. Furthermore, the findings of the assessment are applied to estimate the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the Acidification Potential (AP) related to the world primary magnesium production in 2007, with an allocation to the producer countries. Results highlight the relevance in terms of environmental impact of the country where the Mg production process takes place, and clearly identify the dominating Chinese Pidgeon process as the least sustainable Mg production chain, despite its growing diffusion: it has the highest environmental burdens as well as material and energy consumption, and the lowest exergy efficiency. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental impact; LCA; Magnesium production; Primary metallic magnesium","Air pollution; Chemical reactions; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Estimation; Exergy; Global warming; Life cycle; Light metals; Magnesium; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Production engineering; Well stimulation; (e ,3e) process; Applied (CO); Automotive applications; Different processes; Elsevier (CO); Embodied energy; Emissions (asphalt); Energy based methods; Energy consumption; Environmental burdens; Environmental hazards; Exergy Analysis; Exergy efficiencies; Global-warming potential (GWP); Life cycle assessment (LCA)); Light weight alloys; magnesium production; Material flow accounting (MFA); Metallic magnesium; nove l approach; production chains; Production processes; Synthesis (of chiral ionic liquids); World markets; Magnesium printing plates; alloy; fuel; magnesium; acidification; energy use; environmental hazard; environmental impact; estimation method; fuel consumption; life cycle analysis; magnesium; acidification; article; diffusion; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; recycling; technology; thermal analysis; Air Pollution; Alloy; Energy Production; Environmental Regulations; Fuels; Life Cycle; Light Metals; Magnesium; Printing Plates; Production Engineering; Reaction Kinetics; Wells",,"magnesium, 7439-95-4",,,,"Baker, G.L., The Stanwell magnesium project (2001) Magnesium Ind, 5 (2001), pp. 18-24; Barcza, N., Freeman, M., Schoukens, A., Thermal magnesium: is it economically viable?
