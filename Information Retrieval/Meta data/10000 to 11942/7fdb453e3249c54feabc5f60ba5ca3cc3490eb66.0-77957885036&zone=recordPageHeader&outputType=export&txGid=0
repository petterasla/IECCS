Tools that allow these emissions to be placed on some kind of common scale in terms of their impact on climate have a number of possible uses such as: in agreements and emission trading schemes; when considering potential trade-offs between changes in emissions resulting from technological or operational developments; and/or for comparing the impact of different environmental impacts of transport activities.Many of the non-CO2 emissions from the transport sector are short-lived substances, not currently covered by the Kyoto Protocol. There are formidable difficulties in developing metrics and these are particularly acute for such short-lived species. One difficulty concerns the choice of an appropriate structure for the metric (which may depend on, for example, the design of any climate policy it is intended to serve) and the associated value judgements on the appropriate time periods to consider; these choices affect the perception of the relative importance of short- and long-lived species. A second difficulty is the quantification of input parameters (due to underlying uncertainty in atmospheric processes). In addition, for some transport-related emissions, the values of metrics (unlike the gases included in the Kyoto Protocol) depend on where and when the emissions are introduced into the atmosphere - both the regional distribution and, for aircraft, the distribution as a function of altitude, are important.In this assessment of such metrics, we present Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) as these have traditionally been used in the implementation of climate policy. We also present Global Temperature Change Potentials (GTPs) as an alternative metric, as this, or a similar metric may be more appropriate for use in some circumstances. We use radiative forcings and lifetimes from the literature to derive GWPs and GTPs for the main transport-related emissions, and discuss the uncertainties in these estimates. We find large variations in metric (GWP and GTP) values for NO. x, mainly due to the dependence on location of emissions but also because of inter-model differences and differences in experimental design. For aerosols we give only global-mean values due to an inconsistent picture amongst available studies regarding regional dependence. The uncertainty in the presented metric values reflects the current state of understanding; the ranking of the various components with respect to our confidence in the given metric values is also given. While the focus is mostly on metrics for comparing the climate impact of emissions, many of the issues are equally relevant for stratospheric ozone depletion metrics, which are also discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Global Temperature Change Potential (GTP); Global warming potential; GWP; Radiative forcing; Transport","Global temperature change; Global warming potential; GWP; Radiative forcings; Transport; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric temperature; Emission control; Environmental impact; Global warming; International law; Ozone; Ozone layer; Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric movements; carbon dioxide; aerosol; climate effect; emissions trading; environmental impact; environmental policy; global warming; Kyoto Protocol; operations technology; ozone depletion; radiative forcing; transportation infrastructure; transportation mode; aerosol; air pollution control; aircraft; altitude; article; atmosphere; chemical reaction; climate; climate change; gas transport; greenhouse effect; metric system; ozone depletion; physical parameters; priority journal; radiative forcing; stratosphere; traffic and transport",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Aaheim, H.A., Fuglestvedt, J.S., Godal, O., Cost savings of a flexible multigas climate policy (2006) Energy Journal, pp. 485-502. , (special issue); Archer, D., Kheshgi, H., MaierReimer, E., Multiple timescales for neutralization of fossil fuel CO2 (1997) Geophysical Research Letters, 24, pp. 405-408; Berntsen, T.K., Fuglestvedt, J.S., Joshi, M.M., Shine, K.P., Stuber, N., Ponater, M., Sausen, R., Li, L., Climate response to regional emissions of ozone precursors: sensitivities and warming potentials (2005) Tellus, 57 B, pp. 283-304; Berntsen, T., Fuglestvedt, J., Myhre, G., Stordal, F., Berglen, T.F., Abatement of greenhouse gases: does location matter?
