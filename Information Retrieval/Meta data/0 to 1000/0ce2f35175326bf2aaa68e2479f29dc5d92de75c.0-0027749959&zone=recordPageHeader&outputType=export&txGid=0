These include Indonesia's performance to date in the international arena and its track record for compliance with agreements; domestic challenges such as demographic pressures, economic growth, deforestation, and energy consumption; the institutional culture of the government; and the activities and limitations of the legal system, non-governmental organizations, and business. The author concludes that, while the Indonesian government may be a vocal advocate for 'sustainable development', it has little ability to follow through on large-scale commitments to international efforts because of issues it faces at home. © 1993.",,"climatic change; developing country; environmental policy; global protection; participation opportunity; sustainable development; Indonesia",,,,,,"Sasmojo, Nawangsidi, (1991) Policy Reorientation for Effective Energy-Environment Integration in Asian Pacific Countries, , Center for Research on Energy, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, unpublished paper; Foundation for Research and Industrial Affiliation, Bandung Institute of Technology, Environmental Considerations in Energy Development Project, Indonesia Country Study (1991) Report No PPE/KLN/91/01-02 (LAPA-ITB), , prepared for the Asian Development Bank, TA 5357; Pandaya, Indonesia set to sign Montreal Protocol on environment (1992) The Jakarta Post; Bardach, (1988) Coastal Zone Activities and Sea Level Rise, , The East-West Center, Honolulu, HI; Western tourists urged to curb turtle slaughter (1991) The Jakarta Post; Office hampered in monitoring AMDAL progress (1992) The Jakarta Post; Air pollution threatens crops in Southeast Asia (1992) The Jakarta Post; NAM countries to take united stand on environmental issues (1992) The Jakarta Post; Feldman, (1988) Managing Global Climate Change Through International Cooperation: Lessons From Prior Resource Management Efforts, , Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, ORNL/TM010914; RI urged to play major role in global environment forum (1992) The Jakarta Post; Pandaya, Indonesia set to sign Montreal Protocol on environment (1992) The Jakarta Post; Western tourists urged to curb turtle slaughter (1991) The Jakarta Post; Korean businessman held for smuggling dried turtles (1991) The Jakarta Post; Western tourists urged to curb turtle slaughter (1991) The Jakarta Post; Turtles not endangered species in Bali: official (1991) The Jakarta Post; Ellis, Shells: The forgotten endangered species (1991) The Voice of Nature, 96, pp. 36-41; Ellis, Shells: The forgotten endangered species (1991) The Voice of Nature, 96, pp. 36-41; WALHI criticizes decree on endangered species (1991) The Jakarta Post; Difficulty reported in monitoring sale of protected species (1991) The Jakarta Post; Social indicators (1992) Far Eastern Economic Review, p. 14; Nurbaiti, Family planning objective: Choice or target?
