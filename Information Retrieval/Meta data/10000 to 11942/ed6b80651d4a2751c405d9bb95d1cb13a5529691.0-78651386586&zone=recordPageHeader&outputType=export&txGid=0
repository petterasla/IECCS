In the coming years, new regulations will set limits to emissions in specific areas and various technical countermeasures will be developed and implemented. However, when taking technical measures against emissions on a local scale, there is always a risk of inducing an increase in the total environmental impact related to the technology used, owing to increased energy use and emissions in other places. In the present study, an investigation of the difference in environmental impact from passenger transport vessels with and without catalytic NOx emission purification was performed in a life cycle assessment. The production and transport of chemicals used in the catalyst are included in the study. The study shows that the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) gives a considerable decrease in the environmental impact compared with using a diesel engine without a catalyst. The transport of urea solution over a 500 km distance makes a very small contribution to the total environmental impact. The global warming potential is the only impact category for which values are increased when including the urea production and transport. When looking at the contribution from urea to the total impact from the SCR process, the increase is less than 10 per cent for most impact categories. © Authors 2011.","life cycle assessment; nitrogen oxide emissions; removal of emissions; selective catalytic reduction; ship engine exhausts","Energy use; Engine exhaust; Global emissions; Global warming potential; Life-cycle assessments; Local scale; nitrogen oxide emissions; Nitrogen oxide removal; Passenger transport; SCR process; Specific areas; Technical countermeasures; Technical measures; Urea production; Urea solutions; Global warming potential; Land-based sources; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Nitrogen oxide emissions; Nitrogen oxide removal; Passenger transport; Technical countermeasures; Technical measures; Catalysts; Diesel engines; Environmental impact; Exhaust systems (engine); Global warming; Life cycle; Metabolism; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Rating; Reduction; Ships; Urea; Catalysts; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Engines; Environmental technology; Exhaust systems (engine); Global warming; Life cycle; Metabolism; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Risk assessment; Selective catalytic reduction; Ships; Urea; Selective catalytic reduction; Environmental impact",,,,,,"Cofala, J., Amann, M., Heyes, C., Wagner, F., Klimont, Z., Posch, M., Schöpp, W., Stavrakaki, A., Analysis of policy measures to reduce ship emissions in the context of the revision of the national emissions ceilings directive (2007) Report European Commission, Directorate General Environment, Unit ENV/C1, , (Contract 070501/2005/419589/MAR/C1) (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis Contract 06-107), April; (2008) Amendments to the Annex of the Protocol of 1997 to Amend the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, As Modified by the Protocol of 1978 Relating Thereto, , International Maritime Organization Resolution MEPC.176(58), Annex 13, Adopted on 10 October 2008 (Revised MARPOL Annex VI; (2008) Sjöfartsverkets Föreskrifter Om Farledsavgifter' (The Swedish Maritime Administration's Directive on Fair-way Dues), SJOFS, 5. , Swedish Maritime Administration (Sjöfartsverket) Norrköping, Sweden 2008; Lövblad, G., Fridell, E., Experiences from Use of Some Techniques to Reduce Emissions from Ships.
