Box 552, Johnston, I., United States","Plant physiologists have traditionally studied the relationship between crop performance (the phenotype) and the environment. Global change processes present multiple challenges to crop performance that can be met effectively by changing the crop environment through management, and by modifying the crop genome (the genotype) through plant breeding and molecular biology. In order to increase the reliability of crop performance prediction based upon genetic information, new tools are needed to more effectively relate observed phenotypes to genotypes. The emerging discipline of genomics offers promise of providing such tools, and may provide a unique opportunity to enhance genetic gains and stabilize global crop production. Genomics has developed from the confluence of genetics, automated laboratory tools for generating DNA- and RNA-based data, and methods of information management. Functional genomics concentrates on how genes function, alone and in networks, while structural genomics focuses on physical and structural aspects of the genome. The traditional strengths of physiology lie in interpreting whole plant response to environmental signals, dissecting traits into component processes, and predicting correlated responses when genes and pathways are perturbed. These complement information on the genetic control of signal transduction, gene expression, gene networks and candidate genes. Combining physiological and genetic information can provide a more complete model of gene-to-phenotype relationships and genotype-by- environment interactions. Phenotypic screening procedures that more accurately identify underlying genetic variation, and crop models that incorporate Mendelian genetic controls of key processes provide two tangible examples of fruitful collaboration between physiologists and geneticists. These point to a productive complementary relationship between disciplines that will speed progress towards stable and adequate food production, despite challenges posed by global climate change. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Breeding; Climate; Genomics; Modeling; Quantitative trait locus","Genotypes; Phenotypes; Climate change; Crops; DNA; Environmental protection; Physiology; Plants (botany); RNA; Genetic engineering; breeding; genome; global change; modeling; physiology",,,,,,"Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 796-815; Baenziger, P.S., McMaster, G.S., Wilhelm, W.W., Weiss, A., Hays, C.J., Putting genes into genetic coefficients (2004) Field Crops Res., 90, pp. 133-143; Blum, A., Towards standard assays of drought resistance in crop plants.
