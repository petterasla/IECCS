Species diapausing in a feeding stage and accumulating metabolic reserves during permissive pre-wintering conditions are expected to enter diapause shortly before the onset of winter. In contrast, species diapausing in a non-feeding stage are expected to lower their metabolism as soon as possible to avoid excessive consumption of metabolic reserves. The solitary bee Osmia lignaria winters as a non-feeding adult within its cocoon, but previous studies show important weight losses and increased winter mortality in populations pre-wintered for extended periods. We measured respiration rates to assess diapause initiation and maintenance during pre-wintering, and tested whether timing of adult eclosion affected fitness by measuring fat body depletion, winter mortality and post-winter longevity. We worked with different cohorts of a population reared under natural conditions, and manipulated pre-wintering duration in a population reared under artificial conditions. In agreement with our expectation, O. lignaria lower their metabolic rates within a few days of adult eclosion, but nonetheless suffer strong weight loss during pre-wintering. Early developing individuals suffer greater weight loss and fat body depletion, and have short post-winter longevity. Although, we found no differences in winter mortality among treatments, our results indicate that increased mortality may occur in years with late winter arrivals. We discuss fundamental ecophysiological differences between adult and prepupal diapause within the Megachilidae, and hypothesize that species wintering as adults will be more negatively affected by a situation of extended summers under a scenario of global warming. © 2010.","Climate change; Diapause ecophysiology; Fat body; Global warming; Life cycle phenology; Megachilidae; Respirometry; Winter survival","adult; bee; body mass; cocoon; cohort analysis; diapause; ecophysiology; emergence; fitness; global warming; life cycle; longevity; metabolism; mortality; phenology; seasonal variation; weight; animal; article; bee; body weight; cohort analysis; fat body; female; growth, development and aging; male; metamorphosis; oxygen consumption; physiology; season; temperature; time; Animals; Bees; Body Weight; Cohort Studies; Fat Body; Female; Male; Metamorphosis, Biological; Oxygen Consumption; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Apoidea; Hexapoda; Megachilidae; Osmia lignaria",,,,,,"Adedokun, T.A., Denlinger, D.L., Cold-hardiness: a component of the diapause syndrome in pupae of the flesh flies, Sarcophaga crassipalpis and S. bullata (1984) Physiological Entomology, 9, pp. 361-364; Bale, J.S., Herbivory in global change research: direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 1-16; Bale, J.S., Hayward, S.A.L., Insect overwintering in a changing climate (2010) The Journal of Experimental Biology, 213, pp. 980-994; Baltensweiler, W., Why the larch bud-moth cycle collapsed in the sub-Alpine larch-cembran pine forests in the year 1990 for the first time since 1850 (1993) Oecologia, 94, pp. 62-66; Bosch, J., Improvement of field management of Osmia cornuta (Latreille) (Hymenoptera Megachilidae) (1994) Apidologie, 25, pp. 71-83; Bosch, J., Production of under-sized offspring in a solitary bee (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 809-816; Bosch, J., Kemp, W.P., Development and emergence of the orchard pollinator, Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) (2000) Environmental Entomology, 29, pp. 8-13; Bosch, J., Kemp, W.P., Effect of wintering duration and temperature on survival and emergence time in males of the orchard pollinator Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) (2003) Environmental Entomology, 32, pp. 711-716; Bosch, J., Kemp, W.P., Effect of pre-wintering and wintering temperature regimes on weight loss, survival, and emergence time in the mason bee Osmia cornuta (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) (2004) Apidologie, 35, pp. 469-479; Bosch, J., Vicens, N., Body size as an estimator of production costs in a solitary bee (2002) Ecological Entomology, 27, pp. 129-137; Bosch, J., Vicens, N., Relationship between body size, provisioning rate, longevity and reproductive success in females of the solitary bee Osmia cornuta (2006) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 60, pp. 26-33; Bosch, J., Kemp, W.P., Peterson, S.S., Management of Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) populations for almond pollination: methods to advance bee emergence (2000) Environmental Entomology, 29, pp. 874-883; Bosch, J., Maeta, Y., Rust, R.W., A phylogenetic analysis of nesting behavior in the genus Osmia (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) (2001) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 94, pp. 617-627; Bosch, J., Kemp, W.P., Trostle, G.E., Bee population returns and cherry yields in an orchard pollinated with Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) (2006) Journal of Economic Entomology, 99, pp. 408-413; Bradshaw, W.E., Armbruster, P.A., Holzapfel, C.M., Fitness consequences of hibernal diapause in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1458-1462; Bradshaw, W.E., Holzapfel, C.M., Insects at not so low temperature: climate change in the temperate zone and its biotic consequences (2010) Low Temperature Biology of Insects, pp. 242-275. , Cambridge University Press, D.L.
