Hereupon, low-carbon technologies for the iron reduction process draw much attention from both academia and industries. At sufficiently high temperature, it is reported that an arc plasma torch system has a higher reduction power compared to the conventional system which uses coke for iron reduction. In this paper, we have studied the arc plasma torch system for the iron production with low-carbon emission; hydrogen is added to the plasma-forming gas to realize the reduction atmosphere; a furnace, composed of a graphite crucible and a refractory wall, is designed to control the process conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and surrounding gas in a water-cooled chamber. The relations between the iron production and the carbon dioxide emission are investigated at various operating conditions of input power, gas flow rate and hydrogen mole fraction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
