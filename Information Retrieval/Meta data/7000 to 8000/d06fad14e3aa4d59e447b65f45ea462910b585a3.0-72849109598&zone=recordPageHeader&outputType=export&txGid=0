The mitigation of these emissions could have a significant near-term effect on slowing global warming, and recovering and burning the methane would allow a wasted energy resource to be exploited. The typically low and fluctuating energy content of the emission streams makes combustion difficult; however porous burners - an advanced combustion technology capable of burning low-calorific value fuels below the conventional flammability limit - are one possible mitigation solution. Here we discuss a pilot-scale porous burner designed for this purpose. The burner comprises a cylindrical combustion chamber filled with a porous bed of alumina saddles,combined with an arrangement of heat exchanger tubes for preheating the incoming emission stream. A computational fluid dynamics model was developed to aid in the design process. Results illustrating the burner's stable operating range and behavior are presented: stable ultralean combustion is demonstrated at natural gas concentrations as low as 2.3 vol%, with transient combustion at concentrations down to 1.1 vol%; the system is comparatively stable to perturbations in the operating conditions, and emissions of both carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons are negligible. Based on this pilotscale demonstration, porous burners show potential as a methane mitigation technology. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Combustion technology; Computational fluid dynamics models; Design process; Flammability limits; Fluctuating energy; Heat exchanger tube; Methane emissions; Methane mitigation; Operating condition; Operating ranges; Pilot scale; Porous bed; Porous burners; Ultra-lean; Unburned hydrocarbons; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Combustion chambers; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy resources; Explosives; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Smoke; Leakage (fluid); aluminum oxide; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; methane; natural gas; anthropogenic source; burning; carbon monoxide; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (composition); emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; technological development; article; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (parameters); heat exchange; heating; pilot study; porosity; porous burner; temperature; tube; Air Pollutants; Animals; Ceramics; Computer Simulation; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Incineration; Materials Testing; Methane; Models, Chemical; Refuse Disposal; Temperature",,"aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; methane, 74-82-8; natural gas, 8006-14-2; Air Pollutants; Ceramics; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"(2006) Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990-2020, , EPA 430-R-06-003; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Washington, DC; (2007) Climate Change 2007: the Physical Science Basis, , Solomon, S., Qin, D., Manning, M., Chen, Z., Marquis, M., Averyt, K.
