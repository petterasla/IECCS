Nitrogen fertilizer is also a source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. The recent analysis of carbon sequestration in cropland soils of China does not apply these 'discounts' to the global warming mitigation expected from greater use of fertilizer; doing so would likely eliminate all the climate benefits of the postulated enhanced carbon sequestration. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agriculture; Carbon sequestration; China; Fertilizer; Soil organic matter","agricultural land; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; fertilizer application; global warming; mitigation; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil carbon; soil organic matter; China",,,,,,"Jassal, R.S., Black, T.A., Chen, B., Roy, R., Nesic, Z., Spittlehouse, D.L., Trofymow, J.A., N 2O emissions and carbon sequestration in a nitrogen-fertilized Douglas fir stand (2009) Journal of Geophysical Research, 113. , doi: 10.1029/2008JG000764; Lu, F., Wang, X., Han, B., Quyang, Z., Duan, X., Zheng, H., Miao, H., Soil carbon sequestrations by nitrogen fertilizer application, straw return and no-tillage in China's cropland (2009) Global Change Biology, 15, pp. 281-305; Pan, G.X., Smith, P., Pan, W.N., The role of soil organic matter in maintaining the productivity and yield stability of cereals in China (2009) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 129, pp. 344-348; Robertson, G.P., Paul, E.A., Harwood, R.R., Greenhouse gases in intensive agriculture: contributions of individual gases to the radiative forcing of the atmosphere (2000) Science, 289, pp. 1922-1925; Schlesinger, W.H., Carbon sequestration in soils: some cautions amidst optimism (2000) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 82, pp. 121-127; Schlesinger, W.H., On the fate of anthropogenic nitrogen (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 106, pp. 203-208; West, T.O., Marland, G., A synthesis of carbon sequestration, carbon emissions, and net carbon flux in agriculture: comparing tillage practices in the United States.
