In this paper we explore potential climatic factors governing the recent establishment of new palm populations far to the north of any other viable palm population in the world. Location: Southern Switzerland, Europe, Asia and the world. Methods: Weidentified ecological threshold values for the target species, Trachycarpus fortunei, based on gridded climate data, altitude and distributional records from the native range and applied them to the introduced range using local field monitoring and measured meteorological data as well as a bioclimatic model. Results: We identified a strong relationship between minimum winter temperatures, influenced by growing season length and the distribution of the palm in its native range. Recent climate change strongly coincides with the palm's recent spread into southern Switzerland, which is in concert with the expansion of the global range of palms across various continents. Main conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that the expansion of palms into (semi-)natural forests is driven by changes in winter temperature and growing season length and not by delayed population expansion. This implies that this rapid expansion is likely to continue in the future under a warming climate. Palms in general, and T. fortunei in particular, are significant bioindicators across continents for present-day climate change and reflect a global signal towards warmer conditions. © 2007 The AuthorsJournal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Arecaceae; Biogeography; Bioindicator; Exotic species; Global warming; Invasion; Northernmost palm population; Ticino; Trachycarpus fortunei; Vegetation shift","biogeography; bioindicator; climate change; geographical distribution; global warming; range expansion; tree; Asia; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland; Ticino; Arecaceae; Trachycarpus fortunei",,,,,,"Anten, N.P.R., Martinez-Ramos, M., Ackerly, D.D., Compensatory growth in a tropical understorey palm subjected to repeated defoliation events (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 2905-2918; Beerling, D.J., Huntley, B., Bailey, J.P., Climate and the distribution of Fallopia japonica: Use of an introduced species to test the predictive capacity of response surfaces (1995) Journal of Vegetation Science, 6, pp. 269-282; Begert, M., Schlegel, T., Kirchhofer, W., Homogeneous temperature and precipitation series of Switzerland from 1864 to 2000 (2005) International Journal of Climatology, 25, pp. 65-80; Berger, S., Walther, G.-R., Distribution of evergreen broad-leaved woody species in Insubria in relation to bedrock and precipitation (2006) Botanica Helvetica, 116, pp. 65-77; Bisgrove, R., Hadley, P., Gardening in the global greenhouse: The impacts of climate change on gardens in the UK (2002), Technical Report.
