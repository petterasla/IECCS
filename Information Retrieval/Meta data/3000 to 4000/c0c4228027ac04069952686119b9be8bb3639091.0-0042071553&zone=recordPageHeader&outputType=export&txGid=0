Manufacturing the wood floor required 1.6 times more energy and produced one-third of the GHG emissions compared with the natural stone floor. Over the life cycle, net GHG emissions can be avoided only if the wood is used as a biofuel after the replacement or demolition of the floor. The wooden floor must be competitive on price to be a cost-efficient action against global warming. Per cubic metre of wood floor, emissions of up to 1.263 t of CO2 equivalents can be avoided by a substitution between the two floor constructions. The factors that have the most influence on the result are carbon fixation on forest land, waste handling of wood, and discount rate, the latter reflecting the relative importance over time given to a unit of GHG emissions.",,"Cost effectiveness; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Rocks; Wooden construction; Natural stones; Floors; building stone; construction material; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; wood; Norway; Quercus",,,,,,"Apneseth, T., (1997) Environmental Declaration of Products from the Wood Industry, Main Report.
