Biodiesel is emerging as one of the possible solutions for the transport sector. It shows comparable engine performance to that of conventional diesel fuel, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the toxicity of products and effluents from the biodiesel industry has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Brazil has a very high potential as a biodiesel producer, in view of its climatic conditions and vast areas for cropland, with consequent environmental risks because of possible accidental biodiesel spillages into water bodies and runoff to coastal areas. This research determined the toxicity to two marine organisms of the water-soluble fractions (WSF) of three different biodiesel fuels obtained by methanol transesterification of castor oil (CO), palm oil (PO), and waste cooking oil (WCO). Microalgae and sea urchins were used as the test organisms, respectively, for culture-growth-inhibition and early-life-stage-toxicity tests. The toxicity levels of the analyzed biodiesel WSF showed the highest toxicity for the CO, followed by WCO and the PO. Methanol was the most prominent contaminant; concentrations increased over time in WSF samples stored up to 120 d. © 2010 SETAC © 2010 SETAC.","Biodiesel; Marine; Methanol; Risk evaluation; Toxicity","Bio-diesel fuel; Biodiesel industry; Castor oil; Climatic conditions; Coastal area; Energy demands; Engine performance; Environmental risks; High potential; Marine; Marine organisms; Micro-algae; Palm oil; Possible solutions; Renewable sources; Risk evaluation; Sea urchin; Test organisms; Toxicity test; Transport sectors; Waste cooking oil; Water soluble fraction; Waterbodies; Coastal zones; Diesel fuels; Effluents; Exhaust systems (engine); Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Machine design; Mammals; Marine biology; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Renewable energy resources; Synthetic fuels; Toxicity; Vegetable oils; Biodiesel; biodiesel; castor oil; methanol; palm oil; agricultural land; biofuel; diesel engine; echinoderm; energy use; environmental risk; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; growth rate; inhibition; life cycle; marine pollution; methanol; microalga; oil spill; performance assessment; risk assessment; runoff; toxicity; toxicity test; vegetable oil; article; Brazil; embryo development; environmental factor; fungus growth; IC 50; life cycle assessment; marine environment; microalga; nonhuman; priority journal; sea urchin; toxicity testing; transesterification; water contamination; Animals; Biofuels; Castor Oil; Chlorophyta; Cooking; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Plant Oils; Sea Urchins; Solubility; Waste Products; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Brazil; Echinoidea; Elaeis",,"castor oil, 8001-79-4; methanol, 67-56-1; palm oil, 8002-75-3; Biofuels; Castor Oil, 8001-79-4; Plant Oils; Waste Products; Water Pollutants, Chemical; palm oil, 8002-75-3",,,,"(2007), pp. p 52. , IPIntergovernmental Panel of Climate Change.
