The debate on global climate change is no exception. This paper sketches and analyses the welfare foundations of cost-benefit analysis and from this perspective analyses the role of cost-benefit analysis in the climate policy debate, particularly with reference to intergenerational effects. The paper concludes that the cost-benefit criterion cannot provide a definitive basis for deciding whether we should commit to a longer-term programme to moderate climate change; the issues of intergenerational equity are not that global climate change will significantly lower the GNP of future generations, but relate to the possibility of science fiction-like changes in the planet that will produce catastrophic effects in the future; and the typical way in which the cost-benefit problem is posed obscures the basic choices that we should be evaluating. © 1995.","Discounting; Global warming; Intergenerational equity","climate change; climatic change; cost/benefit analysis; environmental economics; environmental policy; global climate policy; global warming; GNP; inter-generational equity; policy making",,,,,,"Birdsall, Steer, Act now on global warming: but don't cook the books (1993) Finance and Development, 30 (1); Cline, W R ‘Give greenhouse abatement a fair chance’ Finance and Development 30 (1) 3–5Cropper, Portney, (1992) Discounting Human Lives, , Resources for the Future, Washington, DC; Dasgupta, Resource depletion, R&D, and the social rate of discount (1982) Discounting for Time and Risk in Energy Policy, , RC Lind, KL Arrow, GR Corey, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD; Dixit, Pyndyck, (1994) Investment Under Uncertainty, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Lind, A primer on the major issues relating to the discount rate for evaluating national energy options (1982) Discounting for Time and Risk in Energy Policy, , RC Lind, KL Arrow, GR Corey, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD; Lind, Reassessing the government's discount rate policy in light of new theory and data in a world economy with a high degree of capital mobility (1990) Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 18 (2), pp. S20-S21; Nordaus, Reflections on the economics of climate change (1993) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 7 (4), pp. 11-25; Rebelo, Transitional dynamics and economic growth in the neoclassical model (1993) American Economic Review, 83 (4), pp. 908-931; Samuelson, An exact consumption-loan model of interest without the social convenience of money (1958) Journal of Political Economy, 36 (4), pp. 467-482; Wallace, Discounting our Descendants (1993) Finance and Development, 30 (1), p. 2; Weitzman, Newey, Rabin, Sequential R&D strategy for synfuels (1981) The Bell Journal of Economics, 12 (2), pp. 574-590","Lind, R.C.; Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, 562 Malot Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029508131
