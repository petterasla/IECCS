The concentrations of atmospheric CFC-11 at Kosan have decreased slightly, at a rate of -2.5 pptv yr-1, over the period in response to the Montreal Protocol. The CFC-12 mixing ratio at Kosan continues to increase in the atmosphere at a rate of 5.7 pptv yr-1 despite international regulations, because of its extreme atmosphere persistence. Recent trends of these two chlorofluorocarbons at Kosan, Korea were concordant with those of the northern hemispheric background monitored unit at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The maximum seasonal mean mixing ratios of CFC-11 and CFC-12 at Kosan, Korea, were 270±4 pptv in the spring and 538±9 pptv in the winter, and the corresponding seasonal minima were 267±7 and 529±12 pptv. This occurred in the summer and was due to southeasterly winds from the northwestern Pacific Ocean. By performing a three-day isentropic backward trajectory analysis, it was shown that air masses at Kosan, and with the exception of summer, mainly originated from central and northern China. In particular, the mixing ratios of these two contaminant species are closely related with their air mass trajectories.","Cfc-11; Cfc-12; Global warming; Stratospheric ozone depletion; Trajectory","Chlorofluorocarbons; Ozone; Upper atmosphere; Ozone depletion; Global warming; chlorofluorocarbon; ozone; background level; CFC; global warming; long range transport; monitoring; ozone depletion; article; atmospheric transport; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; Korea; ozone layer; Pacific Ocean; seasonal variation; summer; wind; winter; Air Movements; Air Pollutants; China; Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane; Environmental Monitoring; Korea; Reference Values; Seasons; Korea; Loa; Mauna",,"Air Pollutants; Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane; dichlorodifluoromethane, 75-71-8; trichlorofluoromethane, 75-69-4",,,,"Cho, H.M., Park, M.K., Nam, J.C., Min, D.H., Kim, K.R., Song, B.H., Kim, B.S., Chong, Y.S., 'Trends of background concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in Korea' (1995) J.
