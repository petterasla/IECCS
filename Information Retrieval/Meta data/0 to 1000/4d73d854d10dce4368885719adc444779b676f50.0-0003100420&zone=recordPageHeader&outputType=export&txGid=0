Application of the method is demonstrated by deriving inversion frequencies from general circulation model (GCM) data sets. Daily midday radiosonde data at Cape Town International airport for the winter of 1989 were classified in a binary manner for the identification of temperature inversions, and an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to relate sea-level pressure fields over Cape Town to local inversion conditions. ANNs were used to derive the relationships because of their robustness in the presence of noise and because they do not have the constraints of linearity. These relationships were then applied to the simulations generated by two GCMs, the GISS and GENESIS models, in order to investigate their ability to represent the synoptic controls on local inversions. The two GCMs compared favourably with each other and were reasonably similar to the NMC's observational data regarding the number of temperature inversions each reflected. Following this, circulation for a simulation of doubled atmospheric CO2 was used to predict possible future changes in the frequency of inversions over Cape Town. The occurrence of temperature inversions increased by approximately 25% using the GISS model and by 33% using GENESIS. This putative increase in inversion frequency as a result of global climate change could have implications for the city's atmospheric pollution.",,,,,,,,"Karl, T.R., Wang, W.-C., Schlesinger, M.E., Knight, R.W., Portman, D., A method of relating General Circulation Model simulated climate to the observed local climate.
