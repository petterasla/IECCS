To accurately predict the future response of vegetation to climate variation, a thorough understanding of vegetation phenological cycles and their relationship to temperature and precipitation is required. In this paper, vegetation phenological transition dates identified using data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in 2001 are linked with MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data from the northern hemisphere between 35°N and 70°N. The results show well-defined patterns dependent on latitude, in which vegetation greenup gradually migrates northward starting in March, and dormancy spreads southward from late September. Among natural vegetation land-cover types, the growing-season length for forests is strongly correlated with variation in mean annual LST. For urban areas, the onset of greenup is 4-9 days earlier on average, and the onset of dormancy is about 2-16 days later, relative to adjacent natural vegetation. This difference (especially for urban vs. forests) is apparently related to urban heat island effects that result in both the average spring temperature and the mean annual temperature in urban areas being about 1-3°C higher relative to rural areas. The results also indicate that urban heat island effects on vegetation phenology are stronger in North America than in Europe and Asia. Finally, the onset of forest greenup at continental scales can be effectively described using a thermal time-chilling model, which can be used to infer the delay or advance of greenup onset in relation to climatic warming at global scale. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Land surface temperature; MODIS; Phenology model; Urban heat island; Vegetation phenology","climate change; global warming; heat island; phenology; remote sensing; vegetation dynamics",,,,,,"Beaubien, E.G., Freeland, H.J., Spring phenology trends in Alberta, Canada: Links to ocean temperature (2000) Internal Journal of Biometeorol, 44, pp. 53-59; Bonnan, G., (2002) Ecological Climatology - Concepts and Applications, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Botta, A., Viovy, N., Ciais, P., A global prognostic scheme of leaf onset using satellite data (2000) Global Change Biology, 6, pp. 709-725; Cannell, M.G.R., Murray, M.B., Sheppard, L.J., Forest avoidance by selection for late budburst in Picea Sitchensis (1985) Journal of Applied Ecology, 22, pp. 931-941; Cannell, M.G.R., Smith, R.I., Thermal time, chill days and prediction of budburst in Picea sitchensis (1983) Journal of Applied Ecology, 20, pp. 951-963; Cannell, M.G.R., Smith, R.I., Climatic warming spring budbursts, and forest damage on trees (1986) Journal of Applied Ecology, 23, pp. 177-191; Chmielewski, F.-M., Rötzer, T., Response of tree phenology to climate change across Europe (2001) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 180, pp. 101-112; Duchemin, B., Goubier, J., Courrier, G., Monitoring phenological key stages and cycle duration of temperate deciduous forest ecosystems with NOAA/AVHRR data (1999) Remote Sensing of Environment, 67, pp. 68-82; Emberlin, J., Detandt, M., Gehrig, R., Responses in the start of Betula (birch) pollen seasons to recent changes in spring temperatures across Europe (2002) International Journal of Biometeorology, 46, pp. 159-170; Fisher, A., A model for the seasonal variations of vegetation indices in coarse resolution data and its inversion to extract crop parameters (1994) Remote Sensing of Environment, 48, pp. 220-230; Fitter, A.H., Filtter, R.S.R., Harris, I.T.B., Relationship between first flowering date and temperature in the flora of a locality in central England (1995) Functional Ecology, 9, pp. 55-60; Fitzjarrald, D.R., Acevedo, O.C., Moore, K.E., Climatic consequences of leaf presence in the eastern United States (2001) Journal of Climate, 14, pp. 598-614; Franken, E., Der Beginn der Forsythienbluete in Hamberg 1955 (1955) Meteorologische Rundschau, 8, pp. 113-115; Friedl, M.A., McIver, D.K., Hodges, J.C.F., Global land cover mapping from MODIS: Algorithms and early results (2002) Remote Sensing of Environment, 83, pp. 287-302; Goward, S.N., Markham, B., Dye, D.G., Normalized difference vegetation index measurements from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (1991) Remote Sensing of Environment, 35, pp. 257-277; Gutzler, D.S., Rosen, R.D., Internal variability of wintertime snow cover across the northern-hemisphere (1992) Journal of Climate, 5, pp. 1441-1447; Hänninen, H., Hkkinen, R., Hari, P., Timing of growth cessation in relation to climatic adaptation of northern woody plants (1990) Tree Physiology, 6, pp. 29-39; Hansen, J., Ruedy, R., Glascoe, J., GISS analysis of surface temperature change (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres, 104, pp. 30997-31022; Hopkins, A.D., Bioclimatics - A science of life and climate relations (1938) US Department of Agriculture Misc, , Publication No. 280.
