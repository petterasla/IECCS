It is generally attributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect, resulting from higher levels of trapped heat radiation by increasing atmospheric concentrations of gases such as CO2 (carbon dioxide). Much of these gases originate from power plants and fossil fuel combustion. However, the fate of vast amounts of waste heat rejected into the environment has evaded serious scholarly research. While 1 kWh electricity generation in a typical condensing coal-fired power plant emits around 1 kg of CO2, it also puts about 2 kWh energy into the environment as low grade heat. For nuclear (fission) electricity the waste heat release per kWh is somewhat higher despite much lower CO2 releases. This paper evaluates the impact of waste heat rejection combined with CO2 emissions using Finland and California as case examples. The immediate effects of waste heat release from power production and radiative forcing by CO2 are shown to be similar. However, the long-term (hundred years) global warming by CO2-caused radiative forcing is about twenty-five times stronger than the immediate effects, being responsible for around 92% of the heat-up caused by electricity production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Thermal power plant; Waste heat","Atmospheric concentration; California; Coal-fired power plant; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Finland; Fossil fuel combustion; Global climate changes; Heat release; Heat-up; Low grade heat; Power production; Radiative forcings; Relative contribution; Scholarly research; Thermal power plants; Waste heat rejection; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Electric generators; Electricity; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Energy conversion; carbon dioxide; coal-fired power plant; combustion; concentration (composition); electricity generation; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; power plant; radiation balance; research work; waste; California; Finland; United States",,,,,,"Archer, D., Eby, M., Brovkin, V., Ridgwell, A., Cao, L., Mikolajewicz, U., Atmospheric lifetime of fossil fuel carbon dioxide (2009) Ann Rev Earth Planet Sci, 37, pp. 117-134; Block, A., Keuler, K., Schaller, E., Impacts of anthropogenic heat on regional climate patterns (2004) Geophysical Research Letters, 31 (L12211), p. 4; Blundell, S.J., Blundell, K.M., (2010) Concepts in thermal physics, , Oxford Univ.
