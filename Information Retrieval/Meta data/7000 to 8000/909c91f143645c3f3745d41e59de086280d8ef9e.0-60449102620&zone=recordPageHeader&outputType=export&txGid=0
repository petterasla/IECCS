Gene expression profiling via cDNA microarray was used to determine the extent to which one species of notothenioid, Trematomus bernacchii, has retained the ability to alter gene expression in response to heat stress. While an inability to up-regulate the expression of any size class of heat shock proteins (except for a 1.1-fold induction of the co-chaperone Hsp40) was observed, hundreds of additional genes, associated with a broad range of cellular processes, were responsive to heat. Many of these genes are associated with central aspects of the evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response (CSR), which plays a pivotal role in responding to physical and chemical stresses. The inability of T. bernacchii to mount a heat shock response underscores the potential susceptibility of this species to the effects of global warming. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Antarctic fish; Genomics; Heat stress","cold tolerance; DNA; environmental stress; evolution; gene expression; high temperature; perciform; Pisces; Trematomus bernacchii",,,,,,"Afonso, L.O.B., Hosoya, J., Osborne, J., Gamperl, A.K., Johnson, S., Lack of glucose and hsp70 responses in haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus (L.) subjected to handling and heat shock (2008) J Fish Biol, 72, pp. 157-167; Aldsworth, T.G., Sharman, R.L., Dodd, C.E., Bacterial suicide through stress (1999) Cell Mol Life Sci, 56, pp. 378-383; Bucciantini, M., Giannoni, E., Chiti, F., Baroni, F., Formigli, L., Zurdo, J., Taddel, N., Stefani, M., Inherent toxicity of aggregates implies a common mechanism for protein misfolding diseases (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 507-511; Buckley, B.A., Comparative environmental genomics in non-model species: Using heterologous hybridization to DNA-based microarrays (2007) J Exp Biol, 210, pp. 1602-1606; Buckley, B.A., Place, S.P., Hofmann, G.E., Regulation of heat shock genes in isolated hepatocytes from an Antarctic fish, Trematomus bernacchii (2004) J Exp Biol, 207, pp. 3649-3656; Buckley, B.A., Gracey, A.Y., Somero, G.N., The cellular response to heat stress in the goby Gillichthys mirabilis: A cDNA microarray and protein-level analysis (2006) J Exp Biol, 209, pp. 2660-2677; Cheng, C.H.C., Cziko, P.A., Evans, C.W., Non-hepatic origin of notothenioid antifreeze reveals pancreatic synthesis as common mechanism in polar fish freezing avoidance (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 10491-10496; Chernikov, A.V., Gudkov, S.V., Shtarkman, I.N., Bruskov, V.I., Oxygen effect in heat-induced DNA damage (2007) Biophysics, 52, pp. 185-190; Ciechanover, A., The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: On protein death and cell life (1998) EMBO J, 17, pp. 7151-7160; Clark, M.S., Clarke, A., Cockell, C.S., Convey, P., Detrich Iii, H.W., Fraser, K.P.P., Johnston, I.A., Rogers, A.D., Antarctic genomics (2004) Comp Funct Genom, 5, pp. 230-238; Clark, M.S., Fraser, K.P.P., Burns, G., Peck, L.S., The HSP70 heat shock response in the Antarctic fish Harpagifer antarcticus (2008) Polar Biol, 31, pp. 171-180; Clark, M.S., Fraser, K.P.P., Peck, L.S., Lack of an Hsp70 heat shock response in two Antarctic marine invertebrates (2008) Polar Biol, , doi 10.1007/s00300-008-0447-7; Coppes Petricorena, Z.L., Somero, G.N., Biochemical adaptations of notothenioid fishes: Comparisons between cold temperate South American and New Zealand species and Antarctic species (2007) Comp Biochem Physiol A, 147, pp. 799-807; Devries, A., Glycoproteins as biological antifreeze agents in Antarctic fishes (1971) Science, 172, pp. 1152-1155; Di Ciano, C., Nie, Z., Szaszi, K., Lewis, A., Uruno, T., Zhan, X., Rotstein, O.D., Kapus, A., Osmotic stress-induced remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton (2002) Am J Physiol Cell Physiol, 283, pp. 850-C865; Feder, M.E., Hofmann, G.E., Heat-shock proteins, molecular chaperones, and the stress response: Evolutionary and ecological physiology (1999) Annu Rev Physiol, 61, pp. 243-282; Fields, P.A., Somero, G.N., Hot spots in cold adaptation: Localized increases in conformational flexibility in lactate dehydrogenase A4 orthologs of Antarctic notothenioid fishes (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95, pp. 11476-11481; Fink, A.L., Chaperone-mediated protein folding (1999) Physiol Rev, 79, pp. 425-449; Gasch, A.P., Spellman, P.T., Kao, C.M., Carmel-Harel, O., Eisen, M.B., Storz, G., Botstein, D., Brown, P.O., Genomic expression programs in the response of yeast cells to environmental change (2000) Mol Biol Cell, 11, pp. 4241-4257; Gracey, A.Y., Interpreting physiological responses to environmental change through gene expression profiling (2007) J Exp Biol, 210, pp. 1584-1592; Gracey, A.Y., The Gillichthys mirabilis Cooper array: A platform to investigate the molecular basis of phenotypic plasticity (2008) J Fish Biol, 72, pp. 2118-2132; Gracey, A.Y., Cossins, A.R., Application of microarray technology in environmental and comparative physiology (2003) Annu Rev Physiol, 65, pp. 231-259; Gracey, A.Y., Troll, J.V., Somero, G.N., Hypoxia-induced gene expression profiling in the euryoxic fish Gillichthys mirabilis (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 98, pp. 1993-1998; Gracey, A.Y., Fraser, E.J., Li, W., Fang, Y., Taylor, R.R., Rogers, J., Brass, A., Cossins, A.R., Coping with cold: An integrative, multitissue analysis of the transcriptome of a poikilothermic vertebrate (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101, pp. 16970-16975; Hazel, J., Thermal adaptation in biological membranes: Is homeoviscous adaptation the explanation?
