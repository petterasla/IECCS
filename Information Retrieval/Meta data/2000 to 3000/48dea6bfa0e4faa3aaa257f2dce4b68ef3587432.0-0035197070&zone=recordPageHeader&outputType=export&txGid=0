Hydrogen and electricity could team to provide attractive options in transportation and power generation. Interconversion between these two forms of energy suggests on-site utilization of hydrogen to generate electricity, with the electrical power grid serving in energy transportation, distribution utilization, and hydrogen regeneration as needed. A challenging problem in establishing H2 as a source of energy for the future is the renewable and environmentally friendly generation of large quantities of H2 gas. Thus, processes that are presently conceptual in nature, or at a developmental stage in the laboratory, need to be encouraged, tested for feasibility, and otherwise applied toward commercialization.",,"air pollution; alternative energy; bioconversion; electricity; energy production; environmental monitoring; hydrogen; Algae; Direct energy conversion; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Renewable energy resources; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen fuels; Algae, Green; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Chloroplasts; Electricity; Energy-Generating Resources; Hydrogen; Hydrogenase; Iron-Sulfur Proteins; Light; Oxygen; Photosynthesis; Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins; Water; algae; Chlorophyta; Eukaryota",,"Hydrogen, 1333-74-0; Hydrogenase, EC 1.18.99.1; iron hydrogenase, EC 1.12.-; Iron-Sulfur Proteins; Oxygen, 7782-44-7; Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Adams, M.W.W., The structure and mechanism of iron-hydrogenases (1990) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1020, pp. 115-145; Adams, M.W.W., Stiefel, E.I., Organometallic iron: The key to biological hydrogen metabolism (2000) Curr Opin Chem Biol, 4, pp. 214-220; Akhmanova, A., Voncken, F., Van Alen, T., Van Hoek, A., Boxma, B., Vogels, G., Veenhuis, M., Hackstein, J.H., A hydrogenosome with a genome (1998) Nature, 396, pp. 527-528; Bamberger, E.S., King, D., Erbes, D.L., Gibbs, M., H2 and CO2 evolution by anaerobically adapted Chlamydomonas reinhardtii F60 (1982) Plant Physiol, 69, pp. 1268-1273; Bui, E.T., Johnson, P.J., Identification and characterization of Fe-hydrogenases in the hydrogenosome of Trichomonas vaginalis (1996) Mol Biochem Parasitol, 76, pp. 305-310; Davies, J.P., Yildiz, F., Grossman, A.R., Sac1, a putative regulator that is critical for survival of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during sulfur deprivation (1996) EMBO J, 15, pp. 2150-2159; Florin, L., Tsokoglou, A., Happe, T., A novel type of Fe-hydrogenase in the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus is linked to the photosynthetical electron transport chain (2001) J Biol Chem, 276, pp. 6125-6132; Gaffron, H., Reduction of CO2 with H2 in green plants (1939) Nature, 143, pp. 204-205; Gaffron, H., Photosynthesis, photoreduction and dark reduction of carbon dioxide in certain algae (1944) Biol Rev Cambridge Philos Soc, 19, pp. 1-20; Gaffron, H., Rubin, J., Fermentative and photochemical production of hydrogen in algae (1942) J Gen Physiol, 26, pp. 219-240; Gfeller, R.P., Gibbs, M., Fermentative metabolism of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: I.
