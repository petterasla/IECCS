The resulting assessment indicates that an increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation could have a major negative impact on agriculture and water supplies in Saudi Arabia. To find signs of climatic change in Saudi Arabia a preliminary assessment of systematic changes in temperature and precipitation was made, based on the records of four Saudi weather stations. The analysis of this data, which dates back to 1961, shows no discernable signs of climatic change during the study period. Such data is, however, limited both spatially and temporally and cannot provide conclusive evidence to confirm climatic changes projected by GCMs. Nevertheless, in the light of recent climatic conditions and rapid population growth, Saudi decision-makers are urged to adopt a 'no regret' policy. Ideally, such a policy would include measures to avoid future environmental or socioeconomic problems that may occur in the event of significant climatic change.",,"Agriculture; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Thermal effects; Water resources; Precipitation; Global warming; agriculture; climate change; general circulation model; global warming; water resource; Saudi Arabia",,,,,,"Al-Hassoun, S.A., Prediction of the effect of pumping on Al-Wasia well field (1997) J.
