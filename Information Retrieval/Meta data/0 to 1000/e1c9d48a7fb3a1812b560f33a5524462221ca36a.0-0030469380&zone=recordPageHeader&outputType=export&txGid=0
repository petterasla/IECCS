The hypothesis tested was that the tradeoff phenomenon is masked by warm weather. When data for 20 years were pooled, there was no correlation. However, when years were analysed separately, a negative correlation was observed for five of the years. Over 12 years, the correlation coefficient between egg size and clutch size was not significant, and for 3 years it was significantly positive. The size and magnitude of the correlation were related to temperature during the pre-laying and egg-laying periods. Of the annual variation, 34% was explained by the mean temperature in early summer. It is suggested that trade-off between egg size and clutch size may not be apparent in central (southern) parts of the distribution area of the species where climate is warmer. In the future, global warming may alter reproductive strategies of birds. Long-term data may thus be useful in the analysis of such effects and in testing of theoretical questions in ecology.",,"Aves; Ficedula hypoleuca",,,,,,"Bell, G., Koufopanou, V., The cost of reproduction (1986) Oxford Surveys of Evolutionary Biology, 3, pp. 83-131. , Dawkins, R. & Ridley, M.
