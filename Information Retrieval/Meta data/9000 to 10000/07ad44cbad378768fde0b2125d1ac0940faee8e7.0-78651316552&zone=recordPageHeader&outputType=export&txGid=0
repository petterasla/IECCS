These can cause outburst floods that spread destruction far through the mountains and into the lowlands. More than 90 out-bursts from impoundments behind such dams have been identified. Of the largest and most destructive, 17 were on the upper Indus River and 10 on the Yarkand. Unlike ""dangerous lakes"" recently reported elsewhere in the Himalaya, these events are associated with advancing glaciers, in some cases glacial surges. The lakes are short-lived, rarely surviving more than one summer. Their outburst styles and flood waves exhibit distinctive features. This paper summarizes the behavior and current status of advances of more than a dozen glaciers with histories of large impoundments. Recent developments are assessed in relation to historical records and the Karakoram glacier environment. Destructive outburst floods have already occurred on the Yarkand and may be imminent on the Indus. Problems of predicting dangerous outbursts are outlined, uncertainties raised by limited and mainly older investigations. Implications of global climate change appear different for these hazards in this region than reports of dangerous glacial lakes elsewhere in the Himalaya.","glacial hazards; ice dams; Indus River; Karakoram Himalaya; outburst flood; Yarkand River","climate change; flood wave; glacial lake; glacier flow; global climate; ice-dammed lake; impoundment; outburst; China; Indus River; Karakoram; Xinjiang Uygur; Yarkant River",,,,,,"Fowler, H.A., Spatial and temporal variations in precipitation in the upper Indus River: Global teleconnections and hydrological implications (2004) Hydrology and Earth Science Systems, 8; Bajracharya, S.R., Mool, G.P., Glaciers, glacial lakes, and glacial lake outburst floods in the Mount Everest region, Nepal (2009) Annals of Glaciology, 50; The batura glacier in the karakoram mountains and its variations (1979) Scientia Sinica, 22. , Batura Investigations Group; Björnsson, H., Glacial lake outburst floods in mountain environments (2004) Mountain Geomorphology, , P.
