Among the many unresolved challenges is how to integrate information on future hydroclimatological conditions into the politically complex system of transboundary water agreements, including formal treaties, international agreements, and transnational management institutions. Yet, most treaties and international agreements lack important tools for dealing with current challenges, such as flood control and water quality, and they lack adequate mechanisms for addressing changing social, economic or climate conditions. There are various approaches that can be incorporated into existing treaties to allow for flexibility in the face of climate change, including: (1) adjustable allocation strategies and water-quality standards; (2) response strategies for extreme events; (3) amendment and review procedures; and (4) joint management institutions. We offer some explicit examples where specific strategies have been successfully implemented in ways that both reduce the risks of political conflicts over shared waters and lessen vulnerabilities to climatic changes. © 2011 IAHS Press.","Climate change; Extreme events; International agreements; Transboundary water resources; Water management; Water quality","Allocation strategy; Climate condition; Climatic changes; Extreme events; Fresh water resources; Global climate changes; System operation; Transboundary water; Transboundary water resources; Water quantities; Climate control; Contracts; Flood control; Information management; Water management; Water quality; Climate change; conflict management; extreme event; freshwater; global change; governance approach; implementation process; international agreement; vulnerability; water management; water quality; water resource",,,,,,"Bakker, M., Transboundary river floods and institutional capacity (2009) Journal of American Water Resources Association, 45 (3), pp. 553-566; Cooley, H., (2009) Understanding and reducing the risks of climate change for transboundary waters, , Report prepared for the United Nations Environment Programme; (2008) The effects of climate change on agriculture, land resources, water resources, and biodiversity in the United States, , CCSP (Climate Change Science Program), A report by the US Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research.
