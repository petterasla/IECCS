A long-term monitoring of snowmelt regimes in a Japanese alpine area revealed that the onset of the snowmelt season has been accelerated during the last 17 years in early snowmelt sites but that such a trend has not been detected in late snowmelt sites. This indicates that the global warming effect on the snowmelt pattern may be site-specific. The flowering phenology of fellfield plants in an exposed wind-blown habitat was consistent between an unusually warm year (1998) and a normal year (2001). In contrast, the flowering occurrence of snowbed plants varied greatly between the years depending on the snowmelt time. There was a large number of flowering species in the fellfield community from mid- to late to late June and from mid- to late July. The flowering peak of an early-melt snowbed plant community was in the middle of the flowering season and that of a late-melt snowbed community was in the early flowering season. These habitat-specific phenological patterns were consistent between 1998 and 2001. The effects of the variation in flowering timing on seed-set success were evaluated for an entomophilous snowbed herb, Peucedanum multivittatum, along the snowmelt gradient during a 5-year period. When flowering occurred prior to early August, mean temperature during the flowering season positively influenced the seed set. When flowering occurred later than early August, however, the plants enjoyed high seed-set success irrespective of temperature conditions if frost damage was absent. These observations are probably explained based on the availability of pollinators, which depends not only on ambient temperature but also on seasonal progress. These results suggest that the effects of climate change on biological interaction may vary depending on the specific habitat in the alpine ecosystem in which diverse snowmelt patterns create complicated seasonality for plants within a very localized area. © The Society of Population Ecology and Springer-Verlag 2005.","Alpine plants; Flowering phenology; Global warming; Seed production; Snowmelt time","alpine environment; climate change; flowering; global change; phenology; seed set; snowmelt; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Peucedanum; Peucedanum multivittatum",,,,,,"Bergman, P., Molau, U., Holmgren, B., Micrometeorological impacts on insect activity and plant reproductive success in an alpine environment, Swedish Lapland (1996) Arct Antarct Alp Res, 28, pp. 196-202; Billings, W.D., Adaptations and origins of alpine plants (1974) Arct Antarct Alp Res, 6, pp. 129-142; Billings, W.D., Bliss, L.C., An alpine snowbank environment and its effect on vegetation, plant development, and productivity (1959) Ecology, 40, pp. 388-397; (1994) Climate Change and Snow Cover Duration in the Victorian Alps, , Report to the Environmental Protection Authority.
