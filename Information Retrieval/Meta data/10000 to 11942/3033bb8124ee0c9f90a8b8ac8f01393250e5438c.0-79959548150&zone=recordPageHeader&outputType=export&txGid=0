The event objectives included: (a) to discuss the integration of information systems from different geosciences disciplines; (b) to promote and discuss the present process to scale from specific and monolithic systems towards independent and modular enabling infrastructures - forming an earth system science (ESS) infrastructure; and (c) to show some of the latest advances in implementing open standards. This manuscript introduces the event motivations and describes the abstract and holistic framework, which can be used to situate the topics and the developments presented by the event speakers. This manuscript introduces important, and relatively new technologies to build a multi-disciplinary geosciences information system: the System of Systems approach and the Model Driven Approach. To achieve that, three important information infrastructure categories are recognised: (a) ESS information infrastructure; (b) geospatial information infrastructure; and (c) distributed information infrastructure. Digital Earth should support the discussed framework to accelerate information transfer from theoretical discussions to applications, in all fields related to global climate change, natural disaster prevention and response, new energy-source development, agricultural and food security, and urban planning and management. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Digital earth infrastructures; Information modelling approach; Interoperability standards; Multi-disciplinary interoperability; System of Systems",,,,,,,"Adams, K., Keating, C.B., Padilla, J.J., System of Systems Engineering requirements: Challenges and guidelines (2008) Engineering Management Journal, , http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi-qa5394/is-200812/ai-n31428982/?tag-content;col1, Available from, [Accessed 13 March 2010]; Baker, D.N., Informatics and the 2007-2008 electronic geophysical year, EOS transactions (2008) American Geophysical Union, 89 (48), pp. 485-500; Butterfield, M.L., Pearlman, J., Vickroy, S.C., (2008) A System-of-Systems Engineering GEOSS Architectural Approach, , IEEE GEOSS Paper; Chesbrough, H., Spohrer, J., A research manifesto for services science (2006) Communications of the ACM, 49 (7), pp. 35-40; Dilauro, T., Choosing the components of a digital infrastructure (2004) First Monday, 9 (5). , http://131.193.153.231/www/issues/issue9-5/dilauro/index.html, Available from, [Accessed 18 March 2010]; Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Interoperability for Pan-European eGovernment Services (2006) COM, (2006), p. 45. , European Commission, final, Brussels; Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Scaling system-level science: Scientific exploration and IT implications (2006) IEEE Computer, 39 (11), pp. 31-39; Gorton, I., Data-intensive computing in the 21st century (2008) IEEE Computer, 41 (4), pp. 30-32; (2005) The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) 10-year implementation plan, , Group on Earth Observations, In: B.
