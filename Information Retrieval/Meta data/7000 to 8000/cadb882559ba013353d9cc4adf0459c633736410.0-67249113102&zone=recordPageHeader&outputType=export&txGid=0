The environmental chamber applies water and air input to control inundation and evaporation conditions at the soil surface. Example results show that a well-compacted intermediate-plasticity model embankment performs well when subjected to 19 years of alternating wet and dry periods. Finally, the paper reports an experimental methodology that will allow further model tests to be conducted to examine how different climate scenarios, soil types and compaction levels may affect long-term embankment response. © 2009 Thomas Telford Ltd.","Embankments; Environment; Failures","Centrifuge modelling; Climate scenarios; Climatic effects; Environment; Experimental methodology; Failures; Geotechnical centrifuges; Global climate changes; Model tests; Plasticity model; Soil surfaces; Soil types; Wet and dry; Canals; Centrifugation; Centrifuges; Clay minerals; Climate change; Drought; Environmental chambers; Geologic models; Hydraulic structures; Soils; Climate models; Embankments; Embankments; Climate change",,,,,,"O'Brien, A.S., Rehabilitation of urban railway embankments: Research, analysis and stabilization (2007) Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, 1, pp. 125-143. , Madrid; Scott, J., Loveridge, F., O'Brien, A.S., Influence of climate and vegetation on railway embankments (2007) Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, 2, pp. 659-664. , Madrid; Take, A., Bolton, M.D., Identification of seasonal slope behaviour mechanisms from centrifuge case studies (2004) Advances in Geotechnical Engineering: Proceedings of the Skempton Conference, 2, pp. 992-1004; Smethurst, J.A., Clarke, D., Powrie, W., Seasonal changes in pore water pressure in a grass covered cut slope in London clay (2006) Proceedings ofthe Institution ofCivil Engineers, Geotechnique, 56 (8), pp. 523-537; Kovacevic, K., Potts, D.M., Vaughan, P.R., Progressive failure in clay embankments due to seasonal climate changes (2001) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference in Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, 3, pp. 2127-2130. , Istanbul; Schofield A.
