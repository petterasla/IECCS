Two types of soils differing in vegetation and moisture status were collected and incubated under two temperatures (10 and 30 °C) and two soil moisture regimes (35 and 75% of water holding capacity, WHC) for 5 weeks. Before and after the incubation experiment, the temperature coefficient of soil respiration was measured using soda-lime method by changing temperature in a water bath. For both soils, the mean Q10 values of the respiration rate were 2.0 in the 30 °C and 2.3 in the 10 °C soil treatments. Higher temperature with lower soil moisture treatment significantly decreased the Q10 value, whereas lower temperature with higher soil moisture treatment significantly enhanced the Q10 value (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that soils became less sensitive to temperature when incubated under higher temperature with higher moisture conditions, and more sensitive in lower temperature with higher moisture conditions. There was a significant correlation (r2 = 0.67, p &lt; 0.05) between water-soluble carbon (WSC) and soil respiration rate. However, the correlation between soil respiration rate and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was weak (r2 = 0.27, p &gt; 0.05). Although incubation temperature and moisture accounted for 40 and 29% (as r2 × 100%), respectively, of variations in Q10, soil water-soluble carbon content alone could have explained 79% of the variation, indicating that the availability of respiratory substrate, rather than the pool of soil microorganisms, played a crucial role in the response of the temperature coefficient to environmental factors. These results suggest that biotic factors should also be taken into consideration when using the Q10 function to predict the response of soil respiration to global warming. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
