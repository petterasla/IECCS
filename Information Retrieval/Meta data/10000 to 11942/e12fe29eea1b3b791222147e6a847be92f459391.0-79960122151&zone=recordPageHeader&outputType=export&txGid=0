In this paper, threebest track datasetsforthe western North Pacific TCs were comparedina seasonal context. Firstly,the statistical characteristics were examined based on their distributions. Then, the potential impact of particular features within the datasets was evaluated by using contrastive cluster analyses. The mean amplitude of the annual cycle in the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) data is largest among the three datasets. The smallest interannualvariability helpedthe ShanghaiTyphoon Instituteof China Meteorological Administration (CMA-STI) dataset to resist the negative effect of outliers. An inhomogeneity around 2003-2004 was identified in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) databy the outliers andwas compared with the JMA and CMA-STI data. By using contrastive cluster analyses, the differences among the datasets and some effects related to particular issues, including the representation of the annual cycle, the outliers, and wind conversion were evaluated. The JTWC dataset is affected by outliers and wind conversion among the different average times,whereas the representation of the annual cycle was important for the CMA-STI data. After excluding all the outliers, the results indicated more consistent classifications of the TC annual cycle between the JMA and JTWC data. © 2011, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"annual cycle; annual variation; cluster analysis; data set; geostatistics; global warming; inhomogeneity; storm track; tropical cyclone; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",,,,,,"Atkinson, G.D., Holliday, C.R., Tropicalcyclone minimum sea level pressure/maximum sustained wind relationship for the western NorthPacific (1977) Mon.Wea.
