Strategies to reduce emissions can consist of a fuel switch, engine changes, or end-ofpipe technologies, but they do not necessarily imply reduced life cycle emissions. The present paper assesses the environmental performance of marine fuels from well-to-propeller using life cycle assessment (LCA). Four fossil fuels are compared: heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil, gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), combined with two exhaust abatement techniques: open-loop scrubber and selective catalytic reduction. LNG and other alternatives that comply with the SECA 2015 and Tier III NOx requirements give decreased acidification and eutrophication potentials with 78-90 per cent in a life cycle perspective compared with HFO. In contrast, the use of LNG does not decrease the global warming potential by more than 8-20 per cent, the amount depending mainly on the magnitude of the methane slip from the gas engine. None of the fossil fuels scrutinized here would decrease the greenhouse gas emissions significantly from a life cycle perspective. The study supports the need for LCA when evaluating the environmental impact of a fuel change, e.g. it is found that the highest global warming potential during the whole life cycle is connected to the alternatives with GTL fuel.","Gas-to-liquid fuel; Heavy fuel oil; Life cycle assessment; Liquefied natural gas; Marine fuels; Marine gas oil","Gas-to-liquid fuel; Heavy Fuel-Oil; Life cycle assessment; Marine fuels; Marine gas oil; Comparative life cycle assessment; Environmental performance; Eutrophication potentials; Gas to liquids; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Marine fuels; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Fossil fuels; Fuel oils; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Gas fuel purification; Gas oils; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Liquefied natural gas; Liquids; Marine engines; Methane; Rating; Selective catalytic reduction; Engines; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Fossil fuels; Fuel oils; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel purification; Gas oils; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Liquefied natural gas; Marine engines; Natural gas; Residual fuels; Selective catalytic reduction; Ships; Life cycle; Life cycle",,,,,,"Corbett, J.J., Fischbeck, P., Emissions from ships (1997) Science, 278 (5339), pp. 823-824. , DOI 10.1126/science.278.5339.823; Eyring, V., Köhler, H.W., Lauer, A., Lemper, B., Emissions from international shipping: 2.
