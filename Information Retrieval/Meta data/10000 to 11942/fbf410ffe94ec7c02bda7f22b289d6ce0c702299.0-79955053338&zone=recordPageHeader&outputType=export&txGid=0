We analyzed the impacts of the two radiation schemes on heating rates. Then we studied their instantaneous radiative efficiency, stratospheric adjusted radiative efficiency, global warming potential (GWP), and global temperature potential (GTP), for both clear- and all-sky conditions using a high-resolution radiation scheme. We found that the stratosphere-adjusted radiative efficiencies of C2F6, CF4, and SF6 for the whole sky were 0.346, 0.098, and 0.680 W m-2 ppbv-1, respectively. Radiative forcing from the industrial revolution to 2005 was 0.001, 0.007, and 0.004 W m-2, respectively; and was predicted to rise to 0.008, 0.036, and 0.037 W m-2, respectively, by 2100, according to emission scenarios provided by the IPCC. The GWPs of C2F6, CF4, and SF6 are 17035, 7597, and 31298, respectively, for a time horizon of 100 years relative to CO2. Their GTPs of pulse and sustained emissions, GTPP and GTPS, are 22468, 10052, and 40935 and 16498, 7355, and 30341, respectively, for a 100-year time horizon. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","correlated k-distribution; global temperature potential (GTP); global warming potential (GWP); PFCs; radiative forcing; SF6","Global temperatures; global warming potential (GWP); K-Distribution; PFCs; Radiative forcings; SF<sub>6</sub>; Efficiency; Global warming; Sulfur; Sulfur hexafluoride; air temperature; emission; fluorocarbon; global warming; heating; radiative forcing; sulfur compound",,,,,,"Solomon, S., Qin, D., Manning, M., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
