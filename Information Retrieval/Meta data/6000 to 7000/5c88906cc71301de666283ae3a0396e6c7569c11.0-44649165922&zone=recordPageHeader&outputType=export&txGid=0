After its annual low in winter, T. longicornis abundance begins to increase in coastal waters with the northern progression of spring conditions. Annual maximum shelf concentrations were found in the more southern inshore waters of the region during the summer months. Abundance throughout most of the ecosystem increased sharply in the early 1990s and remained high through 2001. During this period, the copepod became more numerous and widespread in offshore shelf waters. Abundance declined to approximately average levels in 2002 for the remainder of the time series, but its extended offshore range remained intact. Correlation analysis found that the copepods interannual abundance variability had a significant negative relationship with surface salinity anomalies throughout the ecosystem, with higher correlations found in the northernmost subareas. Temora longicornis abundance in the ecosystem's southernmost subarea (Middle Atlantic Bight) did not increase in the 1990s and was found to be negatively correlated to surface temperature, indicating that continued global warming could adversely impact the copepods annual abundance cycle in this region. © The Author 2008.
