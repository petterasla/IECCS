He illustrates these properties with theoretical examples and applies his results to global warming data and failure data for emergency diesel generators.","Change-point model; Existence; Exponential family; Generalized linear model; Identifiability; Maximum likelihood; Uniqueness",,,,,,,"Barndorff-Nielsen, O., (1978) Information and Exponential Families in Statistical Theory, , Wiley, New York; Baron, M., Granott, N., Consistent estimation of early and frequent change points (2003) Foundations of Statistical Inference: Proceedings of the Shoresh Conference 2000, pp. 181-193. , (Y.
