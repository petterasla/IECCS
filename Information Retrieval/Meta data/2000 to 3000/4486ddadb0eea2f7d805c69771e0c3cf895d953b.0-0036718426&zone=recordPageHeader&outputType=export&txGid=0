Water resources are a main component of natural systems that might be affected by climate change. This paper characterizes water resources in several Middle Eastern countries and evaluates regional climate predictions for various scenarios using general circulation models. The country of Lebanon is selected as a case study for an in-depth investigation with potential impacts on the water budget and soil moisture as indicators. Adaptation measures are assessed, with a focus on no-regret actions in the context of local socioeconomic and environmental frameworks.","Climate changes; Lebanon; Middle east; Water balance; Water circulation; Water resources","Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Global warming; Weather forecasting; Circulation models; Water resources; climate change; global warming; water resource; Lebanon; Middle East",,,,,,"Alatout, S., Water balances in Palestine: Numbers and political culture in the Middle East (2000) Water Balances in the Eastern Mediterranean, pp. 59-84. , D.
