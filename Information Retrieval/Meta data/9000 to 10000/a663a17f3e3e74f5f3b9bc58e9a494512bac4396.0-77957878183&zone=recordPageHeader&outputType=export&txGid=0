Recent evidence of sea level rise coupled with potential future global warming indicate that sea level rise will accelerate and hurricanes may intensify over the coming decades. In regions fronted by barrier islands, the protective capacity of these islands may diminish as they are degraded by rising sea level. Here we present a hydrodynamic and geospatial analysis of the relative role of barrier island degradation on potential future hurricane flooding. For the City of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA, hurricane flooding is projected to rise between 20% and 70% by the 2030s, resulting in an increase in property damages and impacted population. These findings indicate that adaptive management strategies should be developed and adopted for mitigating loss of natural barrier islands when these islands act as protective features for populated bayside communities. Finally, this study illustrates a method for applying models to forecast future storm protection benefits of barrier island restoration projects. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Adaptive Management; Barrier islands; Coastal communities; Corpus christi; Geospatial analysis; Property damage; Protective capacity; Restoration project; Sea level rise; Storm protection; Texas , USA; Degradation; Global warming; Sea level; Hurricanes; adaptive management; barrier island; coastal zone; community structure; environmental degradation; flooding; global warming; hurricane; hydrodynamics; numerical model; restoration ecology; sea level change; spatial analysis; Corpus Christi; Texas; United States",,,,,,"Travis, J., (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1656-1659; Irish, J.L., Resio, D.T., Ratcliff, J.J., (2008) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 38 (9), pp. 2003-2013; (2008) Hurricane Ike storm surge FEMA high water marks, , Federal Emergency Management Agency; Intergovernmental panel on climate change fourth assessment report working group 1 report: the physical science basis, , http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Elsner, J.B., Kossin, J.P., Jagger, T.H., (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 92-95; Chronological list of all hurricane which affected the continental United States: 1851-2007, , http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/ushurrlist18512007.txt, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Nakićenovic, N., Alcamo, J., Davis, G., deVries, B., Fenhann, J., Gaffin, S., (2000) Emissions scenarios: a special report of the working group III of the international panel on climate change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York; Historical hurricane tracks, , http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/index.jsp, National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration; White, N.J., Church, J.A., Gregory, J.M., (2005) Geophysical Research Letters, 32, pp. L01601; Miller, L., Douglas, B.C., (2004) Nature, 428, pp. 406-409; Church, J.A., White, N.J., (2006) Geophysical Research Letters, 33, pp. L01602; Pfeffer, W.T., Harper, J.T., O'Neel, S., (2008) Science, 321, pp. 1340-1343; Rahmstorf, S., (2007) Science, 315, pp. 368-370; Otto-Bliesner, B.L., Marshall, S.J., Overpeck, J.T., Miller, G.H., Hu, A., (2006) Science, 311, pp. 1751-1753; Simpson, R.H., (1974) Weatherwise, 27, pp. 169-186; Knutson, T.R., Tuleya, R.E., (2008) Climate extremes and society, pp. 120-144. , Columbia University Press, New York, H.
