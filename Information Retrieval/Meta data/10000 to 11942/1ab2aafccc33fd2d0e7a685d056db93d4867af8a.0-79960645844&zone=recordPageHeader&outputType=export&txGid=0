In this work the voltage responses of ceramic based piezoelectric fibre composite structures (PFCs) and polymer based piezoelectric strips, PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride), were evaluated when subjected to various wind speeds and water droplets in order to investigate the possibility of energy generation from these two natural renewable energy sources for utilization in low power electronic devices. The effects of material dimensions, drop mass, releasing height of the drops and wind speed on the voltage output were studied and the power was calculated. This work showed that piezoelectric polymer materials can generate higher voltage/power than ceramic based piezoelectric materials and it was proved that producing energy from renewable sources such as rain drops and wind is possible by using piezoelectric polymer materials. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Effects of materials; Energy generations; Low Power; Piezoelectric fibre composites; Piezoelectric polymer materials; Piezoelectric strips; Polymer based; Polyvinylidene fluorides; PZT; Rain drops; Renewable energy source; Renewable sources; Research and development; Voltage output; Voltage response; Water droplets; Wind speed; Ceramic materials; Composite structures; Crystallography; Drops; Electric power systems; Energy harvesting; Global warming; MEMS; Piezoelectric devices; Piezoelectric materials; Piezoelectricity; Polymers; Structure (composition); Renewable energy resources",,,,,,"Umeda, M., Nakamura, K., Ueha, S., (1997) Japan.
