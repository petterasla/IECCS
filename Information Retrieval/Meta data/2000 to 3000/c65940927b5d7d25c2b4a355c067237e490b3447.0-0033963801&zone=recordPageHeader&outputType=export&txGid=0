In the past, land management has generally resulted in considerable depletion of soil organic matter and the release into the atmosphere of such radiatively active gases as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Global climate change, to the extent that it occurs, will strongly impact all soil processes. At this time, the task of soil management should be to restore soil organic carbon in order to enhance soil structure and fertility and to help counter the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Widely varying estimates of the soil's organic carbon content and of the potential for soil carbon sequestration point to the need to conduct a comprehensive inventory of this important property.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Soil organic matter; Soil-climate interactions","carbon cycle; climate change; soil management",,,,,,"Aveyard, J.M., (1988) Climatic Changes - Implications for Land Degradation in New South Wales, , Department of Conservation and Land Management, New South Wales, Chatswood, NSW; Bouwman, A.F., (1990) Soils and the Greenhouse Effect, , Wiley, Chichester, UK; Buol, S.W., Sanchez, P.A., Weed, S.B., Kimble, J.M., Predicted impact of climatic warming on soil properties and use (1990) Impact of Carbon Dioxide, Trace Gases, and Climate Change on Global Agriculture, pp. 711-782. , B.A. Kimball, N.J.
