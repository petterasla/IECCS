Historical changes shown by these plankton remains indicated that the Daphnia population has not produced resting eggs since the 1980s, but it has remained the most abundant zooplankton species in the lake. Plankton monitoring data collected from 1966 to 2000 revealed that the overwintering individuals (January-March) of D. galeata plankters showed a significant increasing trend in recent years, such increase being negatively correlated with ephippial abundance in the sediment samples. Further analyses showed that the dominant phytoplankton in winter has changed from large inedible diatoms to edible flagellated algae, probably due to changes in vertical mixing regimes resulting from winter warming. These changes that occurred in the last several decades suggest that global warming has improved winter food conditions and thus enabled the Daphnia plankton to maintain its population without producing resting eggs in Lake Biwa. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","20th century; Daphnia; Lake Biwa; Resting eggs; Winter warming; Zooplankton","abundance; egg production; flagellate; global warming; historical record; long-term change; overwintering; paleobotany; sampling; seasonal variation; twentieth century; zooplankton; Asia; Biwa Lake; Eurasia; Far East; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Shiga; algae; Bacillariophyta; Daphnia; Daphnia galeata",,,,,,"Ahlgren, G., Lundstedt, L., Brett, M., Forsberg, C.J., Lipid composition and food quality of some freshwater phytoplankton for cladoceran zooplankters (1990) J Plankton Res, 12, pp. 809-818; Alekseev, V., Lampert, W., Maternal control of resting-egg production in Daphnia (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 899-901; Anneville, O., Soussi, S., Gammeter, S., Straile, D., Seasonal and inter-annual scales of variability in phytoplankton assemblages: Comparison of phytoplankton dynamics in 3 pre-alpine lakes over a period of 28 years (2004) Freshw Biol, 49, pp. 98-115; Battarbee, R.W., Diatom analysis (1986) Handbook of Holocene Palaeoecology and Palaeohydrology, pp. 527-570. , B.
