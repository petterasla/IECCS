The results showed that the warming in summer was 0.15°C/10a in Northeast China, which was higher than that on the global, Northern Hemisphere or Northeast Asia scale in the recent 50 years. The responses of NET to global warming were shown in 3 aspects mainly. Firstly, it became warm and the average temperature increased in summer; secondly, the temperature variability increased, which displayed the increase of climatic instability; thirdly, the disaster of low temperature decreased and high temperature damage increased obviously, but the disaster of low temperature still existed in some areas under global warming background, which would be worthy of notice further.","Climate features; Disaster of low temperature; Global warming; Northeast China; Summer temperature","global warming; regional climate; summer; temperature; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,,,,,"Ding, S.-S., Analysis of low temperature and its impacts on agriculture in summer in Northeast China (1980) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 38 (3), pp. 234-241. , (in Chinese); Ju, X.-S., Yang, X.-W., Chen, L.-J., Research on determination of station indexes and division of regional flood/drought grades in China (1997) Quarterly Journal of Applied Meteorology, 8 (1), pp. 26-32. , (in Chinese); Si, N., Chen, J.-Q., Tu, Q.-P., 4-phase climate change features in the last 100 years over China (1995) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 53 (4), pp. 531-539. , (in Chinese); Wang, J.-F., Wu, G.-X., Evolution and characteristics of the persistent cold summer in Northeast China (1997) Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, 21 (5), pp. 523-532. , (in Chinese); Wei, F.-Y., Cao, H.-X., Detection of abrupt changes and trend prediction of the air temperature in China, the North Hemisphere, and the globe (1995) Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, 19 (2), pp. 140-148. , (in Chinese); Wu, S.-A., Jiang, Z.-H., Tu, Q.-P., Summer and winter temperature variability and their impacts on regional warming stability in China in recent 44 years (2002) Journal of Nanjing Institute of Meteorology, 25 (6), pp. 830-836. , (in Chinese); Yang, S.-Y., Wang, Q.-Q., Spatial/temporal variations of summer temperature in Northeast China in recent 50years (2003) Journal of Nanjing Institute of Meteorology, 26 (5), pp. 653-660. , (in Chinese); Yao, P.-Z., The climate features of summer low temperature cold damage in Northeast China during recent 40 years (1995) Journal of Catastrophology, 10 (1), pp. 51-56. , (in Chinese); Zheng, W.-Z., Ni, Y.-Q., Diagnostic study on impact of sea surface temperature anomalies over tropical and mid-latitude pacific on summer low temperature cool damage in Northeast China (1999) Journal of Applied Meteorology, 10 (4), pp. 394-401. , (in Chinese)","Gong, Q.; Institute of Meteorological Energy Exploitation and Application, Shenyang 110016, China; email: isgq@sina.com",,,,,,,,10020063,,,,"English","Chin.
