In this paper, data from three sites representing well-drained soils in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests are used to illustrate the methods for using radiocarbon to determine the turnover times of soil organic matter and to partition soil respiration. For these sites, the average age of bulk carbon in detrital and Oh/A-horizon organic carbon ranges from 200 to 1200 yr. In each case, this mass-weighted average includes components such as relatively undecomposed leaf, root, and moss litter with much shorter turnover times, and humified or mineral-associated organic matter with much longer turnover times. The average age of carbon in organic matter is greater than the average age predicted for CO2 produced by its decomposition (30, 8, and 3 yr for boreal, temperate, and tropical soil), or measured in total soil respiration (16, 3, and 1 yr). Most of the CO2 produced during decomposition is derived from relatively short-lived soil organic matter (SOM) components that do not represent a large component of the standing stock of soil organic matter. Estimates of soil carbon turnover obtained by dividing C stocks by heterotrophic respiration fluxes, or from radiocarbon measurements of bulk SOM, are biased to longer time scales of C cycling. Failure to account for the heterogeneity of soil organic matter will result in underestimation of the short-term response and overestimation of the long-term response of soil C storage to future changes in inputs or decomposition. Comparison of the 14C in soil respiration with soil organic matter in temperate and boreal forest sites indicates a significant contribution from decomposition of organic matter fixed &gt;2 yr but &lt;30 yr ago. Tropical soil respiration is dominated by C fixed &lt;1 yr ago. Monitoring the 14C signature of CO2 emitted from soils give clues as to the causes of seasonal and interannual variability in soil respiration in these systems.","Belowground processes and global change; Carbon cycle; Global climate change; Radiocarbon; Sink; Soil organic matter; Soil respiration; Source","global change; organic matter; soil carbon; soil respiration",,,,,,"Allen, A.S., Andrews, J.A., Finzi, A.C., Matamala, R., Richter, D.D., Schlesinger, W.H., Effects of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) on belowground processes in a Pinus taeda forest (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 437-448; Bolin, B., The Kyoto negotiations on climate change: A science perspective (1998) Science, 279, pp. 330-331; Broecker, W.S., Peng, T.-H., (1982) Tracers in the Sea, , Eldigio Press, New York, New York, USA; Burcholadze, A.A., Chudy, M., Eristavi, I.V., Pagava, S.V., Povinec, P., Sivo, A., Togonidze, G.I., Anthropogenic 14C variations in atmospheric CO2 and wines (1989) Radiocarbon, 31, pp. 771-776; Camargo, P., Trumbore, S.E., Martinelli, L.A., Davidson, E.A., Nepstad, D.C., Victoria, R., Carbon dynamics in regrowing forest of eastern Amazonia (1999) Global Change Biology, 5, pp. 693-702; Campbell, C.A., Paul, E.A., Rennie, D.A., McCallum, K.J., Applicability of the carbon-dating method of analysis to soil humus studies (1967) Soil Science, 104, pp. 217-224; Davidson, E.A., Belk, E., Boone, R.D., Soil water content and temperature as independent or confounded factors controlling soil respiration in a temperate mixed hardwood forest (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 217-227; Dörr, H., Munnich, K.O., Annual variations of the 14C content of soil CO2 (1986) Radiocarbon, 28, pp. 338-345; Ehleringer, J.R., Buchmann, N., Flanagan, L.B., Carbon isotope ratios in belowground carbon cycle processes (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 412-422; Fung, I., Field, C.B., Berry, J.A., Thompson, M.V., Randerson, J.T., Malmstrorn, C.M., Vitousek, P.M., John, J., Carbon 13 exchanges between the atmosphere and biosphere (1997) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 4, pp. 507-533; Gaudinski, J., Trumbore, S.E., Davidson, E.A., Belk, E., Partitioning soil respiration using a radiocarbon mass balance approach Biogeochemistry, , in press; Goulden, M.L., Munger, J.W., Fan, S.-M., Daube, B.C., Wofsy, S.C., Exchange of carbon dioxide by a deciduous forest: Response to interannual climate variability (1996) Science, 271, pp. 1576-1578; Goulden, M.L., Wofsy, S.C., Harden, J.W., Trumbore, S.E., Crill, P.M., Gower, S.T., Fries, T., Munger, J.W., Sensitivity of boreal forest carbon balance to soil thaw (1998) Science, 279, pp. 214-217; Harden, J.W., O'Neill, K.P., Trumbore, S.E., Veldhuis, H., Stocks, B.J., Moss and soil contributions to the annual net carbon flux in a maturing boreal forest (1997) Journal of Geophysical Research, 102, pp. 28817-28830; Harkness, D.D., Harrison, A.F., Bacon, P.J., The temporal distribution of 'bomb' 14C in a forest soil (1986) Radiocarbon, 28, pp. 328-337; Harrison, K., Broecker, W., Bonani, G., A strategy for estimating the impact of CO2 fertilization on soil carbon storage (1993) Global Biogeochemichal Cycles, 7, pp. 69-80; Hseih, Y.-P., Radiocarbon signatures of turnover rates in active soil organic carbon pools (1993) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 57, pp. 1020-1022; Jackson, R.B., Schenk, H.J., Jobbágy, E.G., Canadell, J., Colello, G.D., Dickinson, R.E., Field, C.B., Sykes, M.T., Belowground consequences of vegetation change and their treatment in models (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 470-483; Jenkinson, D.S., Harkness, D.D., Vance, E.D., Adam, D.E., Calculating net primary production and annual input of organic matter to soil from the amount and radiogenic content of soil organic matter (1992) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 24, pp. 295-305; Jobbágy, E.G., Jackson, R.B., The vertical distribution of soil organic carbon and its relation to climate and vegetation (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 423-436; Levin, I., Bösinger, R., Bonani, G., Francey, R.J., Kromer, B., Munnich, K.O., Suter, M., Wölfli, W., Radiocarbon in atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane: Global distribution and trends (1992) Radiocarbon after Four Decades, pp. 503-518. , E.
