Southern Africa was delineated into 712 relatively homogeneous climate zones, each with specific climate, soil and vegetation response information. The primary productivity and crop yield models were linked with the climate zones via a cellbased agrohydrologlcal model, with the final output coordinated using a Geographic Information System. The results of this preliminary study show a large dependence of production and crop yield on the intra-seasonal and inter-annual variation of rainfall. The most Important conclusion from the study is the readiness of the developed tool and associated infrastructure for future analysis into social, technological and political responses to food security in southern Africa. © 1993.",,"agricultural productivity;
