Furthermore, increased ground level temperatures as a consequence of global warming may favour development of pathogens, such as Cercospora beticola, that thrive at high temperatures. This study evaluates the effect of combined UV stress and Cercospora leaf-spot disease on young sugarbeet plants (Beta vulgaris L.). An inoculum consisting of twelve European isolates of C. beticola Sacc. was used in the experiments. One Cercospora-sensitive and one Cercospora-tolerant sugarbeet line were analysed from growth regimes where plants were grown either under visible radiation alone or with supplemental UV-B. Photosynthetic pigments and partial reactions of photosynthesis, including potential yield and quantum yield under illumination, non-photochemical quenching (q(NPQ)) and photochemical quenching (q(p)), were measured to assess plant response. The combination of Cercospora and supplemental UV-B radiation in the sensitive line resulted in a decreased photosynthetic efficiency, shown by q(NPQ) and quantum yield under illumination as compared with that for either stress applied alone. The F(v)/F(m) was unchanged for plants subjected to UV-B radiation without infection, although the q(NPQ) decreased. The Cercospora-tolerant line showed no significant differences under the different treatments. Thus, the line tolerant to Cercospora infection also proved to be tolerant to UV-B radiation alone and in combination with the infection.",,"cercospora leaf spot; differential display; Europe; fungal infection; inoculation; photochemical quenching; photosynthesis; plant growth; ultraviolet irradiation; Beta vulgaris; Cercospora beticola",,,,,,"Björn, L.O., Effects of ozone depletion and increased UV-B on terrestrial ecosystems (1996) Int J Environ Stud, 51, pp. 217-243; Björn, L.O., Murphy, T.M., Computer calculation of solar ultraviolet radiation at ground level (1985) Physiol Vég, 23, pp. 555-561; Bornman, J.F., Sundby-Emanuelsson, C., Response of plants to UV-B radiation: Some biochemical and physiological effects (1995) Environment and Plant Metabolism: Flexibility and Acclimation.
