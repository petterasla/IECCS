Comparison of our data with previous results from the same region reveals an increase in potential temperature and decreases in salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom layer (deeper than 3000 m) over the past four decades. The changes were significantly different from the analytical precisions. Detailed investigation of the temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and σ3 value distributions and the bottom water flow in the north Ross Sea suggests a long-term change in water mass mixing balance. That is to say, it is speculated that the influence of cool, saline, high-oxygen bottom water (high-salinity Ross Sea Bottom Water) formed in the southwestern Ross Sea has possibly been decreased, while the influences of relatively warmer and fresher bottom water (low-salinity Ross Sea Bottom Water) and the Adélie Land Bottom Water coming from the Australia-Antarctic Basin have increased. The possible impact of global warming on ocean circulation needs much more investigation. © pringer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Bottom water circulation; Dissolved oxygen; Long-term change; Potential temperature; Ross Sea; Salinity","bottom water; concentration (composition); dissolved oxygen; global warming; mixing ratio; oceanic circulation; salinity; sea surface temperature; warming; water mass; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean",,,,,,"Aoki, S., Rintoul, S.R., Ushio, S., Watanabe, S., Bindoff, N.L., Freshening of the Adélie Land Bottom Water near 140°E (2005) Geophys.
