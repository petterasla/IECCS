This region contains many locations that are vulnerable to extreme sea levels in the current climate, and projections indicate that this vulnerability will increase in the future. The recent publication of authoritative statements on the relationship between global warming and global sea level rise, tropical cyclones and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon has motivated this review. Confident predictions of global mean sea level rise are modified by regional differences in the steric (density-related) component of sea level rise and changing gravitational interactions between the ocean and the ice sheets which affect the regional distribution of the eustatic (mass-related) contribution to sea level rise. The most extreme sea levels in this region are generated by tropical cyclones. The intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones is likely to increase, but many climate models project a substantial decrease in tropical cyclone numbers in this region, which may lead to an overall decrease in the total number of intense tropical cyclones. This projection, however, needs to be better quantified using improved high-resolution climate model simulations of tropical cyclones. Future changes in ENSO may lead to large regional variations in tropical cyclone incidence and sea level rise, but these impacts are also not well constrained. While storm surges from tropical cyclones give the largest sea level extremes in the parts of this region where they occur, other more frequent high sea level events can arise from swell generated by distant storms. Changes in wave climate are projected for the tropical Pacific due to anthropogenically-forced changes in atmospheric circulation. Future changes in sea level extremes will be caused by a combination of changes in mean sea level, regional sea level trends, tropical cyclone incidence and wave climate. Recommendations are given for research to increase understanding of the response of these factors to climate change. Implications of the results for adaptation research are also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; ENSO; Sea level; South Pacific; Tropical cyclones","Atmospheric circulation; Climate change impact; Climate model simulations; ENSO; Global mean sea levels; Global sea level rise; Gravitational interaction; High resolution; Ice sheet; Mean sea level; Oscillation phenomenon; Regional distribution; Regional variation; Sea level rise; Sea level trends; South Pacific; Storm surges; Tropical cyclone; Wave climates; Atmospheric pressure; Climate change; Climatology; Computer simulation; Global warming; Gravitation; Hurricanes; Nickel compounds; Ocean currents; Sea level; Storms; Tropics; Climate models; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; prediction; sea level change; storm; tropical cyclone; vulnerability; wave climate; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South)",,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Agrawala, S., Mirza, M.M.Q., Conde, C., O'Brien, K., Pulhin, J., Pulwarty, R., Takahashi, K., Assessment of adaptation practices, options, constraints and capacity (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
