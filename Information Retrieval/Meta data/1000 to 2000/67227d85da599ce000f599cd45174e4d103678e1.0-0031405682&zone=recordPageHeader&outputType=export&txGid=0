The methodology allows consistent comparisons of the costs and quantifies of carbon stored in different types of projects and/or national programs, facilitating the inclusion of forestry and biomass energy projects in a possible CO2 emission reduction regime. The framework presented includes guidelines for defining a reference case against which carbon-storage projects are compared, a carbon- storage accounting method based on simple analytic techniques for one-time terrestrial sinks, an endowment approach to incremental costing, and a discussion of local benefits and risk factors.","Biomass energy; Carbon stock models; Carbon storage costs; Forest conservation; Global climate change; Reforestation; Terrestrial carbon sinks","bioenergy; biomass power; carbon storage; economic analysis; emissions control; environmental economics; forestry; forestry production; land use; methodology; project cost; bioenergy; biomass; cost benefit analysis; ecosystem; forestry; global climate; methodology; review; risk factor",,,,,,"Ahuja, D., (1994) The Incremental Cost of Climate Change Mitigation Projects, , Global Environmental Facility Working Paper, Washington; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., The Storage and Production of Organic Matter in Tropical Forests and their Role in the Global Carbon Cycle (1982) Biotropica, 14, pp. 161-178; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., Chapman, J., Biomass of Tropical Tree Plantations and its Limitations for the Global Carbon Budget (1986) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 16, pp. 390-394; Brown, S., Gillespie, A.J.R., Lugo, A.E., Biomass Estimations for Tropical Forests with Applications to Forest Inventory Data (1989) Forest Science, 35 (4), pp. 881-902; Cooper, C.F., Carbon Storage in Managed Forests (1983) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 13, pp. 155-166; (1993) Programa de Desarrollo Forestal del Oriente de Venezuela, , CVG, Caracas; Durst, P.B., Financial Aspects of Contract Reforestation in the Philippines (1987) FPEI Working Paper No. 10, , Southeastern Center for Forest Economics Research, Raleigh, NC; Fearnside, P.M., (1992) Carbon Emissions and Sequestration in Forests: BrazilLawrence Berkeley Lab., LBL-32758; Hall, D.O., Mynick, H.E., Williams, R.H., Cooling the Greenhouse with Bioenergy,"" (1991) Nature, 353, pp. 11-12; Harmon, M.E., Ferrel, W.K., Franklin, J.F., Effects on Carbon Storage of Old-Growth Forests Converted to Young Forests (1990) Science, 247, pp. 699-702; Houghton, R.A., Boone, R.D., Fruci, J.R., Hobbie, I.E., Melillo, J.M., Palm, C.A., Peterson, B.J., Woodwell, G.M., The Flux of Carbon from Terrestrial Ecosystems to the Atmosphere in 1980 Due to Changes in Land Use (1987) Tellus, 39 B, pp. 122-139; (1995) Methods for Assessment of Mitigation Options, , IPCC Working Group II, UNEP, Geneva; Klein-Goldewijk, K., Van Minnen, J.G., Kreileman, G.J.J., Vloedbeld, M., Leemans, R., Simulating the Carbon Flux between the Terrestrial Environment and the Atmosphere (1994) Water, Air and Soil Pollution, 76, pp. 199-230; Marland, G., Marland, S., Should We Store Carbon in Trees?
