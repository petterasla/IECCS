Through analyzing the weather observation stations surrounding Taklimakan Desert, the climate record of Hotan station was chosen to be the representative of low altitudes. Wavelet analysis were used to investigate the climatic variations of patterns, cycles and frequencies of different altitudes from 1954 to 1992, and different responses of different altitude surrounding Taklimakan Desert to global warming were recorded: (1) coherent decline of snow accumulation rate and dust deposition of high altitude recorded in Chongce ice core; (2) coherent increase of summer half-year precipitation and SAT of Hotan; (3) consistent variation tendency between dust deposit recorded in Chongce ice core and Hotan spring sandstorm days; (4) opposite variation tendency between Hotan precipitation and Chongce ice core snow accumulation rate and consistent cycles in general. By analyzing the mechanism of different responses, the predominant factors were determined of different altitudes: (1) at the low altitude, the vapor supply is predominant, and more vapor supplying means more precipitation; (2) at the high altitude, probably the population of dust aerosols which act as cloud ice nuclei in high altitude takes advantage over the vapor supply to affect the precipitation, and so the dust aerosol population reducing results in the wet deposition being reduced, thus the dust aerosol is the predominant factor. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Climatology; Global warming","Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Climatology; Dust; Frequency response; Global warming; Ice; Landforms; Meteorology; Precipitation (meteorology); Snow; Vapors; Climate proxies; Climate records; Climatic variations; Consistent variations; Dust aerosols; Dust depositions; Dust deposits; Global climate changes; High altitudes; Ice cores; Ice nucleus; Low altitudes; Snow accumulations; Weather observations; Wet depositions; Climate change; climate variation; climatology; dust; global climate; global warming; ice cap; precipitation intensity; proxy climate record; snow accumulation; wavelet analysis; weather station; wet deposition; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Taklimakan Desert; Xinjiang Uygur",,,,,,"Chen, S.B., Liu, Y.F., Thomas, A., Climatic change on the Tibetan Plateau: Potential evapotranspiration trends from 1961-2000 (2006) Clim Change, 76, pp. 291-319. , doi: 10.1007/s10584-006-9080-z; Dansgaard, W., Johnsen, S.J., Clausen, H.B., Stable isotope glaciology (1973) Meddelelser Grφnland, 197, pp. 1-53. , 2; Geng, K.H., (1985)Han, J.-K., Nakawo, M., Goto-Azuma, K., Zhang, W.C., Dating of a shallow ice core from Chongce ice cap using micro-particle content (2005) J Glaciol Geocryol, 27 (6), pp. 846-452. , (Chinese version with English abstract); Han, J.-K., Nakawo, M., Goto-Azuma, K., Lu, C., Impact of air burden fine dust on the mass balance of a high mountainous glacier: A case study of Chongce ice cap, west Kunlun Shan, China (2006) Ann Glaciol, 43, pp. 23-28; He, Q., Yang, Q., Li, H.J., Variations of air temperature, precipitation and sand-dust weather in Xinjiang in past 40 years (2003) J Glaciol Geocryol, 25, pp. 425-427. , 2.
