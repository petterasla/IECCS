The upper timberline is likely to migrate upward in elevation in response to temperature changes, whereas the lower treeline may retreat under drier conditions or move down slope under wetter conditions. In all scenarios, the extent of alpine vegetation in the ecosystem decreased. Climate-induced changes in the fire regime would probably have substantial consequences for the extent and age-class distribution of forest communities. Alterations in the distribution and extent of grassland communities would affect the populations of large ungulates. Analyses suggest directions for establishing long-term measurements for the early detection of responses to climate change. -from Authors",,"alpine; climatic change; grassland; timberline; USA, Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park; Ungulata",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026293328
