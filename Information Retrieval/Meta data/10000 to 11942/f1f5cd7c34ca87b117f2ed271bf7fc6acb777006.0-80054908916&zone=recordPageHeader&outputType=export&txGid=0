In this study, we use satellite derived NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data to explore the spatio-temporal changes in the timing of spring vegetation green-up in the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau from 1982 to 2006 and to characterize their relationship with elevation and temperature using concurrent satellite and climate data sets. At the regional scale, no statistically significant trend of the vegetation green-up date is observed during the whole study period (R2=0.00, P=0.95). Two distinct periods of green-up changes are identified. From 1982 to 1999, the vegetation green-up significantly advanced by 0.88daysyear-1 (R2=0.56, P&lt;0.001). In contrast, from 1999 to 2006, a marginal delaying trend is evidenced (R2=0.44, P=0.07), suggesting that the persistent trend towards earlier vegetation green-up in spring between 1980s and 1990s was stalled during the first decade of this century. This shift in the tendency of the vegetation green-up seems to be related to differing temperature trends between these two periods. Statistical analysis shows that the average onset of vegetation green-up over the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau would advance by about 4.1 days in response to 1°C increase of spring temperature. In addition, results from our analysis indicate that the spatial patterns of the vegetation green-up date and its change since 1982 are altitude dependent. The magnitude of the vegetation green-up advancement during 1982-1999, and of its postponement from 1999 to 2006 significantly increases along an increasing elevation gradient. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Elevation gradient;
