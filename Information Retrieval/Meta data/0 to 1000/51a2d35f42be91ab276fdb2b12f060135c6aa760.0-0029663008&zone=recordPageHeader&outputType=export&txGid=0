Box 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543, United States","It may be possible to sequester carbon in forests and forest products, but to date global trends in land management have resulted in a release of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere. Over 100 PgC were released between 1850 and 1980, and during the 1980s global changes in land use (predominantly deforestation) caused a net release of 1.6 PgC yr -1, about 25% of the total emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities and about 15% of the enhanced radiative forcing. Management practices that could change this release of terrestrial carbon to an accumulation include (i) a halt to deforestation; (ii) an expansion in the land area of forests; (iii) an increase in the stocks of carbon in existing forests; (iv) more efficient harvest and greater use of wood in long-lasting products; and (v) the substitution of wood fuels for fossil fuels. However, the rate of global warming needs management as well. Unless the warming is gradual enough to avoid widespread mortality of forests, the additional releases of carbon caused by the warming itself, through increased respiration, decay, and fires, may cancel the intended effects of forest management.",,"carbon sink; forest management; global warming; terrestrial ecosystem",,,,,,"Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, J.J., (1990) Climate Change.
