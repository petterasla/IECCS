Carbon sequestration potential should result from phytomass stock expansion, and in this study, the potential of phytomass stock expansion due to afforestation/rehabilitation with additional special water management was estimated by using several sets of global geographical information systems (GIS) data. The estimation was conducted under unified conditions for all the world areas by using a computer program based on the GIS data. The carbon sequestration potential of a land area was assumed to be primarily determined by its precipitation level if the area satisfied certain meteorological and geographical conditions for phytomass stock expansion, such as land use, temperature, slope, and soil type, and the sensitivities of these conditions were studied. The carbon sequestration potential due to regular afforestation/rehabilitation was estimated to be about 169 GtC in the world, and the effective regions for carbon sequestration were Brazil, etc. On the other hand, the increase in the carbon sequestration potential due to the additional special water management was estimated to be about 21 GtC in the world, and the effective regions were Saudi Arabia, west Australia, etc. © 2011 The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.","Biomass; Carbon sequestration; Forest management; Geographical information systems; Water management","Australia; Biomass utilization; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Computer program; Energy use; Geographical conditions; Geographical Information System; Geographical information systems; GIS data; Land areas; Phytomass; Precipitation level; Saudi Arabia; Soil types; Biomass; Carbon; Expansion; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Information management; Information systems; Water management; Forestry; Australia; Biomass; Carbon; Chelation; Expansion; Forest Management; Forestry; GIS; Saudi Arabia; Water Management",,,,,,"Bazilevich, N.I., Global Primary Productivity, Phytomass, Net Primary Production, and Mortmass (2001) Global Ecosystems Database Version 2.0, , http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ecosys/cdroms/ged_iib/datasets/b02/baz.htm, NOAA National Geographical Data Center, Boulder, U.S.A; Bolin, B., Sukumar, R., (2000) Global Perspective, , Watson R. and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change eds., Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K; (2001) AARS Global 4-Minute Land Cover, , http://ceres.cr.chiba-u.ac.jp:8080/usr-dir/you/ICHP/index.html, Chiba University, Center for Environmental Remote Sensing (CEReS); Fitter, A.H., Hay, R.K.M., (1981) Environmental Physiology of Plants, , Academic Press, Maryland Heights, U.S.A; Grainger, A., Estimating Areas of Degraded Tropical Lands Requiring Replenishment of Forest Cover (1988) International Tree Crops Journal, 5, pp. 31-61; Houghton, R.A., Unruh, J.D., Lefebvre, P.A., Current Land Cover in the Tropics and Its Potential for Sequestering Carbon (1993) Global Biogeochem.
