Global climate change may lead to a change in the predictive value of temperature for seasonal conditions, potentially resulting in a mismatch of phenotypic form and environment. The afrotropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows striking seasonal plasticity for wing patterns and life history traits. This polyphenism is an adaptation to contrasting patterns of rainfall over wet and dry seasons, and is mainly determined by temperature. To investigate the extent of local adaptation of the developmental plasticity response to regional climate, we compared the thermal reaction norms for several life history traits and wing pattern of 2 distant populations from regions with different temperature - rainfall associations. We found little to no population differentiation for the life history traits, while wing pattern showed substantially more geographic variation. Broad-sense heritabilities and cross-environment correlations for wing pattern and 2 life history traits indicated a potential for adaptation of the plasticity response of these traits. Our results indicate that thermal plasticity of wing pattern can be population-specific; thus climate change may lead to a mismatch of wing pattern to seasonal environment. Traits that can be further modified by acclimation during the butterfly's adult life span (starvation resistance, resting metabolic rate and egg size) showed no geographic differentiation for their developmental plasticity. This indicates that for these traits, adult acclimation plays an important role in coping with local climate. © Inter-Research 2010.","Acclimation; Bicyclus aynana; Developmental plasticity; Geographic variation; Life history; Seasonal polyphenism; Temperature; Wing pattern","Acclimation; Bicyclus aynana; Developmental plasticity; Geographic variation; Life history; Seasonal polyphenism; Association reactions; Forestry; Plasticity; Plasticity testing; Rain; Climate change; acclimation; butterfly; climate change; developmental biology; environmental cue; geographical variation; life history trait; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; temperature effect; wing; Bicyclus; Bicyclus anynana; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Beldade, P., Brakefield, P.M., The genetics and evo-devo of butterfly wing patterns (2002) Nat Rev Genet, 3, pp. 442-452; Brakefield, P.M., Frankino, W.A., Polyphenisms in Lepidoptera: Multidisciplinary approaches to studies of evolution (2009) Phenotypic Plasticity in Insects: Mechanisms and Consequences, pp. 121-152. , Whitman DW, Ananthakrishnan TN (eds), Science Publishers, Plymouth; Brakefield, P.M., Larsen, T.B., The evolutionary significance of dry and wet season forms in some tropical butterflies (1984) Biol J Linn Soc, 22, pp. 1-12; Brakefield, P.M., Reitsma, N., Phenotypic plasticity, seasonal climate and the population biology of Bicyclus butterflies (Satyridae) in Malawi (1991) Ecol Entomol, 16, pp. 291-303; Brakefield, P.M., Pijpe, J., Zwaan, B.J., Developmental plasticity and acclimation both contribute to adaptive responses to alternating seasons of plenty and of stress in Bicyclus butterflies (2007) J Biosci, 32, pp. 465-475; Breuker, C.J., Brakefield, P.M., Female choice depends on size but not symmetry of dorsal eyespots in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana (2002) Proc R Soc Lond B, 269, pp. 1233-1239; Chown, S.L., Hoffmann, A.A., Kristensen, T.N., Angilletta Jr., M.J., Stenseth, N.C., Pertoldi, C., Adapting to climate change: A perspective from evolutionary physiology (2010) Clim Res, 43, pp. 3-15; De Jong, G., Phenotypic plasticity as a product of selection in a variable environment (1995) Am Nat, 145, pp. 493-512; Dixon, A.F.G., Kindlmann, P., Population dynamics of aphids (1999) Insect Populations, pp. 207-230. , Dempster JP, MacLean IFG (eds), Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Endler, J.A., (1986) Natural Selection in the Wild, , Princeton University, Princeton, NJ; Falconer, D.S., Mackay, T.F.C., (1996) Introduction to Quantitative Genetics, , Longman, Harlow; Fischer, K., Karl, I., Exploring plastic and genetic responses to temperature variation using copper butterflies (2010) Clim Res, 43, pp. 17-30; Fischer, K., Eenhoorn, E., Bot, A.N.M., Brakefield, P.M., Zwaan, B.J., Cooler butterflies lay larger eggs: Developmental plasticity versus acclimation (2003) Proc R Soc Lond B, 270, pp. 2051-2056; Fry, J.D., The mixed-model analysis of variance applied to quantitative genetics: Biological meaning of the parameters (1992) Evolution, 46, pp. 540-550; Gotthard, K., Nylin, S., Adaptive plasticity and plasticity as an adaptation: A selective review of plasticity in animal morphology and life history (1995) Oikos, 74 (1), pp. 3-17; Hoffmann, A.A., Harshman, L.G., Desiccation and starvation resistance in Drosophila: Patterns of variation at the species, population and intrapopulation levels (1999) Heredity, 83, pp. 637-643; Hoffmann, A.A., Hallas, R., Sinclair, C., Mitrovski, P., Levels of variation in stress resistance in Drosophila among strains, local populations, and geographic regions: Patterns for desiccation, starvation, cold resistance, and associated traits (2001) Evolution, 55, pp. 1621-1630; Houle, D., Comparing evolvability and variability of quantitative traits (1992) Genetics, 130, pp. 195-204; Kingsolver, J.G., Experimental manipulation of wing pattern and survival in western white butterflies (1996) Am Nat, 147, pp. 296-306; Kooi, R.E., Brakefield, P.M., The critical period for wing pattern induction in the polyphenic tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) (1999) J Insect Physiol, 45, pp. 201-212; Leroi, A.M., Bennett, A.F., Lenski, R.E., Temperature acclimation and competitive fitness: An experimental test of the beneficial acclimation assumption (1994) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 91, pp. 1917-1921; Lyytinen, A., Brakefield, P.M., Lindstrom, L., Mappes, J., Does predation maintain eyespot plasticity in Bicyclus anynana?
