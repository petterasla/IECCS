However, previous studies have not estimated latitudinal patterns in the phenological response directly. We hypothesized that the phenological response of plants varies with latitude, and estimated the phenological response to long-term climate change using autumn phenological events that have been delayed by recent climate change. Location: Japan. Methods: We used a 53-year data set to document the latitudinal patterns in the climate responses of the timing of autumn leaf colouring and fall for two tree species over a wide range of latitudes in Japan (31 to 44°.N). We calculated single regression slopes for leaf phenological timing and air temperature across Japan and tested their latitudinal patterns using regression models. The effects of latitude, time and their interaction on the responses of the phenological timings were also estimated using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Our results showed that single regression slopes of leaf phenological timing and air temperature in autumn were positive at most stations. Higher temperatures can delay the timing of leaf phenology. Negative relationships were found between the phenological response of leaves to temperature and latitude. Single regression slopes of the phenological responses at lower latitudes were larger than those at higher latitudes. Main conclusions: We found negative relationships between leaf phenological responsiveness and latitude. These findings will be important for predicting phenological timing with global climate change. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Air temperature; Ginkgo; Japan; Latitude; Maple; Phenology; Spatial variation","air temperature; autumn; climate change; environmental effect; estimation method; global climate; latitudinal gradient; leaf; phenology; regression analysis; spatial variation; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Acer; Ginkgo biloba",,,,,,"Chen, X.Q., Pan, W.F., Relationships among phenological growing season, time-integrated normalized difference vegetation index and climate forcing in the temperate region of eastern China (2002) International Journal of Climatology, 22, pp. 1781-1792; Doi, H., Winter flowering phenology of Japanese apricot Prunus mume reflects climate change across Japan (2007) Climate Research, 34, pp. 99-104; Doi, H., Katano, I., Phenological timings of leaf budburst with climate change in Japan (2008) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 148, pp. 512-516; Doi, H., Gordo, O., Katano, I., Heterogeneous intra-annual climatic changes drive different phenological responses in two trophic levels (2008) Climate Research, , in press; Estrella, N., Menzel, A., Responses of leaf colouring in four deciduous tree species to climate and weather in Germany (2006) Climate Research, 32, pp. 253-267; Forsythe, W.C., Rykiel Jr., E.J., Stahl, R.S., Wu, H., Schoolfield, R.M., A model comparison for daylength as a function of latitude and day of year (1995) Ecological Modelling, 80, pp. 87-95; Gordo, O., Sanz, J.J., Phenology and climate change: A long-term study in a Mediterranean locality (2005) Oecologia, 146, pp. 484-495; (1985) Guidelines for the Observation of Phenology, , JMA 3rd edn.
