Willow energy crops are being developed in the northeast US as a fuel source for increasing biomass energy and bioproduct demands. A life cycle inventory is presented that characterizes the full cradle-to-grave energy and environmental performance of willow biomass-to-electricity. A willow biomass production model is developed using demonstration-scale field experience from New York. Scenarios are presented that mimic anticipated cofiring operations, including supplemental use of wood residues, at an existing coal-fired generating facility. At a cofiring rate of 10% biomass, the system net energy ratio (electricity delivered divided by total fossil fuel consumed) increases by 8.9% and net global warming potential decreases by 7-10%. Net SO2 emissions are reduced by 9.5% and a significant reduction in NOx emissions is expected. In addition, we estimate system performance of using willow biomass in dedicated biomass gasification and direct-fired generating facilities and demonstrate that the pollution avoided (relative to the current electricity grid) is comparable to other renewables such as PV and wind. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
