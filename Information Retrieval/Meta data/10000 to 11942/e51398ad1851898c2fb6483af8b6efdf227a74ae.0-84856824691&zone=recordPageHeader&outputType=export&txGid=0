We undertook an investigation of decades scale change in the distributions of saltmarsh communities defined by dominant species, using historic vegetation maps, remote sensing imagery and extensive field data collection. Our study area in south-eastern Tasmania has suffered a marked increase in temperatures and wind speeds and a marked decrease in rainfall since 1975, with sea level rising at a rate of 0.8mm per annum. We therefore tested the hypothesis that these changes would result in a shift in saltmarsh community composition towards more salt- and inundation-tolerant communities and salt scalds. Eighteen percent of the 1975 marsh was lost to direct human modification and a net 4% was lost to coastal retreat. One large marsh was cut off from the sea then burned, then reconnected with the sea. The vegetation change between 1975 and 2009 in other parts of the saltmarshes occurred in 21% of their 1975 area. Most of the community transitions were consistent with increasing aridity. Thus, our results indicate that global warming has already caused marked changes in community composition in saltmarsh in Tasmania. © 2011 CSIRO.",,"aridity; climate change; community composition; global warming; remote sensing; salinity tolerance; saltmarsh; satellite imagery; sea level change; vulnerability; wind velocity; Australia; Tasmania",,,,,,"Adam, P., Saltmarshes in a time of change (2002) Environmental Conservation, 29 (1), pp. 39-61. , DOI 10.1017/S0376892902000048; Allen, J.R.L., Pye, K., Coastal saltmarshes: their nature and importance (1992) Saltmarshes, pp. 1-18; Bertness, M.D., Pennings, S.C., Spatial variation in process and pattern in salt marsh plant communities in eastern North America (2000) Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology, pp. 39-57. , (Eds MP Weinstein, DA Kreeger), Kluwer Academic Publishers: Dordrecht; Bromberg, K.D., Bertness, M.D., Reconstructing New England salt marsh losses using historical maps (2005) Estuaries, 28 (6), pp. 823-832; Bromberg Gedan, K., Silliman, B.R., Bertness, M.D., Centuries of human-driven change in salt marsh ecosystems (2009) Annual Review of Marine Science, 1, pp. 117-141. , doi:10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163930; Castro, P., Freitas, H., Anthropogenic effects and salt marsh loss in the Mondego and Mira estuaries (Portugal) (2006) Web Ecology, 6, pp. 59-66. , http://www.oikos.ekol.lu.se/wepdfs/Web_Ecol.6.59-66.pdf; Civco, D.L., Kennard, W.C., Lefor, M.W., Changes in Connecticut salt-marsh vegetation as revealed by historical aerial photographs and computer-assisted cartographics (1986) Environmental Management, 10, pp. 229-239. , doi:10.1007/BF01867361; Cooper, N.J., Cooper, T., Burd, F., 25 years of salt marsh erosion in Essex: Implications for coastal defence and nature conservation (2001) Journal of Coastal Conservation, 7 (1), pp. 31-40; Day Jr., J.W., Scarton, F., Rismondo, A., Are, D., Rapid deterioration of a salt marsh in Venice Lagoon, Italy (1998) Journal of Coastal Research, 14 (2), pp. 583-590; Donnelly, J.P., Bertness, M.D., Rapid shoreward encroachment of salt marsh cordgrass in response to accelerated sea-level rise (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 98 (25), pp. 14218-14223. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.251209298; Field, R.T., Philipp, K.R., Vegetation changes in the freshwater tidal marsh of the delaware estuary (2000) Wetlands Ecology and Management, 8 (2-3), pp. 79-88; Glasby, J., (1975) Distribution of Saltmarsh Communities in the Hobart Area, , BSc (Hons) Thesis, University of Tasmania: Hobart; Higinbotham, C.B., Alber, M., Chalmers, A.G., Analysis of tidal marsh vegetation patterns in two Georgia estuaries using aerial photography and GIS (2004) Estuaries, 27 (4), pp. 670-683; Hunter, J., Coleman, R., Pugh, D., The sea level at Port Arthur, Tasmania, from 1841 to the present (2003) Geophysical Research Letters, 30, p. 1401. , doi:10.1029/2002GL016813; Jensen, A., The effect of cattle and sheep grazing on salt-marsh vegetation at Skallingen, Denmark (1985) Vegetatio, 60 (1), pp. 37-48; Kirkpatrick, J.B., Glasby, J., (1981) Salt Marshes in Tasmania: Distribution, Community Composition and Conservation', , Occasional Paper 8.
