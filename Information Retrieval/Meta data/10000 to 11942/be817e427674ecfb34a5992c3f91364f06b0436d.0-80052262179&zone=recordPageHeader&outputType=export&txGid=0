Thus, solar radiation management ""geoengineering"" proposals to completely offset global mean temperature increases by reducing the amount of absorbed sunlight might be expected to slow the global water cycle and reduce runoff over land. However, proposed countering of global warming by increasing the albedo of marine clouds would reduce surface solar radiation only over the oceans. Here, for an idealized scenario, we analyze the response of temperature and the hydrological cycle to increased reflection by clouds over the ocean using an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model. When cloud droplets are reduced in size over all oceans uniformly to offset the temperature increase from a doubling of atmospheric CO2, the global-mean precipitation and evaporation decreases by about 1.3% but runoff over land increases by 7.5% primarily due to increases over tropical land. In the model, more reflective marine clouds cool the atmospheric column over ocean. The result is a sinking motion over oceans and upward motion over land. We attribute the increased runoff over land to this increased upward motion over land when marine clouds are made more reflective. Our results suggest that, in contrast to other proposals to increase planetary albedo, offsetting mean global warming by reducing marine cloud droplet size does not necessarily lead to a drying, on average, of the continents. However, we note that the changes in precipitation, evaporation and P-E are dominated by small but significant areas, and given the highly idealized nature of this study, a more thorough and broader assessment would be required for proposals of altering marine cloud properties on a large scale. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Climate change; Geoengineering; Global warming; Hydrological cycle; Marine cloud-albedo enhancement; Solar radiation management","air temperature; albedo; atmospheric general circulation model; cloud microphysics; cloud radiative forcing; droplet; evaporation; global warming; hydrological cycle; marine atmosphere; precipitation (climatology); runoff; solar radiation",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Ingram, W.J., Constraints on future changes in climate and the hydrologic cycle (2002) Nature, 419 (6903), pp. 224-232; Andrews, T., Forster, P.M., Gregory, J.M., A surface energy perspective on climate change (2009) J Clim, 22, pp. 2557-2570; Angel, R., Feasibility of cooling the earth with a cloud of small spacecraft near the inner Lagrange point (L1) (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103 (46), pp. 17184-17189; Bala, G., Problems with geoengineering schemes to combat climate change (2009) Curr Sci, 96 (1), pp. 41-48; Bala, G., Duffy, P.B., Taylor, K.E., Impact of geoengineering schemes on the global hydrological cycle (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105 (22), pp. 7664-7669; Bala, G., Caldeira, K., Nemani, R., Fast versus slow response in climate change: Implications for the global hydrological cycle (2009) Clim Dyn, , doi: 10. 1007/s00382-009-0583-y; Bengtsson, L., Geo-engineering to confine climate change: is it at all feasible?
