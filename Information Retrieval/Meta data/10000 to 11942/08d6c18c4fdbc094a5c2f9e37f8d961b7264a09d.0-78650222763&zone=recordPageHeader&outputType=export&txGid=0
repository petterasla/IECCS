To combat unprecedented global warming and to mitigate future energy challenges, there is worldwide interest in utilization of renewable sources of energy such as solar-photovoltaic (solar-PV) and wind energy. Other driving forces paving avenue for renewable energy include rapid escalation in oil prices, growing concerns regarding depletion of oil/gas reserves, etc. Retrofitting of diesel systems with hybrid wind-PV-diesel systems is being widely disseminated to reduce diesel fuel consumption and to minimize atmospheric degradation. One of the potential market for deployment of hybrid systems is in remote locations which are driven by diesel generators. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a number of remote villages scattered all over the Kingdom. The aim of this study is to analyze wind speed and solar radiation data of Rafha, KSA, and to assess the technical and economic potential of hybrid wind-PV-diesel power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical remote village Rawdhat Bin Habbas (RBH) with annual electrical energy demand of 15,943 MWh. Rafha is located near RBH. The monthly average wind speeds range from 2.99 m/s to 4.84 m/s at 10 m height. The monthly average daily global solar radiation ranges from 3.04 to 7.3 kWh/sq.m. The hybrid systems simulated consist of different combinations of 600 kW wind machines, PV panels, supplemented by diesel generators. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) software has been used to perform the techno-economic study. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system comprising of 1.2 MW wind farm capacity (two 600 kW units, 50 m hub-height) and 1.2 MW of PV capacity together with 4.5 MW diesel system (three 1.5 MW units), the renewable energy fraction with 0% annual capacity shortage is 24% (10% wind + 14% PV). The cost of generating energy (COE) from this hybrid wind-PV-diesel system has been found to be 0.118 $/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1$/l). The study exhibits that for a given hybrid configuration, the number of operational hours of diesel generators decreases with increase in wind farm and PV capacity. Attention has also been focused on wind/PV penetration, unmet load, excess electricity generation, percentage of fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (relative to diesel-only situation) of different hybrid systems, cost breakdown of wind-PV-diesel systems, COE of different hybrid systems, etc. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon emissions; Diesel generators; Hybrid systems; PV; Remote loads; Wind turbines","Annual capacity; Atmospheric degradation; Carbon emissions; Climatic anomalies; Cold winter; Daily global solar radiation; Diesel generators; Driving forces; Economic potentials; Electrical energy demand; Electricity generation; Fuel savings; Hub height; Hybrid configurations; Hybrid optimization; Hybrid wind; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Off-grid electrification; Oil Prices; Potential markets; Power systems; PV; PV panel; PV-diesel systems; Remote loads; Remote location; Remote villages; Renewable energies; Renewable sources; Renewables; Saudi Arabia; Simulation result; Solar radiation data; Techno-economic studies; Techno-economics; Wind energy; Wind farm; Wind farm capacity; Wind machines; Wind speed; Costs; Diesel fuels; Economic analysis; Electric generators; Electric grounding; Electric utilities; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Global warming; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Retrofitting; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Storms; Sun; Wind power; Wind turbines; Solar energy; carbon emission; diesel; electricity generation; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; rural electrification; solar power; village; wind turbine; Saudi Arabia",,,,,,"Ali, S., Global progress in renewable energy 2001 (2001) Proceedings of Abstracts of 7th ArabInternational Solar Energy Conference, p. 4. , 19-22 February 2001, Sharjah, UAE; Amr, M., Petersen, H.S.M., Habali, S.M., Assessment of windfarm economics in relationto site wind resources applied to sites in Jordan (1990) Solar Energy, 45 (3), pp. 167-175; Bellarmine, T.G., Joe, U., Wind energy for the 1990s and beyond (1996) Energy Conversion and Management, 37 (12), pp. 741-752; Bergey, M., Village electrification Hybrid systems (1993) Wind Energy Applications and TrainingSymposium, , 7 July 1993, Amarillo, Texas; Beyer, G.H., Langer, C., A method for the identification of configurations of pv/windhybrid systems for the reliable supply of small loads (1996) Solar Energy, 57 (5), pp. 381-391; Chadjivassiliadis, J., Solar photovoltaic and wind power in Greece (1987) IEEE Proceedings A Science, Measurement & Technology, 134 (5), pp. 457-463; Douglas, B., The essence way renewable energy system (1997) Solar Today, May/June, pp. 16-19; Dubois, A., Boyle, G., Dichler, A., Design and operation of a solar photovoltaic-windenergy cogeneration system for a group of houses.
