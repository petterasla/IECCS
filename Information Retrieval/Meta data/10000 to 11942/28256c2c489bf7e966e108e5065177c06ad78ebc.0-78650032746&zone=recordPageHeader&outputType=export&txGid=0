Warm season air temperature was the leading climatic factor influencing ELA variations. The glacier ELA ascends (descends) 172 m when warm season air temperature increases (decreases) by 1°C, and ascends (descends) 62 m when cold season precipitation decreases (increases) by 10%. In the period 1958-2008, the glacier ELA showed a general increasing trend, ascending 230 m and reaching its highest altitude in 2006 at 5131 m a. s. l., close to the glacier summit. If future climate is similar to that in the period 2001-2008, the Qiyi Glacier will not stabilize until it retreats by 2.08 km. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","ELA; global warming; Qilian Mountains; Qiyi Glacier",,,,,,,"Poter, S.C., Equilibrium-line altitudes of late Quaternary glaciers in Southern Alps, New Zealand (1975) Quat Res, 5, pp. 27-47; Nesje, A., Younger Dryas and Holocene glacier fluctuations and equilibrium-line altitude variations in the Jostedalsbre region, western Norway (1992) Clim Dyn, 6, pp. 221-227; Rodbell, D.T., Late Pleistocene equilibrium-line reconstructions in the northern Peruvian Andes (1992) Boreas, 21, pp. 43-52; Ballantyne, C., The Loch Lomond readvance on the Isle of Mull, Scotland: Glacier reconstruction and palaoclimatic implications (2002) J Quat Sci, 17, pp. 759-771; Kovanen, D.J., Slaymaker, O., Fluctuations of the Deming Glacier and theoretical equilibrium line altitudes during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene on Mount Baker, Washington, USA (2005) Boreas, 34, pp. 157-175; Kayastha, R.B., Harrrison, S.P., Changes of the equilibrium-line altitude since the Little Ice Age in the Nepalese Himalaya (2008) Ann Glaciol, 48, pp. 93-99; Zhang, Z.S., Change of snowline at the source area of the Urumqi River, Tianshan Mountains (in Chinese) (1981) J Glaciol Geocryol, 3 (SUPPL), pp. 106-112; Feng, Z.D., Last Glacial snowlines in the Tibetan Plateau: An argument against an extensive coalescing icesheet (1998) GeoJournal, 44, pp. 355-362; Shi, Y.F., Zheng, B.X., Su, Z., Glaciations, glacial-interglacial cycles and environmental changes in the Quaternary (in Chinese) (2000) Glaciers and Their Environments in China, pp. 320-355. , Y.
