We present a conceptual framework, based on past investigations and ecological theory, for predicting the consequences of this underappreciated aspect of climate change. We consider a broad range of terrestrial ecosystems that vary in their overall water balance. More extreme rainfall regimes are expected to increase the duration and severity of soil water stress in mesic ecosystems as intervals between rainfall events increase. In contrast, xeric ecosystems may exhibit the opposite response to extreme events. Larger but less frequent rainfall events may result in proportional reductions in evaporative losses in xeric systems, and thus may lead to greater soil water availability. Hydric (wetland) ecosystems are predicted to experience reduced periods of anoxia in response to prolonged intervals between rainfall events. Understanding these contingent effects of ecosystem water balance is necessary for predicting how more extreme precipitation regimes will modify ecosystem processes and alter interactions with related global change drivers. © 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Climate change; Drought; Ecosystems; Precipitation; Soil water",,,,,,,"Amundson, R., Jenny, H., On a state factor model of ecosystems (1997) BioScience, 47, pp. 536-543; Augustine, D.J., McNaughton, S.J., Interactive effects of ungulate herbivores, soil fertility, and variable rainfall on ecosystem processes in a semi-arid savanna (2006) Ecosystems, 9, pp. 1242-1256; Austin, A.T., Yahdjian, L., Stark, J.M., Belnap, J., Porporato, A., Norton, U., Ravetta, D.A., Schaeffer, S.M., Water pulses and biogeochemical cycles in arid and semiarid ecosystems (2004) Oecologia, 141, pp. 221-235; Beier, C., Novel approaches to study climate change effects on terrestrial ecosystems in the field: Drought and passive nighttime warming (2004) Ecosystems, 7, pp. 583-597; Belnap, J., Phillips, S.L., Miller, M.E., Response of desert biological soil crusts to alterations in precipitation frequency (2004) Oecologia, 141, pp. 306-316; Bennett, E.M., Peterson, G.D., Levitt, E.A., Looking to the future of ecosystem services (2005) Ecosystems, 8, pp. 125-132; Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Collins, M., Harris, P.P., Huntingford, C., Jones, C.D., The role of ecosystem-atmosphere interactions in simulated Amazonian precipitation decrease and forest dieback under global climate warming (2004) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 78, pp. 157-175; Brady, N.C., Weil, R.R., (2002) The Nature and Properties of Soils, , 13th ed.
