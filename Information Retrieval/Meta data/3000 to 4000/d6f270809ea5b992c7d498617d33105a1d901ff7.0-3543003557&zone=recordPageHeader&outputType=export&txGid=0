Temperature and influxes of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) were manipulated in a factorial design. The mean daily air temperature was increased by 3.6°C with glasshouse enclosures. Nitrogen loads were increased 15-fold and S loads seven-fold compared with the natural loads up to influxes observed during the 1980s in south-western Sweden. Production of S. balticum decreased with increasing temperature and N-influx. The N treatment significantly reduced the incremental length of S. balticum, and this reduction was reinforced with time (24% in the first year to 51% in the final year). The area covered by S. lindbergii changed with time in all treatments and S. papillosum area increased significantly in the temperature-treated plots. Growth, production and competitive patterns change if the environmental conditions change. Increased N deposition and raised temperature may transform mires currently dominated by Sphagnum into vascular-plant-dominated mires. © New Phytologist (2004).","Acidification; Competition; Global warming; Nitrogen deposition; Peatlands; Production; Sphagnum","growth; interspecific competition; mire; nitrogen; primary production; sulfur; temperature effect; Sphagnum; Sphagnum balticum; Sphagnum lindbergii; Sphagnum papillosum; Tracheophyta",,,,,,"Aerts, R., Chapain III, F.S., The mineral nutrition of wild plants revisited: A re-evaluation of processes and patterns (2000) Advances in Ecological Research, 30, pp. 1-67; Aerts, R., Wallén, B., Malmer, N., Growth-limiting nutrients in Sphagnum-dominated bogs subject to low and high atmospheric nitrogen supply (1992) Journal of Ecology, 80, pp. 131-140; Aerts, R., Wallén, B., Malmer, N., De Caluwe, H., Nutritional constraints on Sphagnum-growth and potential decay in northern peatlands (2001) Journal of Ecology, 89, pp. 292-299; Aldous, A.R., Nitrogen translocation in Sphagnum mosses: Effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition (2002) New Phytologist, 156, pp. 241-253; Alexandersson, H., Karlström, C., Larsson-McCann, S., Temperature and precipitation in Sweden 1961-90.
