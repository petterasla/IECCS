We investigated the effects of elevated CO2, N deposition, warming and increased precipitation on the composition of organic compounds in plant litter in a fully-factorial experiment conducted in a California annual grassland. While lignin increased within functional groups under elevated CO2, this effect was attenuated by warming in grasses and by water additions in forbs. CO2-induced increases in lignin within functional groups also were counteracted by an increase in the relative biomass of forbs, which contained less lignin than grasses. Consequently, there was no net change in the overall lignin content of senesced tissue at the plot level under elevated CO2. Nitrate additions increased N in both grass and forb litter, although this effect was attenuated by water additions. Relative to changes in N within functional groups, changes in functional group dominance had a minor effect on overall litter N at the plot level. Nitrate additions had the strongest effect on decomposition, increasing lignin losses from Avena litter and interacting with water additions to increase decomposition of litter of other grasses. Increases in lignin that resulted from elevated CO2 had no effect on decomposition but elevated CO2 increased N losses from Avena litter. Overall, the interactions among elements of global change were as important as single-factor effects in influencing plant litter chemistry. However, with the exception of variation in N, litter quality had little influence on decomposition over the short term. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Global warming; Lignin; Precipitation","carbon; carbon dioxide; lignin; nitrogen; atmospheric deposition; carbon dioxide enrichment; decomposition; global change; litter; nitrogen; article; biomass; climate; ecosystem; metabolism; Poaceae; temperature; United States; Biomass; California; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Ecosystem; Lignin; Nitrogen; Poaceae; Temperature; Avena; Poaceae",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon, 7440-44-0; lignin, 9005-53-2; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Lignin, 9005-53-2; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,,"Bernhard-Reversat, F., Main, G., Holl, K., Loumeto, J., Ngao, J., Fast disappearance of the water-soluble phenolic fraction in eucalypt leaf litter during laboratory and field experiments (2003) Appl Soil Ecol, 23, pp. 273-278; Carreiro, M.M., Sinsabaugh, R.L., Repert, D.A., Parkhurst, D.F., Microbial enzyme shifts explain litter decay responses to simulated nitrogen deposition (2000) Ecology, 81, pp. 2359-2365; Chadwick, D.R., Ineson, P., Woods, C., Piearce, T.G., Decomposition of Pinus sylvestris litter in litter bags: Influence of underlying native litter layer (1998) Soil Biol Biochem, 30, pp. 47-55; Cotrufo, M.F., Ineson, P., Rowland, A.P., Decomposition of tree leaf litters grown under elevated CO2 - Effect of litter quality (1994) Plant Soil, 163, pp. 121-130; Cotrufo, M.F., Briones, M.J.I., Ineson, P., Elevated CO2 affects field decomposition rate and palatability of tree leaf litter: Importance of changes in substrate quality (1998) Soil Biol Biochem, 30, pp. 1565-1571; Deschamps, F.C., Effects of growing periods on digestion and chemical composition of elephant grass cultivar tissues (1999) Braz J Anim Sci, 28, pp. 1358-1369; Dukes, J.S., Field, C.B., Diverse mechanisms for CO2 effects on grassland litter decomposition (2000) Global Change Biol, 6, pp. 145-154; Dukes, J.S., Hungate, B.A., Elevated carbon dioxide and litter decomposition in California annual grasslands: Which mechanisms matter?
