It is suggested in this study that natural evaporation can be reduced, that the condensation of water vapor can be promoted, and that a tremendous amount of betterquality water can be generated for future use through the artificial control of ice. It was likewise found that ice that has been increased through ice control reflects more insolation and can suppress global warming. When applied to the central part of Korea, ice control can prevent 614 mm of water from evaporating for eight months, without refrigerating energy. The amount of water that can be prevented from evaporating will reach 438 million tons when applied to Daechung Dam, which has a water surface of 73 km2 and many streams. Furthermore, by using 1 ton of continuously supplied ice, water vapor can be condensed into water resources at a rate of 37,440 g h-1 in 15°C air and 0.5 m s-1 wind. It is also calculated that 4.8 × 106 km2 of additional ice cover can terminate the global warming process. Ice control procedures involving the forced thickening of ice and delayed thawing are introduced herein. The related thermodynamics, simple experiments that were conducted, and observed results are reviewed briefly. To date, no harmful side effects of the use of ice control have been documented.","Evaporation; Global warming; Ice control; Water resources",,,,,,,"Bouchet, R.
