While this soil feedback is expected to be significant because the amount of SOC is substantially more than the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, the environmental dependencies of decomposition at global scales that determine the magnitude of the soil feedback have remained poorly characterized. In this study, we address this issue by fitting a mechanistic decomposition model to a global dataset of SOC, optimizing the model's temperature and moisture dependencies to best match the observed global distribution of SOC. The results of the analysis indicate that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition at global scales (Q10=1.37) is significantly less than is assumed by many terrestrial ecosystem models that directly apply temperature sensitivity from small-scale studies, and that the maximal rate of decomposition occurs at higher moisture values than is assumed by many models. These findings imply that the magnitude of the soil decomposition feedback onto rate of global climate change will be less sensitive to increases in temperature, and modeling of temperature and moisture dependencies of SOC decomposition in global-scale models should consider effects of scale. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Carbon cycling; Climate change; Decomposition; Likelihood; Modeling; Q10","data set; decomposition; environmental conditions; global climate; moisture content; organic carbon; temperature effect; terrestrial ecosystem",,,,,,"Bachelet, D., Lenihan, J.M., Daly, C., Neilson, R.P., Ojima, D.S., Parton, W.J., MC1: A dynamic vegetation model for estimating the distribution of vegetation and associated ecosystem fluxes of carbon, nutrients and water (2001) USDA Forest Service General Technical Report, PNW-GTR-508, pp. 1-95; Bellamy, P.H., Loveland, P.J., Bradley, R.I., Lark, R.M., Kirk, G.J.D., Carbon losses from all soils across England and Wales 1978-2003 (2005) Nature, 437, pp. 245-248; Bolker, B.M., Pacala, S.W., Parton, W.J., Linear analysis of soil decomposition: Insights from the Century model (1998) Ecol Appl, 8, pp. 425-439; Bonan, G.B., Shugart, H.H., Environmental-factors and ecological processes in boreal forests (1989) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 20, pp. 1-28; Burke, I., Kaye, J., Bird, S., Hall, S., McCulley, R., Sommerville, G., Evaluating and testing models of terrestrial biogeochemistry: The role of temperature in controlling decomposition (2003) Models in Ecosystem Science, pp. 225-253. , Canham C, Cole J, Lauenroth W (eds).
