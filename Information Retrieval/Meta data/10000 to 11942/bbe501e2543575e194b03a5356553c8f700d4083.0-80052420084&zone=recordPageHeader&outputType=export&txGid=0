For the same reasons that this site provides excellent globally averaged CO 2 data, it may provide temperature data with global significance. Here, we examine hourly temperature records, averaged annually for 1977-2006, to determine linear trends as a function of time of day. For night-time data (22:00 to 06:00 LST (local standard time)) there is a near-uniform warming of 0.040 °C yr -1. During the day, the linear trend shows a slight cooling of -0.014 °C yr -1 at 12:00 LST (noon). Overall, at Mauna Loa Observatory, there is a mean warming trend of 0.021 °C yr -1. The dominance of night-time warming results in a relatively large annual decrease in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) of -0.050 °C yr -1 over the period 1977-2006. These trends are consistent with the observed increases in the concentrations of CO 2 and its role as a greenhouse gas (demonstrated here by first-order radiative forcing calculations), and indicate the possible relevance of the Mauna Loa temperature measurements to global warming. © Author(s) 2011.",,"air temperature; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); cooling; diurnal variation; global warming; greenhouse gas; observatory; temperature profile; trend analysis; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Mauna Loa Observatory; United States",,,,,,"(2005) Oak Ridge Natl.
