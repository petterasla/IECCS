The insulating role of snow cover was found to be the most important factor, explaining 30-60% of the variance in maximum ice thickness values. Other snow-related processes such as slushing and density variations were estimated to explain a further 15-30% of the variance. In contrast, annual variation in air temperatures explained less than 4% of the variance in maximum ice thickness. Recent ice thinning and thickening trends at two sites (Alert and Resolute) are consistent with changes in the average depth of snow covering the ice and may be explained by changes in cyclone frequencies. A response surface sensitivity analysis indicated the High Arctic landfast ice regime would be more sensitive to air temperature variations under a warmer, snowier environment. -from Authors",,"climate change; ice thickness; interannual variability; landfast ice; snow cover; Canada, Northwest Territories",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00040843,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027087827
