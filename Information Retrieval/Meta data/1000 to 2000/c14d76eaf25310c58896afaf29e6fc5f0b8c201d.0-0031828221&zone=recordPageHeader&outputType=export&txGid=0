L0E 1R0, Canada","Phosphorus concentrations in a 19-year record of the Lake Huron outflow (Laurentian Great Lakes of North America) were negatively correlated with the extent of Great Lakes winter ice cover. The highest phosphorus concentrations (2-3 times higher than normal) occurred during 1983, 1987, and 1992 in response to strong El Nino-related moderation of winter air temperatures. The 1983 winter air temperature anomaly of +2.5°C (the mildest winter in the record) is well within the output of predicted temperature increases by general circulation models for the Great Lakes basin under a 2x CO2 climate warming scenario. Lake data from strong El Nino years, when contrasted with other years having near-normal winter temperatures and ice cover, can thus serve to identify some previously unanticipated impacts of global warming on lake water quality. I suggest that global warming may have important implications for eutrophication control in the Great Lakes.",,,,,,,,,"Nicholls, K.H.; Aquatic Science Section, Standards Development Branch, Ontario Ministry of Environ./Energy, R.
