PCR and DNA sequencing of the basidiomycete communities in paired blocks of uninfected and infected trees revealed: (1) that the top, organic soil layer in this system is inhabited almost exclusively by ectomycorrhizal fungi; (2) no difference in species richness (6 species core-1 in both) or Shannon-Wiener evenness (0.740 and 0.747 in uninfected and infected blocks respectively), however Shannon-Wiener diversity was significantly greater in infected blocks (1.19 vs 1.94 in uninfected and infected blocks respectively, P &lt; 0.05); (3) significant differences in basidiomycete species composition, with nearly complete absence of two system co-dominant Russula species in infected blocks, and replacement of one co-dominant Piloderma species with another in infected plots, indicating physiological variability within the genus. Soil fungal physiological diversity measured using the Fungilog system was significantly greater in terms of both number of carbon substrates used by culturable soil fungi (both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) in infected blocks, and the rate at which these substrates were used. Soil enzyme assays revealed greater laccase, peroxidase, and cellulase activities in soils associated with infected trees. Thus, event cascades associated with severe dwarf mistletoe infection not only significantly affected soil fungal species composition and increased species diversity, but also impacted on carbon-related function and functional diversity. Given the geographic range of this pathogen, and forecasts that epidemics of this disease will increase in range in severity with global climate change, these effects have the potential to significantly impact local and global carbon budgets. © 2010.",,"Biochemical methods; Carbon budgets; Carbon cycling; Carbon substrates; Cellulase activity; Community structures; Culturable; DNA Sequencing; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Functional diversity; Fungal community; Fungal species; Geographic ranges; Global climate changes; Infected trees; Laccases; Organic soil; Physiological diversity; Related functions; Soil enzymes; Soil fungi; Species composition; Species diversity; Species richness; Climate change; Enzymes; Forestry; Gene encoding; Physiology; Soils; Fungi; carbon budget; climate change; ectomycorrhiza; enzyme activity; fungus; hypothesis testing; microbial community; polymerase chain reaction; shrub; soil microorganism; species diversity; species evenness; species richness; Diseases; Enzymes; Forestry; Fungi; Genes; Physiology; Seasonal Variation; Soil; Arceuthobium; Arceuthobium pusillum; Ascomycota; Basidiomycota; Fungi; Piloderma; Russula; Viscum album",,,,,,"Agerer, R., Exploration types of ectomycorrhizal fungi: a proposal to classify ectomycorrhizal mycelial systems according to their patterns of differentiation and putative ecological importance (2001) Mycorrhiza, 11, pp. 107-114; Baier, R., Ingenhaag, J., Blaschke, H., Göttlein, A., Agerer, R., Vertical distribution of an ectomycorrhizal community in upper soil horizons of a young Norway spruce (Picea abies [L] Karst.) stand of the Bavarian Limestone Alps (2006) Mycorrhiza, 16, pp. 197-206; Baldrian, P., Ectomycorrhizal fungi and their enzymes in soils: is there enough evidence for their roles as facultative soil saprotrophs?
