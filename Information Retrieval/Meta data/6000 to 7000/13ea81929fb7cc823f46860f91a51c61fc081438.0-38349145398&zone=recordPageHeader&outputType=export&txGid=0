A combination of energy simulation, life cycle assessment, and operations research techniques are used to develop the model. In addition to conventional energy systems, such as the electric grid and a gas boiler, cogeneration systems which concurrently generate power and heat are investigated as an alternative source of energy. Cogeneration systems appeared to be an attractive alternative to conventional systems when considering life cycle environmental criteria. Internal combustion engine and microturbine (MT) cogeneration systems resulted in a reduction of up to 38% in global warming potential compared with conventional systems, while solid oxide fuel cell and MT cogeneration systems resulted in a reduction of up to 94% in tropospheric ozone precursor potential (TOPP). Results include a Pareto-optimal frontier between reducing costs and reducing the selected environmental indicators.","Buildings; Cogeneration; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Optimization; Tropospheric ozone precursors (TOPPs)","Buildings; Environmental impact; Mathematical models; Optimization; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Tropospheric ozone precursors (TOPP); Life cycle",,,,,,"(1997) Environment management-life cycle assessment: Principles and framework. 14040-1997, , ANSI/ISO, Ann Arbor, MI: NSF International; Burer, M., Tanaka, K., Favrat, D., Yamada, K., Multi-criteria optimization of a district cogeneration plant integrating a solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine combined cycle, heat pumps and chillers (2003) Energy, 28, pp. 497-518; Chung, W., Wu, J.Y., Fuller, J., Dynamic energy and environment equilibrium model for the assessment of CO2 emission control in Canada and the USA (1997) Energy economics, 19, pp. 103-124; Ellis, M.W., Gunes, M., Status of fuel cell systems for combined heat and power applications in buildings (2002) ASHRAE transactions, 108, pp. 1032-1044; (2004) Emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States 2004, p. 2005. , www.eia.doe.gov, EIA Energy Information Administration, online, Energy Information Administration Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC.
