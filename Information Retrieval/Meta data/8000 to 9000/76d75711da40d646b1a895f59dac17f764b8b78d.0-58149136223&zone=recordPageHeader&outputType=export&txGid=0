Cap-and-trade has been applied to various air pollutants including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the United States and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the European Union. This corresponds to what is likely to become the most expensive environmental undertaking in history -the effort to reduce the heating of the planet. However, the efficacy of a cap-and-trade policy for CO2 depends in large part on the design of the program. In addition to the level of the cap, the most important decision facing policymakers will be the initial allocation of emissions allowances. The method used to allocate tradable emissions allowances will have significant influence on the distributional impact and efficiency of the program. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc. and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Allocation; Auction; Cap-and-trade; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission allowances; Global warming; Grandfathering","atmospheric pollution; climate change; emissions trading; European Union; global warming; policy making; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound",,,,,,"Åhman, M., Holmgren, K., New entrant allocation in the Nordic energy sectors: Incentives and options in the EU ETS (2006) Climate Policy, 6, pp. 423-440; Åhman, M., Burtraw, D., Kruger, J., Zetterberg, L., A 10-year rule to guide the allocation of EU emission allowances (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 1718-1730; Beamon, J.A., Leckey, T., Martin, L., (2001) Power Plant Emission Reductions Using a Generation Performance Standard, , Draft.
