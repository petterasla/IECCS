(Latham et al. 2008 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 366) of a strategy to reduce insolation by exploiting the Twomey effect, the present paper describes in outline the rationale and underlying engineering hardware that may bring the strategy from concept to operation. Wind-driven spray vessels will sail back and forth perpendicular to the local prevailing wind and release micron-sized drops of seawater into the turbulent boundary layer beneath marine stratocumulus clouds. The combination of wind and vessel movements will treat a large area of sky. When residues left after drop evaporation reach cloud level they will provide many new cloud condensation nuclei giving more but smaller drops and so will increase the cloud albedo to reflect solar energy back out to space. If the possible power increase of 3.7W m-2 from double pre-industrial CO2 is divided by the 24-hour solar input of 340W m-2, a global albedo increase of only 1.1 per cent will produce a sufficient offset. The method is not intended to make new clouds. It will just make existing clouds whiter. This paper describes the design of 300 tonne ships powered by Flettner rotors rather than conventional sails. The vessels will drag turbines resembling oversized propellers through the water to provide the means for generating electrical energy. Some will be used for rotor spin, but most will be used to create spray by pumping 30kgs -1 of carefully filtered water through banks of filters and then to micro-nozzles with piezoelectric excitation to vary drop diameter. The rotors offer a convenient housing for spray nozzles with fan assistance to help initial dispersion. The ratio of solar energy reflected by a drop at the top of a cloud to the energy needed to make the surface area of the nucleus on which it has grown is many orders of magnitude and so the spray quantities needed to achieve sufficient global cooling are technically feasible. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Albedo control; Cloud condensation nuclei; Flettner rotor; Global warming; Spray generation; Twomey effect","Atmospheric aerosols; Clouds; Drops; Fluid mechanics; Global warming; Renewable energy resources; Seawater; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Technology; Turbulence; Wind power; Albedo control; Cloud albedo; Cloud condensation nuclei; Drop evaporation; Flettner rotor; Marine stratocumulus clouds; Power increase; Prevailing winds; Spray generation; Turbulent boundary layer; Twomey effect; Solar radiation; disaster; ecosystem; engineering; environmental protection; equipment; equipment design; greenhouse effect; instrumentation; methodology; review; sea; Conservation of Natural Resources; Disasters; Ecosystem; Engineering; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Greenhouse Effect; Oceans and Seas",,,,,,"Bennartz, R., Global assessment of marine boundary layer cloud droplet number concentration from satellite (2007) J.
