There is an urgent need for new sustainable energy to meet the fast growing demand for clean energy. Fusion is one of the few options which may be able to satisfy the requirement for large scale sustainable energy generation and global warming suppression and therefore must be developed as quickly as possible. Fusion research has been carried out for the past 50 years. It is too long to wait for another 50 years to generate electricity by fusion. A much more aggressive approach should be taken with international collaboration towards the early use of fusion energy to meet the urgent needs for energy and global warming suppression. © 2010 IAEA, Vienna.",,"Clean energy; Critical issues; Energy shortages; Environmental pollutions; Fusion energy; Fusion research; Generate electricity; Growing demand; Human being; International collaborations; Magnetic fusion; Sustainable energy; Global warming; International cooperation; Energy conservation",,,,,,"(2007) The Greenwald Report; (2008) Report of the EU Fusion Facilities Review Panel; (2007) UKAEA, , (revised/improved version of original table in UKAEA FUS 521, 2005); Wobig, H., (2003) Nucl.
