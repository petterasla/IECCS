That means a bamboo in its early ontogeny can absorb about 3.73 cubic meter of carbon dioxide, equivalent to absorbing about 2 cars"" CO2 emissions in a day. It is concluded that bamboo is an efficient candidate to control global warming. The observation is made in Lin-an City, Zhejiang province, China from April 13 to May 10, 2005.","Allometry; Bamboo (phyllostachys heterocycla var. pubescens); Carbon accumulation",,,,,,,"He, J.H., Shrinkage of body size of small insects: A possible link to global warming?
