Precipitation is often the limiting factor in crop production, and thus knowledge of precipitation variability is essential. The region is unique in currently having three sources of precipitation observations: (1) multi-sensor precipitation estimates from the National Weather Service (NWS) NEXRAD network; (2) surface observations from NWS recording stations; and (3) surface observations from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) recording stations. For meteorological and climatological precipitation research, quantitatively defining the biases associated with available precipitation data sources is critical in selecting which source to use for a given application. Results of this research indicate that the multi-sensor data are in best agreement with surface observations during the cool season (October-March) when stratiform precipitation dominates, whereas only moderate correlations exist during the warm season. Additionally, overall bias values among the data sources decrease after 2002, at which point the remotely sensed and surface-based estimates show improved agreement.","Mississippi Delta; National Weather Service; NEXRAD; Precipitation data; SCAN","alluvial plain; climate prediction; correlation; estimation method; precipitation (climatology); remote sensing; sampling bias; satellite data; weather forecasting; Louisiana; Mississippi Delta; North America; United States",,,,,,"Adams, R.M., Rosenzweig, C., Peart, R.M., Ritchie, J.T., McCarl, B.A., Glyer, J.D., Curry, R.B., Allen Jr., L.H., Global climate change and U.S. agriculture (1990) Nature, 345; Adams, R.M., Fleming, R.A., Chang, C.-C., McCarl, B.A., Rosenzweig, C., A reassessment of the economic effects of global climate change on U.S. agriculture (1995) Climatic Change, 30; Austin, P., Relation between measured radar reflectivity and surface rainfall (1987) Monthly Weather Review, 115; Briedenbach, J., Seo, D.J., Fulton, R., Stage II and III post processing of NEXRAD precipitation estimates in the modernized Weather Service (1998) 14th International Conference on Interactive Information and Processing Systems for Meteorology, Oceanography, and Hydrology, , Preprints, Phoenix, Arizona; Ciach, G.J., Local random errors in tipping-bucket rain gauge measurements (2003) Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 20; (2005) Delta Council Annual Report 2005, , http://www.deltacouncil.org/Reports/Ann_AnnualReport2005.pdf, Delta Council.
