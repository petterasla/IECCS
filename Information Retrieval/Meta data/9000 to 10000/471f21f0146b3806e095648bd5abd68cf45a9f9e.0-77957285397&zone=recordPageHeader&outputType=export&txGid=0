When intermittency occurs in river ecosystems, hydrologic connectivity is interrupted and this affects benthic, hyporheic and flowing water compartments. Organic matter use and transport can be particularly affected during the transition from wet to dry and dry to wet conditions. In order to characterize the changes in benthic organic matter quantity and quality throughout a drying and rewetting process, organic matter, and enzyme activities were analyzed in the benthic accumulated material (biofilms growing on rocks and cobbles, leaves, and sand) and in flowing water (dissolved and particulate fractions). The total polysaccharide, amino acid, and lipid content in the benthic organic matter were on average higher in the drying period than in the rewetting period. However, during the drying period, peptide availability decreased, as indicated by decreases in leucine aminopeptidase activity, as well as amino acid content in the water and benthic material, except leaves; while polysaccharides were actively used, as indicated by an increase in β-glucosidase activity in the benthic substrata and an increase in polysaccharide content of the particulate water fraction and in leaf material. During this process, microbial heterotrophs were constrained to use the organic matter source of the lowest quality (polysaccharides, providing only C), since peptides (providing N and C) were no longer available. During the flow recovery phase, the microbial community rapidly recovered, suggesting the use of refuges and/or adaptation to desiccation during the previous drought period. The scouring during rewetting was responsible for the mobilization of the streambed and loss of benthic material, and the increase in high quality organic matter in transport (at that moment, polysaccharides and amino acids accounted for 30% of the total DOC). The dynamics of progressive and gradual drought effects, as well as the fast recovery after rewetting, might be affected by the interaction of the individual dynamics of each benthic substratum: sand sediments and leaves providing refuge for microorganisms and organic matter storage, while on cobbles, an active bacterial community is developed in the rewetting. Since global climate change may favor a higher intensity and frequency of droughts in streams, understanding the effects of these disturbances on the materials and biota could contribute to reliable resource management. The maintenance of benthic substrata heterogeneity within the stream may be important for stream recovery after droughts. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Amino acids; Benthic substrata; Drought; Extracellular enzyme activities; Lipids; Mediterranean stream; Organic matter; Polysaccharides","Acid content; Bacterial community; Benthic substrata; Drought periods; Extracellular enzyme activity; Fast recovery; Flowing waters; Global climate changes; Glucosidase activity; Heterotrophs; High quality; Hydrologic connectivity; Hyporheic; Intermittency; Leucine aminopeptidase; Lipid content; Mediterranean streams; Microbial communities; Organic matter; Organic matter source; Particulate fraction; Polysaccharide contents; Re-wetting; Recovery phase; Resource management; River ecosystem; Stream recovery; Streambeds; Water flows; Water fraction; Wet conditions; Amino acids; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Drought; Drying; Ecosystems; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Flow of water; Hydraulics; Lipids; Organic acids; Peptides; Polysaccharides; Recovery; Sediments; Water content; Water resources; Rivers; amino acid; drought; enzyme activity; freshwater ecosystem; lipid; Mediterranean environment; microbial community; organic matter; polysaccharide; substrate; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,,,,,"Acuña, V., Muñoz, I., Giorgi, A., Omella, M., Sabater, F., Sabater, S., Drought and postdrought recovery cycles in an intermittent Mediterranean stream: structural and functional aspects (2005) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 24, pp. 919-933; Acuña, V., Giorgi, A., Munoz, I., Sabater, F., Sabater, S., Meteorological and riparian influences on organic matter dynamics in a forested Mediterranean stream (2007) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 26, pp. 54-69; Amalfitano, S., Fazi, S., Zoppini, A.M., Caracciolo, A.B., Grenni, P., Puddu, A., Responses of benthic bacteria to experimental drying in sediments from Mediterranean temporary rivers (2008) Microbial Ecology, 55, pp. 270-279; Arnell, R., Bates, B., Land, H., Magnusson, J.J., Mulholland, P., Hydrology and freshwater ecology (1996) Climate Change 1995: Impacts, Adaptations, and Mitigation, pp. 325-364. , R.
