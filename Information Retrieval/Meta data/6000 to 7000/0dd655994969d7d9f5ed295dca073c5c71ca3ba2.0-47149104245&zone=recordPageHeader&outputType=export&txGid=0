Acclimatization is a primary mechanism by which organisms match their physiology in a timely and beneficial way to a rapidly changing environment, and so it is not surprising that the question 'can corals acclimatize to GCC effects?' is a central theme in coral reef science today. Here, we argue that acclimatization in corals, as in all organisms, is axiomatic - i.e. evident without proof or argument - and that the emphasis on whether corals can acclimatize to GCC is distracting. The key to understanding how corals will respond to future environmental challenges lies in understanding the extent to which acclimatization is important. This is a subject that has received great attention in other systems, and we think that coral biologists can benefit from a deeper understanding of the classical physiological expression of acclimatization, and a broader appreciation of the experimental designs that are required for elucidating the complex relationships among physiology, physical conditions, and recent history. © Inter-Research 2008.","Acclimatization; Climate change; Coral; Scleractinia","acclimation; climate change; coral reef; environmental change; environmental stress; experimental design; physiological response; survival; tropical environment; Anthozoa; Scleractinia",,,,,,"Apprill, A.M., Gates, R.D., Recognizing diversity in coral symbiotic dinoflagellate communities (2007) Mol Ecol, 16, pp. 1127-1134; Bellwood, D.R., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Nystrom, M., Confronting the coral reef crisis (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 827-833; Blank, R.J., Trench, R.K., Speciation and symbiotic dinoflagellates (1985) Science, 229, pp. 656-658; Brown, B.E., Dunne, R.P., Goodson, M.S., Douglas, A.E., Experience shapes the susceptibility of a reef coral to bleaching (2002) Coral Reefs, 21, pp. 119-126; Bruno, J.F., Selig, E.R., Regional decline of coral cover in the Indo-Pacific: Timing, extent, and subregional comparisons (2007) PLoS One, 8, pp. 1-8; Buddemeier, R.W., Smith, S.V., Coral adaptation and acclimatization: A most ingenious paradox (1999) Am Zool, 39, pp. 1-9; Buddemeier, R.W., Kleypas, J.A., Aronson, R.B., (2004) Coral reefs and global climate change, , Pew Center on Global Climate Change, Arlington, VA; Coles, S.L., Jokiel, P.L., Synergistic effects of temperature, salinity and light on the hermatypic coral Montipora verrucosa (1978) Mar Biol, 49, pp. 187-195; Falkowski, P.G., Dubinsky, Z., Light-shade adaptation of Stylophora pistillata, a hermatypic coral from the Gulf of Eilat (1981) Nature, 289, pp. 172-174; Foster, A.B., Phenotypic plasticity in the reef corals Montastraea annularia (Ellis & Solander) and Siderastrea siderea (Ellis & Solander) (1979) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 39, pp. 25-54; Gardner, T.A., Cote, I.M., Gill, J.A., Grant, A., Watkinson, A.R., Long-term, region-wide declines in Caribbean corals (2003) Science, 301, pp. 958-960; Gates, R.D., Edmunds, P.J., The physiological mechanisms of acclimatization in tropical reef corals (1999) Am Zool, 39, pp. 30-43; Gould, S.J., Lewontin, R.C., The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: A critique of the adaptationist programme (1979) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 205, pp. 581-598; Gould, S.J., Lloyd, E.A., Individuality and adaptation across levels of selection: How shall we name and generalize the unit of Darwinism?
