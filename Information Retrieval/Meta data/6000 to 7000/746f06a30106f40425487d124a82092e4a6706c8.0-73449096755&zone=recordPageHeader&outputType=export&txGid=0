I report an observation of a Raccoon that supports claims that this species has expanded its range well into the boreal forest of northeastern Alberta. Agriculture, industrial activity, and global warming may be important factors in facUitating Raccoon range expansion in the boreal regions of Alberta and Saskatchewan.","Agriculture; Distribution; Northern Alberta; Procyon lotor; Raccoon; Range extension","agricultural land; boreal forest; geographical distribution; global warming; human activity; mammal; range expansion; zoogeography; Alberta; Canada; Procyon; Procyon lotor",,,,,,"Gehrt, S.D., Raccoons and allies (2003) Wild Mammals of North America: Biology, Management, and Economics., pp. 611-634i. , Edited by G.
