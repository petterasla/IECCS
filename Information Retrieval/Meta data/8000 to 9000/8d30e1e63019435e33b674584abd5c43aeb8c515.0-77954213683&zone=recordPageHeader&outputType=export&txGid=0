In June 2009, a desert locust swarm invaded the Guassa Plateau, Ethiopia, a large and unusually intact Afroalpine tall-grass ecosystem, home to important populations of geladas (Theropithecus gelada), Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis), thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), and other Ethiopian or Horn of Africa endemics. During the outbreak and its aftermath, we observed many animals, including geladas, ravens, and a wolf, feeding on locusts in large quantities. These observations suggest surprising flexibility in the normally highly specialized diets of geladas and wolves, including the potential for temporary but intensive insectivory during locust outbreaks. To our knowledge, Guassa is the highest elevation site (3,200-3,600 m) at which desert locusts, which require temperatures >20°C for sustained flight, have been reported. Continued monitoring will be necessary to determine whether the June 2009 outbreak was an isolated incident or part of an emerging pattern in the Ethiopian Highlands linked to global warming. The intensive consumption of desert locusts by geladas, wolves, and ravens during the outbreak at Guassa raises concerns about pesticide-based locust control strategies and potential unintended adverse effects on endemic and endangered wildlife. © 2010 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.","Desert locust; Diet; Ethiopian wolf; Gelada; Global warming; Guassa; Locust control; Pesticide; Thick-billed raven","dietary shift; endangered species; endemic species; feeding behavior; global warming; insectivory; nature conservation; pest outbreak; primate; social behavior; wildlife management; animal; article; feeding behavior; grasshopper; physiology; population dynamics; Theropithecus; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Grasshoppers; Population Dynamics; Theropithecus; Ethiopia; Horn of Africa; Animalia; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Canis simensis; Corvus crassirostris; Orthoptera; Schistocerca gregaria; Theropithecus; Theropithecus gelada",,,,,,"Ashall, C., Ellis, P.E., Studies on numbers and mortality in field populations of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria Forskål) (1962) Anti-Locust Bull, 38, pp. 1-59; Ashenafi, Z.T., Coulson, T., Sillero-Zubiri, C., Leader-Williams, N., Behaviour and ecology of the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) in a human-dominated landscape outside protected areas (2005) Anim Conserv, 8, pp. 113-121; Beehner, J.C., Berhanu, G., Bergman, T.J., McCann, C., Population estimate for geladas (Theropithecus gelada) living in and around the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia (2008) Sinet, 30, pp. 149-154; Buhl, J., Sumpter, D.J.T., Couzin, I.D., Hale, J.J., Despland, E., Miller, E.R., Simpson, S.J., From disorder to order in marching locusts (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1402-1406; Crook, J.H., Aldrich-Blake, P., Ecological and behavioural contrasts between sympatric ground dwelling primates in Ethiopia (1968) Folia Primatol, 8, pp. 192-227; Dunbar, R.I.M., Feeding ecology of gelada baboons: A preliminary report (1977) Primate Ecology, pp. 251-273. , T.
