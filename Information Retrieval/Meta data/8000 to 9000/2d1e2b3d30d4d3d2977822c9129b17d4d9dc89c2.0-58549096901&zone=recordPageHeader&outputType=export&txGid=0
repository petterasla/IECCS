In this paper, a stand-alone MODAWEC model was developed to generate daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature from monthly precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and wet days. A case study shows that the crop yields and evapotranspiration (ET) simulated with the generated daily weather data compare very well with those simulated with the measured daily weather data with low normalized mean square errors (0.008-0.017 for crop yields and 0.003-0.004 for ET). The MODAWEC model can extend the application of the EPIC model to the regions where daily data are not available or not complete. In addition, the generated daily weather data can possibly be used by other environmental models. Associated with MODAWEC, the EPIC model can play a greater role in assessing the impacts of global climate change on future food production and water use. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Crop yield; Daily weather generator; Evapotranspiration","Agriculture; Climate change; Climatology; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Case studies; Crop yield; Daily weather generator; EPIC models; Food productions; Square errors; Water supply; climate change; crop yield; environmental modeling; evapotranspiration; food production; global climate; weather",,,,,,"Bannayan, M., Hoogenboom, G., Weather analogue: a tool for real-time prediction of daily weather data realizations based on a modified k-nearest neighbor approach (2008) Environmental Modelling and Software, 23 (6), p. 703; Bernardo, D.J., Economic and environmental impacts of water quality protection policies 1.
