The organic constituents and distributions of molecular tracers emitted from burning smoke of six natural vegetations including monsoon evergreen broad-leaf trees and shrubs in South China were determined in this study. The gas and particle samples were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major organic components in these smoke samples are methoxyphenols from lignin and saccharides from cellulose. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also present as minor constituents. Furanose, pyranose and their dianhydrides are the first reported in the biomass burning smoke. Some unique biomarkers were detected in this study which may be useful as specific tracers. The corresponding tracer/OC ratios are used as indicators for the two types of biomass burning. U/R (1.06-1.72) in the smoke samples may be used as parameters to distinguish broad-leaf trees and shrubs from fossil fuel. Other useful diagnostic ratios such as methylphenanthrene to phenanthrene (MPhe/Phe), phenanthrene to phenanthrene plus anthracene (Phe/(Phe + Ant)) and fluoranthene to fluoranthene plus pyrene (Flu/(Flu + Pyr)) and octadecenoic acid/OC are also identified in this study. These results are useful in efforts to better understand the emission characterization of biomass burning in South China and the contribution of regional biomass burning to global climate change. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
