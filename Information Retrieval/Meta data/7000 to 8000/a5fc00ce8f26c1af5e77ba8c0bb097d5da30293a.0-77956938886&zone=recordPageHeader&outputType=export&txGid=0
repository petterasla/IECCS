Some responses are considered reliable in as much as the simulated responses show consistency within ensembles and across models. Other responses-particularly at regional levels and for certain parameters such as precipitation-show little intermodel consistency even in the sign of the projected climate changes. The authors' results show that in these regions the consistency in the sign of projected precipitation variations is greater for intramodel runs (e.g., runs from the same model) than intermodel runs (e.g., runs from different models), indicating that knowledge of the internal ""dynamics"" of the climate system can provide additional skill in making projections of climate change. Given the consistency provided by the governing dynamics of the model, the authors test whether persistence from an.","Anthropogenic forcing; Climate models; Regional climate change","Anthropogenic forcing; Chemical constituents; Climate change impact; Global climate changes; Multiple integrations; Precipitation trends; Precipitation variation; Regional climate changes; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Climate change",,,,,,"Allan, R.P., Soden, B.J., Large discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation trends in the ascending and descending branches of the tropical circulation (2007) Geophysical Research Letters, 34 (18), pp. L18705. , DOI 10.1029/2007GL031460; Allen, M.R., Ingram, W.J., Constraints on future changes in climate and the hydrologic cycle (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 224-232; Barnett, T.P., Human-induced changes in the hydrology of the western United States (2008) Science, 319, pp. 1080-1083; Bhend, J., Von Storch, H., Consistency of observed winter precipitation trends in northern Europe with regional climate change projections (2008) Climate Dyn., 31, pp. 17-28; Covey, C., Achutarao, K.M., Cubasch, U., Jones, P., Lambert, S.J., Mann, M.E., Phillips, T.J., Taylor, K.E., An overview of results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (2003) Global Planet.
