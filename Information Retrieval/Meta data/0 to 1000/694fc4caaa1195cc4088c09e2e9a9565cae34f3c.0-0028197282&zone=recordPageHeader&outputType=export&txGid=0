M4V 1W1, Canada","The topic of vegetarian nutrition can be approached from several angles, perhaps one of the most important being the impact that meat production is having on the underdeveloped world, where ancient rain forests are being cleared to provide land for cattle grazing. Debt-burdened countries are turning over agricultural land to raise cattle and grains for feeding the cattle. These practices have resulted in less available land for the production of food, global warming because of the practices used for deforestation, exhaustion of the world's water supply, and other adverse effects on the health of the world. The consumption of meat for food is taking a toll on the consumer and the health of the world's poorest people. It is also contributing to an expanding need for foreign aid and growing world hunger.",,"agriculture; breast feeding; child nutrition; conference paper; developing country; ecosystem; environmental factor; european union; food intake; greenhouse effect; health care system; health education; human; hunger; meat; nutritional health; poverty; united nations; vegetarian diet; Child; Developing Countries; Diet; Diet, Vegetarian; Environment; Food Supply; Human; International Cooperation; Meat; Nutrition; Poverty",,,,,,,"Lewis, S.; Stephen Lewis Associates, 6 Montclair Avenue, Toronto, Ont.
