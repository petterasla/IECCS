This paper summarized its jeopardizing humanity, as well as the relevant stratagems declared by Unite Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Anthropogenic emission of carbon was greatly playing an important role since industrial revolution, when the steam engine was invented by watt about 150 year ago. Once ecological material science has been neglected, the research progress on atmosphere science became slow. The paper aimed at the burning spent gases and calcium carbonate nanoparticles can be successfully synthesized by wet-chemical segregate decarbonization technique (WCSDT), while another environmentally conscious materials- oxynitride ceramics (Sialon etc.) were fabricated from the recycling nitrogen. The overalls utilization of spent gas to gain a good economics including a removal of carbon dioxide might be achieved. It supplies a novel process for challenging the most difficult problem in the world. Meanwhile some prospects for this study have been put forward in advance.","Ecological material; Global warming; Nanometer calcium carbonate; Oxynitride ceramics",,,,,,,,"Xu, L.; Department of Inorganic Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China",,,,,,,,1002185X,,XJCGE,,"Chinese","Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845294419
