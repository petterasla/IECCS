However, limits to our present understanding of some of these processes is an important factor in our inability to model climate change precisely. Present knowledge of ocean structure and circulation is reviewed, with a particular emphasis on the Southern Hemisphere oceans, and the major ocean-atmosphere exchanges are examined. The influence of interhemispheric asymmetries in global warming scenarios is discussed. An improved understanding of the oceans and therefore better climate models will result from planned international ocean research experiments in the 1990s. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,,,,,,"Broeker, W.S., Peng, T.H., (1982) Tracers in the Ocean, , Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, New York; Bryan, K., Manabe, S., Spelman, M.J., Interhemispheric Asymmetry in the Transient Response of a Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Model to a CO<inf>2</inf> Forcing (1988) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 18 (6), pp. 851-867; Hamon, B.V., Godfrey, J.S., The Role of the Oceans (1978) Climate Change and Variability.
