But how do we actually achieve the goals of sustainability, and what actions can we take? Green Chemistry and Engineering technologies are providing innovative solutions for today and tomorrow in many areas of product and process research and application. These technologies are helping to address some of the world's most pressing environmental issues, which include global climate change, sustainable energy production, food production and the associated agricultural practices, depletion of nonrenewable resources, and the dissipation of toxic and hazardous materials in the environment. We describe the essential nature of Green Chemistry and Engineering in meeting these challenges and describe the specific examples and case studies that are presented in this book.",,,,,,,,"(1999) The World at Six Billion, , (ESA/P/WP. 154); United Nations: New York, October 12; (2001) OECD Environmental Outlook, , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: Paris; Loh, J., (2000) Living Planet Report 2000, , WWF-World Wide Fund For Nature: Gland, Switzerland, October; Rees, W., Wackernagel, M., Ecological Footprints and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: Measuring the Natural Capital Requirements of the Human Economy (1994) Investing in Natural Capital: The Ecological Economics Approach to Sustainability, pp. 362-390. , Jansson, A.-M., Hammer, M., Folke, C., Costanza R., Eds.; Washington, DC: Island Press; Mckibben, B., A Special Moment in History (1998) The Atlantic Monthly, 281 (5), pp. 55-78. , May; Anastas, P.T., Warner, J.C., (1998) Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice, , Oxford University Press: New York; Anastas, P.T., Heine, L.G., Williamson, T.C., (2000) Green Chemical Syntheses and Processes, , ACS Symposium Series 767; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC; Anastas, P.T., Heine, L.G., Williamson, T.C., (2001) Green Engineering, , ACS Symposium Series 766; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC","Anastas, P.T.; White Hse.
