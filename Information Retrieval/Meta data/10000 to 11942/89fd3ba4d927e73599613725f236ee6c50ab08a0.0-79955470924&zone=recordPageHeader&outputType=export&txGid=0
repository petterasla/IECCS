Using the solar irrigation systems is an effective way for sustaining pasture lands in arid regions. A solar irrigation system is the device that uses the solar cell from the sun's radiation to generate electricity for driving the pump. And photovoltaic pump consists of an array of photovoltaic cells and pumps water from a well or reservoir for irrigation. Although ecologists and organizations constantly work and find ways to conserve grasslands through irrigation systems that use solar energy, issues on water resources are not yet thoroughly discussed. This paper takes into account the main factors in the study of water resources, including precipitation and groundwater, to analyze the feasibility of using a photovoltaic (PV) pumping irrigation. The appropriate area for such a PV pumping irrigation in Qinghai Province is also presented. The results show that the grasslands appropriate for PV pumping cover about 8.145. million. ha, accounting for 22.3% of the grasslands in the entire province. Finally, the problems and countermeasures of PV pumping irrigation, including the impact on regional water balance, groundwater level and highland permafrost, are also considered. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Grassland; Photovoltaic pumping; Qinghai Province; Solar irrigation system","China; Grassland; Photovoltaic pumping; Qinghai Province; Solar irrigation system; Arid regions; Climate change; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Pumps; Reservoirs (water); Solar energy; Solar power generation; arid region; electricity generation; environmental impact; feasibility study; global change; human activity; irrigation system; pasture; permafrost; photovoltaic system; pumping; solar power; solar radiation; water level; water resource; China; Qinghai",,,,,,"Moussi, A., Saadi, A., Betka, A., Asher, M., Photovoltaic pumping systems technologies trends (2003) Larhyss J, 2, pp. 127-150; Lawrence, E., (1980), Solar materials sciences, Burlington;Tomas, M., (1997), Solar electricity.
