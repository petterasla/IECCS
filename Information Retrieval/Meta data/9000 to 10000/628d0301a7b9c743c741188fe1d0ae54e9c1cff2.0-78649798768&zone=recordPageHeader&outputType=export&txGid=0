In contrast to this growing recognition of a dynamic climate system, few studies have investigated geographic variations in postglacial climate changes, which may have been as dynamic as the temporal variations. Because temperature and ocean circulation are important controls on the biogeography of marine invertebrates, many Permian taxa were characteristic of either paleotropical or high-latitude faunal realms. This study takes advantage of that temperature sensitivity, using a database of more than 5000 Permian fossil collections from northwestern Pangea to reconstruct spatial variations in Permian climate changes throughout the region. Cluster analysis demonstrates that localities in the Phosphoria basin (Nevada/Idaho/Wyoming) were taxonomically distinct from coeval faunas in Texas and occupied the transitional zone between Paleoequatorial and Boreal realms. Quantitative scoring of the faunal affinity of all taxa in 1 by 1° paleolatitudinal bins suggests that the western margin of Laurentia was affected by a persistent southward-flowing cool boundary current, and that the effects of the current became more pronounced throughout the Permian in conjunction with cooling in the Boreal ocean. The increasingly cool-water nature of Phosphoria basin faunas contrasted with warming in Texas and implies that northern and northwest Pangea were decoupled from the broader global warming trend following the late Paleozoic ice age. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeography; Late Paleozoic ice age; Paleoclimate; Permian; Phosphoria basin","climate change; cooling; database; deglaciation; faunistics; fossil record; geographical variation; glacial-interglacial cycle; invertebrate; oceanic circulation; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; paleogeography; paleontology; Permian; Pleistocene; Invertebrata",,,,,,"Beauchamp, B., Baud, A., Growth and demise of Permian biogenic chert along northwest Pangea: evidence for end-Permian collapse of thermohaline circulation (2002) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 184, pp. 37-63; Belasky, P., Stevens, C.H., Hanger, R.A., Early Permian location of western North American terranes based on brachiopod, fusulinid, and coral biogeography (2002) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 179, pp. 245-266; Biakov, A.S., New ideas on the system of the Permian Inoceramus-like bivalves of the eastern Boreal zone (2008) Paleontological Journal, 47, pp. 232-242; Butler, R.F., Gehrels, G.E., Bazard, D.R., Paleomagnetism of Paleozoic strata of the Alexander terrane, southeastern Alaska (1997) GSA Bulletin, 109, pp. 1372-1388; Ciriacks, K.W., Permian and Eotriassic bivalves of the middle Rockies (1963) Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, 125, pp. 1-100; Coogan, A.H., Stratigraphy and paleontology of the Permian Nosoni and Dekkas Formations (Bollibokka Group) (1960) University of California Publications in Geological Sciences, 36, pp. 243-316; Cooper, G.A., Grant, R.E., Permian brachiopods of west Texas, III (1975) Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, 19, pp. 795-1920; Cooper, G.A., Grant, R.E., Permian brachiopods of west Texas, V (1976) Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, 24, pp. 2609-3159; Cooper, G.A., Dunbar, C.O., Duncan, H., Miller, A.K., Knight, J.B., Permian fauna at El Antimonio, western Sonora, Mexico (1953) Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 119 (2), pp. 1-111; dos Santos, P.R., Rocha-Campos, A.C., Canuto, J.R., Patterns of late Paleozoic deglaciation in the Paraná Basin, Brazil (1996) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 125, pp. 165-184; Fedorowski, J., Bamber, E.W., Stevens, C.H., Lower Permian colonial rugose corals, western and northwestern Pangaea: taxonomy and distribution (2007) National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, p. 231; Fielding, C.R., The stratigraphic imprint of the late Paleozoic ice age in eastern Austraia: a record of alternating glacial and non-glacial intervals (2008) Journal of the Geological Society, London, 165, pp. 129-140; Finks, R.M., Conularia in a sponge from the west Texas Permian (1955) Journal of Paleontology, 29, pp. 831-836; Gibbs, M.T., Simulations of Permian climate and comparisons with climate-sensitive sediments (2002) Journal of Geology, 110, pp. 33-55; Gilmour, E.H., Morozova, I.P., Biogeography of the late Permian bryozoans (1999) Paleontological Journal, 33, pp. 36-51; Gilmour, E.H., Snyder, E.M., Bryozoa of the Mission Argillite (Permian), northeastern Washington (2000) Journal of Paleontology, 74, pp. 545-570; Gilmour, E.H., Walker, R.C., Bryozoans from the Phosphoria Formation (Permian), southeastern Idaho (1986) Contributions to Geology, University of Wyoming, 24, pp. 191-209; Gilmour, E.H., McColloch, M.E., Wardlaw, B.R., Bryozoa of the Murdock Mountain Formation (Wordian, Permian), Leach Mountains, northeastern Nevada (1997) Journal of Paleontology, 71, pp. 214-236; Girty, G.H., The fauna of the phosphate beds of the Park City Formation (1910) United States Geological Survey Bulletin, 436, pp. 1-82; Grant, R.E., Taxonomy and autecology of two arctic Permian rhynchonellid brachiopods (1971) Paleozoic Perspectives: A Paleontological Tribute to G.
