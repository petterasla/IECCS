Here, we show that species richness of fish in the North Sea, a group of ecological and socio-economical importance, has increased over a 22-year period and that this rise is related to higher water temperatures. Over eight times more fish species displayed increased distribution ranges in the North Sea (mainly small-sized species of southerly origin) compared with those whose range decreased (primarily large and northerly species). This increase in species richness can be explained from the fact that fish species richness in general decreases with latitude. This observation confirms that the interaction between large-scale biogeographical patterns and climate change may lead to increasing species richness at temperate latitudes. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity; Biogeography; Climate change; Extinction; Fisheries; Global warming; NorthSea; speciesrichness","biodiversity; biogeography; climate change; extinction; fish; geographical distribution; global warming; range expansion; species richness; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Pisces",,,,,,"Attrill, M.J., (1998) A Rehabilitated Estuarine Ecosystem: The Environment and Ecology of the Thames Estuary, , Kluwer Academic Publishers Dordrecht; Attrill, M.J., Power, A.J., Climatic influence on a marine fish assemblage (2002) Nature, 417, pp. 275-278; Beare, D.J., Burns, F., Greig, A., Long-term increases in prevalence of North Sea fishes having southern biogeographic affinities (2004) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 284, pp. 269-278; Beaugrand, G., Reid, P.C., Long-term changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton and salmon related to climate (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 1-17; Clarke, A., Gaston, K.J., Climate, energy and diversity (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 2257-2266; Cushing, D.H., Dickson, R.R., The biological response in the sea to climatic changes (1976) Advances in Marine Biology, 14, pp. 1-122; Daan, N., (2001) The IBTS Database: A Plea for Quality Control.
