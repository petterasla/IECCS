Part of this carbon is ultimately released to the atmosphere, but the long timescale of regional metamorphism implies that the short-term effects on the environment are minor. However, contact metamorphism around igneous sill intrusions in organic-rich sedimentary basins has the potential to generate huge volumes of CH4 and CO2, and these gases are rapidly released to the atmosphere through vertical pipe structures. The high flux and volume of greenhouse gases produced in this way suggest that contact metamorphic processes could have a first-order influence on global warming and mass extinctions.","Contact metamorphism; Large igneous provinces; Metamorphic carbon degassing; Rapid environmental changes; Volcanic basins","carbon dioxide; degassing; global warming; greenhouse gas; heat flow; mass extinction; metamorphic rock; orogenic belt; pipe; sedimentary basin; sill; timescale; volume; Calluna vulgaris",,,,,,"Becker, J.A., Bickle, M.J., Galy, A., Holland, T.J.B., Himalayan metamorphic CO2 fluxes: Quantitative constraints from hydrothermal springs (2008) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 265, pp. 616-629; Beerling, D.J., Harfoot, M., Lomax, B., Pyle, J.A., The stability of the stratospheric ozone layer during the end-Permian eruption of the Siberian Traps (2007) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 365, pp. 1843-1866; Cohen, A.S., Coe, A.L., Kemp, D.B., The late Palaeocene-Early Eocene and Toarcian (Early Jurassic) carbon isotope excursions: A comparison of their time scales, associated environmental changes, causes and consequences (2007) Journal of the Geological Society, 164, pp. 1093-1108; Courtillot, V.E., Renne, P.R., On the ages of flood basalt events (2003) Comptes Rendus Geoscience, 335, pp. 113-140; Dickens, G.R., Castillo, M.M., Walker, J.C.G., A blast of gas in the latest Paleocene: Simulating first-order effects of massive dissociation on oceanic methane hydrate (1997) Geology, 25, pp. 259-262; Evans, M.J., Derry, L.A., France-Lanord, C., Degassing of metamorphic carbon dioxide from the Nepal Himalaya (2008) Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, 9, pp. Q04021. , doi:10.1029/2007GC001796; Ganino, C., Arndt, N.T., Climate changes caused by degassing of sediments during the emplacement of large igneous provinces (2009) Geology, 37, pp. 323-326; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , IPCC Working Group I, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Geneva.
