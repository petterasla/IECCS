I used a series of large-scale transplant experiments to investigate the mechanisms controlling species abundance near a poleward range boundary. The intertidal limpet Collisella scabra experiences a 100-fold decline in abundance over the northernmost 300 km of its range. Temperature and food supply both strongly influenced individual survival, growth, and maturation. Regression analysis also revealed significant interactions among these conditions: the effect of one could not be predicted without knowing the level of the other. But these relationships could not explain geographic abundance patterns. Instead, individual limpets were highly successful at sites with relatively low abundance. These results suggest that, even though temperature is important to the success of individual C. scabra populations, the primary effect of warming temperatures under climate change may not be a shift in geographic distribution. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Collisella scabra; Geographic range limit; Intertidal; Macclintockia; Temperature","abundance; boundary; food supply; mollusc; temperature effect; alga; animal; article; cold climate; gastropod; geography; Pacific Ocean; physiology; temperature; United States; Algae; Animals; California; Cold Climate; Gastropoda; Geography; Oregon; Pacific Ocean; Temperature; Collisella scabra; Patellidae",,,,,,"Bakun, A., Global climate change and intensification of coastal ocean upwelling (1990) Science, 247, pp. 198-201; Barry, J.P., Baxter, C.H., Sagarin, R.D., Gilman, S.E., Climate-related, long-term faunal changes in a California rocky intertidal community (1995) Science, 267, pp. 672-675; Bowman, R.S., Lewis, J.R., Geographical variation in the breeding cycles and recruitment of Patella species (1986) Hydrobiologia, 142, pp. 41-56; Branch, G.M., The biology of limpets: Physical factors, energy flow, and ecological interactions (1981) Oceanogr Mar Biol Annu Rev, 19, pp. 235-380; Briggs, J.C., (1974) Marine Zoogeography, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Brown, J.H., On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species (1984) Am Nat, 124, pp. 255-279; Brown, J.H., Lomolino, M.V., (1998) Biogeography, 2nd Edn., , Sinauer, Sunderland, Mass; Brown, J.H., Stevens, G.C., Kaufman, D.M., The geographic range: Size, shape, boundaries and internal structure (1996) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 27, pp. 597-623; Canterbury, G., Metabolic adaptation and climatic constraints on winter bird distribution (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 946-957; Carter, R.N., Prince, S.D., Epidemic models used to explain bio geographical distribution limits (1981) Nature, 293, pp. 644-645; Caughley, G., Grice, D., Barker, R., Brown, B., The edge of the range (1988) J Anim Ecol, 57, pp. 771-786; Connell, J.H., The influence of interspecific competition and other factors on the distribution of the barnacle Chthamalus stellatus (1961) Ecology, 42, pp. 710-723; Cossins, A.R., Bowler, K., (1987) Temperature Biology of Animals, , Chapman and Hall, New York; Dahlhoff, E.P., Buckley, B.A., Menge, B.A., Physiology of the rocky intertidal predator Nucella ostrina along an environmental stress gradient (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 2816-2829; Davis, A.J., Jenkinson, L.S., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Wood, S., Making mistakes when predicting shifts in species range in response to global warming (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 783-786; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Snyder, M.A., Sloan, L.C., Could CO2-induced land-cover feedbacks alter near-shore upwelling regimes?
