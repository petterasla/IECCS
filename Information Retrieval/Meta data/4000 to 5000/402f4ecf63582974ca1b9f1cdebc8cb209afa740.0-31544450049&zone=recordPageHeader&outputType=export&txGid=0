The OTCs increased the daily mean air-temperature by 1.7°C throughout the growing season. For five alpine species - two deciduous shrubs: Arctous alpinus and Vaccinium uliginosum and three evergreen shrubs: Ledum palustre subsp. decumbens, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Empetrum nigrum var. japonicum - effects of artificial warming on reproductive components were investigated during five (for flower production) or four (for fruit production) years. In addition, seedling establishments were compared among the three vegetation types and bare ground. Flower production in the OTCs was enhanced significantly in both deciduous species over that of control plots. In contrast, comparison to the control plots showed a significant decrease in flower production in the OTCs in two of the evergreen species. Fruit production of V. uliginosum and L. palustre was enhanced in the OTCs relative to the control plots. Both deciduous species allocated their resources to reproduction rather than to vegetative growth. Seedling establishment was very rare and was restricted on bare ground in this study site. We concluded that the difficulty of seedling establishment gives advantage to some species, which show active vegetative growth under global warming, to develop their vegetation cover.","Allocation pattern; Artificial warming; Reproduction; Seedling establishment","Arctostaphylos alpina; Empetrum nigrum; Rhododendron; Rhododendron tomentosum; Vaccinium; Vaccinium uliginosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea",,,,,,"Arft, A.M., Walker, M.D., Gurevitch, J., Alatalo, J.M., Bret-Harte, M.S., Dale, M., Diemer, M., Wookey, P.A., Responses of tundra plants to experimental warming: Meta-analysis of the International tundra experiment (1999) Ecological Monographs, 69, pp. 491-511; Chapin III, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Individualistic growth response of tundra plant species to environmental manipulations in the field (1985) Ecology, 66, pp. 564-576; Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Laundre, J.A., Responses of arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Graglia, E., Jonasson, S., Michelsen, A., Schmidt, I.K., Havstöm, M., Gustavsson, L., Effects of environmental perturbations on abundance of subarctic plants after three, seven and ten years of treatments (2001) Ecography, 24, pp. 5-12; Henry, G.H.R., Freedman, B., Svoboda, J., Effects of fertilization on three tundra plant communities of a polar desert oasis (1986) Canadian Journal of Botany, 64, pp. 2502-2507; Hobbie, S., Chapin III, F.S., The response of tundra plant biomass, aboveground production, nitrogen, and CO2 flux to experimental warming (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1526-1544; Kudo, G., Suzuki, S., Relationships between flowering phenology and fruit-set of dwarf shrubs growing on alpine fellfields in northern Japan: A comparison with a subarctic heathland in northern Sweden (2002) Arctic, Anterctic, and Alpine Research, 34, pp. 185-190; Warming effects on growth, production, and vegetation structure of alpine shrubs: A five-year experiment in northern Japan (2003) Oecologia, 135, pp. 280-287; Marion, G.M., Henry, G.H.R., Freckman, D.W., Johnstone, J., Jones, G., Jones, M.H., Levesque, E., Virginia, R.A., Open-top designs for manipulating field temperature in high-latitude ecosystems (1997) Global Change Biology, 3 (1 SUPPL.), pp. 20-30; Maxwell, B., Arctic climate: Potential for change under global warming (1992) Arctic Ecosystems in a Changing Climate, pp. 11-34. , CHAPIN III F.
