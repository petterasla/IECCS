In the centuries that followed, the share of global cropland increased to 2% in ad 1700 (c. 3 million km2) and 11% in ad 2000 (15 million km2), while the share of pasture area grew from 2% in ad 1700 to 24% in ad 2000 (34 million km2) These profound land-use changes have had, and will continue to have, quite considerable consequences for global biogeochemical cycles, and subsequently global climate change.Main conclusions Some researchers suggest that humans have shifted from living in the Holocene (emergence of agriculture) into the Anthropocene (humans capable of changing the Earth's atmosphere) since the start of the Industrial Revolution. But in the light of the sheer size and magnitude of some historical land-use changes (e.g. as result of the depopulation of Europe due to the Black Death in the 14th century and the aftermath of the colonization of the Americas in the 16th century) we believe that this point might have occurred earlier in time. While there are still many uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge about the importance of land use (change) in the global biogeochemical cycle, we hope that this database can help global (climate) change modellers to close parts of this gap. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agricultural development; Cropland; DGVM; EMIC; ESM; Historical population; Human impact; IPCC; Land use; Pasture","agricultural development; anthropogenic effect; biogeochemistry; climate variation; database; demography; global change; Holocene; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; land use change; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; pasture; spatial analysis",,,,,,"Armesto, J.J., Manuschevich, D., Mora, A., Smith-Ramirez, C., Rozzi, R., Abarzúa, A.M., Marquet, P.A., From the Holocene to the Anthropocene: a historical framework for land cover change in southwestern South America in the past 15,000 years (2009) Land Use Policy, 24, pp. 148-160; Atlas of Australian resources: vegetation (1990), Australian Surveying and Land Information Group (AUSLIG) Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra, ACTBartholomé, E., Belward, A.S., Achard, F., Bartalev, S., Carmonamoreno, C., Eva, H., Fritz, S., Stibig, H., (2002), GLC 2000; global land cover mapping for the year 2000.
