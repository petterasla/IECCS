These recent model results appear to give more credence to the following aspects: weakened winter monsoon associated with the shallower and northeastward shifted planetary wave trough over the east coast of the Eurasian Continent and increased activity of east Asian monsoonal rain band in summer associated with the strengthening of anticyclonic cells to its south and north.
