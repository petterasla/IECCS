Six tundra biomes of increasing summer temperature requirements were defined based on regionally coherent pollen assemblages. Using a rule-based approach, pollen spectra were converted to tundra, forest/tundra, or forest biomes ranked by their average growing season requirements. Marine sea-surface reconstructions were based on proxy data following a similar rule-based approach. From these data-based reconstructions, departures in summer temperatures from modern normals were calculated in 1 ka time slices through the Holocene. To test predictive models, data-based summer temperature reconstructions were compared with general circulation model (GCM) simulations for 10 ka and 6 ka ago. Paleodata and model results both show that warming occurred earlier across Beringia and Asia relative to lands adjacent to the North Atlantic, and that Late Holocene cooling was most apparent in the North Atlantic region. However, the GCM over-predicts the magnitude of Mid-Holocene warming over northern Asia and underestimates the intensification of the North Atlantic drift in the early Holocene. Strong spatial variability in environmental response during the Holocene, despite symmetric (insolation) forcing, suggests that any future changes, whether caused by anthropogenic or natural factors, are unlikely to result in a uniform change across the Arctic, adding additional complexity to forecasts of global impacts. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Data reduction; Earth atmosphere; Forestry; Ocean structures; Spatial variables control; Paleoenvironmental records; Climate change; general circulation model; Holocene; model validation; paleoclimate; spatial variation; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean",,,,,,"Bartlein, P.J., Anderson, K.H., Paleoclimate simulations for North America over the past 21,000 years: Features of the simulated climate and comparisons with paleoenvironmental data (1998) Quaternary Science Reviews, 17, pp. 549-585; Bergengren, J.C., Thompson, S.L., Modeling the effects of global climate change on natural vegetation, Part 1: The equilibrium vegetation ecology model Global Planetary Change; Bonan, G.B., Chapin, F.S.I., Thompson, S.L., Boreal forest and tundra ecosystems as components of the climate system (1995) Climatic Change, 29, pp. 145-167; Carissmo, B.C., Oort, A.H., Vonder Haar, T.H., Estimating the meridional energy transports in the atmosphere and oceans (1985) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 15, pp. 82-91; Climate changes of the last 18,000 years: Observations and model simulations (1988) Science, 241, pp. 1043-1052; Dyke, A.S., Dale, J.E., McNeely, R.N., Morine Mollusces as indicators of environmental change in glaciated North America and Greenland during the last 18,000 years (1996) Géographie Physique et Quarternaire, 36, pp. 5-14; Elias, S.A., Short, S.K., Nelson, C.H., Birks, H.H., Life and times of the Bering land bridge (1996) Nature, 382, pp. 60-63; Fairbanks, R.G., A 17,000 year glacio-eustatic sea level record: Influence of glacial melting rates on the Younger Dryas event and deep-ocean circulation (1989) Nature, 342, pp. 637-642; Felzer, B.S., Thompson, S.L., Pollard, D., Bergengren, J.C., GCM-simulated hydrology in the Arctic during the past 21,000 years (2000) Journal of Paleolimnology, 24, pp. 15-28; Feyling-Hanssen, R.W., Jørgensen, J.A., Knudsen, K.-L., Andersen, A.-L.L., Late quaternary foraminifera from Vendsyssel, Denmark and Sandnes, Norway (1971) Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark, 21, pp. 61-317; Foley, J.A., Kutzbach, J.E., Coe, M.T., Levis, S., Climate and vegetation feedbacks during the mid-Holocene (1994) Nature, 371, pp. 52-54; Foley, J.A., Prentice, I.C., Romankutty, N., Levis, S., Pollard, D., Sitch, S., Haxeltine, A., An integrated biosphere model of land surface processes, terrestrial carbon balance, and vegetation dynamics (1996) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 10, pp. 603-628; Funder, S., Weidick, A., Holocene boreal molluscs in Greenland: Paleoceanographic implications (1991) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 85, pp. 123-135; Hald, M., Aspeli, R., Rapid climatic shifts of the northern Norwegian Sea during the last deglaciation and the Holocene (1997) Boreas, 26, pp. 15-28; Hastenrath, S., On meridional heat transports in the World Ocean (1982) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 12, pp. 922-927; Hicks, S., (1997) Holocene Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Environmental Change in the Arctic, , Abstracts Volume, Lammi, Finland, April; Jennings, A.E., Weiner, N.W., Environmental change in eastern Greenland during the last 1300 years: Evidence from foraminifera and lithofacies in Nansen Fjord, 68°N (1996) The Holocene, 6, pp. 179-191; Jolly, D., Harrison, S.P., Simulated climate and biomes of Africa during the Late Quaternary: Comparison with pollen and lake status data (1998) Quaternary Science Reviews, 17, pp. 629-657; Joussaume, S., Taylor, K., (1998) IGBP Report 45: PAGES Status Report and Implementation Plan, pp. 173-178. , F.
