This has led to serious concerns on energy security and global warming. To address these issues, numerous alternative energy carriers have been proposed. Among them, second generation biofuel is one of the most promising technologies. Gasification-based thermochemical conversion will bring flexibility to both feedstock and production sides of a plant, thus presents an attractive technical route to address both the energy security and global warming concerns. In this paper, thermochemical ethanol production using multiple-feedstock (corn stover, municipal solid waste, and wood chips) is simulated using Aspen Plus and compared with the single-feedstock scenario, in terms of economic performances, life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and survivability under extreme weather conditions. For a hypothetical facility in southwest Indiana it is found that multiple-feedstock strategy improves the net present value by 18% compared to single-feedstock strategy. This margin is increased to 57% when effects of extreme weather conditions on feedstock supply are considered. Moreover, multiple-feedstock fuel plant has no potential risk of bankruptcy during the payback period, while single-feedstock fuel plant has a 75% chance of bankruptcy. Although the multiple-feedstock strategy has 26% more GHG emission per liter of ethanol produced than the single-feedstock strategy, the trend is reversed if feedstock supply disruption is taken into account. Thus the idea of multiple-feedstock strategy is proposed to the future thermo chemical biofuel plants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel production; Economic performance; Extreme weather; GHG emission; Multiple-feedstock","Biofuel production; Economic performance; Extreme weather; GHG emission; Multiple-feedstock; Environmental management; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Investments; Meteorology; Petroleum transportation; Solid wastes; Wood products; Feedstocks; alternative energy; biofuel; economic analysis; ethanol; fuel consumption; future prospect; global warming; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon; petroleum; weather; Crude Oil; Emission; Ethanol; Greenhouse Gases; Hydrocarbons; Investment; Meteorology; Solid Wastes; Transport; USA; Wood Products; Indiana; United States; Zea mays",,,,,,"(2009) Annual energy review 2008, , http://www.eia.doe.gov/aer/, DOE EIA, U.S.Department of Energy, Energy Information of Administration; (2009) Carbon dioxide emissions from energy sources 2008 flash estimate, , http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/flash/flash.html, DOE EIA, U.S.Department of Energy, Energy Information of Administration; Gasoline stocks and days of supply, , http://www.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/twip/twip_gasoline.html, U.S.Department of Energy, Energy Information of Administration; Greene, D.L., Plotkin, S.E., Energy futures for the US transport sector (2001) Energy Policy, 29, p. 1255; Devi, L., Ptasinski, K.J., Janssen, F.J.J.G., A review of the primary measures for tar elimination in biomass gasification processes (2003) Biomass Bioenergy, 24, p. 125; Reed, M.E., (2007) Increasing security and reducing carbon emissions of the U.S. transportation sector: a transformational role for coal with biomass, , DOE/NETL; Hedegaard, K., Thyø, K.A., Wenzel, H., Life cycle assessment of an advanced bioethanol technology in the perspective of constrained biomass availability (2008) Environ Sci Technol, 42, p. 7992; Roberts, K.G., Gloy, B.A., Joseph, S., Scott, N.R., Lehmann, J., Life cycle assessment of biochar systems: estimating the energetic, economic, and climate change potential (2009) Environ Sci Technol, 44, p. 827; Thomas, V.M., Choi, D.G., Luo, D., Okwo, A., Wang, J.H., Relation of biofuel to bioelectricity and agriculture: food security, fuel security, and reducing greenhouse emissions (2009) Chem Eng Res Des, 87, p. 1140; Rajagopal, D., Sexton, S.E., Roland-Holst, D., Zilberman, D., Challenge of biofuel: filling the tank without emptying the stomach?
