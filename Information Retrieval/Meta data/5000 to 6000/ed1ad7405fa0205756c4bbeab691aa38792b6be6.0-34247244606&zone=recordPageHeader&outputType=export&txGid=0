Nutrients fuel the growth of phytoplankton, the base of a very productive coastal marine ecosystem [Pauly D, Christensen V (1995) Nature 374:255-257]. Because nutrient supply and phytoplankton biomass in shelf waters are highly sensitive to variation in upwelling-driven circulation, shifts in the timing and strength of upwelling may alter basic nutrient and carbon fluxes through marine food webs. We show how a 1-month delay in the 2005 spring transition to upwelling-favorable wind stress in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem resulted in numerous anomalies: warm water, low nutrient levels, low primary productivity, and an unprecedented low recruitment of rocky intertidal organisms. The delay was associated with 20- to 40-day wind oscillations accompanying a southward shift of the jet stream. Early in the upwelling season (May-July) off Oregon, the cumulative upwelling-favorable wind stress was the lowest in 20 years, nearshore surface waters averaged 2°C warmer than normal, surf-zone chlorophyll-a and nutrients were 50% and 30% less than normal, respectively, and densities of recruits of mussels and barnacles were reduced by 83% and 66%, respectively. Delayed early-season upwelling and stronger late-season upwelling are consistent with predictions of the influence of global warming on coastal upwelling regions. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate variability; Coastal marine ecosystems; Coastal ocean upwelling; Marine ecology","carbon; chlorophyll a; surface water; chlorophyll; article; barnacle; biomass; climate change; environmental stress; food web; greenhouse effect; intertidal species; marine environment; mussel; nonhuman; nutrient supply; phytoplankton; priority journal; seashore; seawater upwelling; United States; animal; biology; chemistry; ecology; ecosystem; food chain; metabolism; methodology; Mytilus; sea; temperature; Thoracica; Thoracica; Animals; Biomass; California; Carbon; Chlorophyll; Ecology; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Marine Biology; Mytilus; Oceans and Seas; Oregon; Phytoplankton; Temperature; Thoracica",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; Carbon, 7440-44-0; chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; Chlorophyll, 1406-65-1",,,,"Pauly, D., Christensen, V., (1995) Nature, 374, pp. 255-257; Wooster, W.S., Reid, J.L., (1963) The Sea, 2, pp. 253-280. , ed Hill MN Wiley, New York; Huyer, A., Sobey, E.J.C., Smith, R.L., (1979) J Geophys Res, 84, pp. 6995-7011; Menge, B.A., Daley, B.A., Lubchenco, J., Sanford, E., Dahlhoff, E., Halpin, P.M., Hudson, G., Burnaford, J., (1999) Ecol Monogr, 69, pp. 297-330; Bakun, A., (1990) Science, 247, pp. 198-201; Snyder, M.A., Sloan, L.C., Diffenbaugh, N.S., Bell, J.L., (2003) Geophys Res Lett, 30, p. 1823; Menge, B.A., Daley, B.A., Wheeler, P.A., Dahlhoff, E., Sanford, E., Strub, P.T., (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 94, pp. 14530-14535; MacIsaac, J.J., Dugdale, R.C., Barber, R.T., Blasco, D., Packard, T.T., (1985) Deep-Sea Res, 32, pp. 503-529; Connolly, S.R., Menge, B.A., Roughgarden, J., (2001) Ecol, 82, pp. 1799-1813; Edwards, M., Richardson, A.J., (2004) Nature, 430, pp. 881-884; Beaugrand, G., Brander, K.M., Lindley, J.A., Souissi, S., Reid, P.C., (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 661-664; Menge, B.A., Lubchenco, J., Bracken, M.E.S., Chan, F., Foley, M.M., Freidenburg, T.L., Gaines, S.D., Leslie, H., (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 12229-12234; Strathmann, M.F., (1987) Reproduction and Development of Marine Invertebrates of the Northern Pacific Coast, , Univ Wash Press, Seattle; Phillips, N.E., (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 2562-2574; Farrell, T.M., Bracher, D., Roughgarden, J., (1991) Limnol Oceanogr, 36, pp. 279-288; Menge, B.A., Branch, G.M., (2001) Marine Community Ecology, pp. 221-251. , eds Bertness MD, Gaines SD, Hay ME Sinauer, Sunderland, MA, pp; Sydeman, W.J., Bradley, R.W., Warzybok, P., Abraham, C.L., Jahncke, J., Hyrenbach, K.D., Kousky, V., Ohman, M.D., (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L22S09; Thomas, A.C., Brickley, P., (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L22S05; Leslie, H.M., Breck, E., Chan, F., Lubchenco, J., Menge, B.A., (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 10534-10539; Menge, B.A., (1995) Ecol Mon, 65, pp. 21-74; Breaker, L.C., Liu, P.C., Torrence, C., (2001) Cont Shelf Res, 21, pp. 727-750; Bane, J.M., Levine, M.D., Samelson, R.M., Haines, S.M., Meaux, M.F., Perlin, N., Kosro, P.M., Boyd, T., (2005) J Geophys Res, 110, pp. C10S02; Lott, F., Robertson, A.W., Ghil, M., (2001) Geophys Res Lett, 28, pp. 1207-1210; Large, W.G., Pond, S., (1981) J Phys Oceanogr, 11, pp. 324-336; Kalnay, E., Kanamitsu, M., Kistler, R., Collins, W., Deaven, D., Gandin, L., Iredell, M., Woollen, J., (1996) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 77, pp. 437-471; Grasshoff, K., Kremling, K., Ehrhardt, M., (1999) Methods of Seawater Analysis, , Wiley, Weinheim, Germany; Welshmeyer, N.A., (1994) Limnol Oceanogr, 39, pp. 1985-1992; Menge, B.A., Berlow, E.L., Blanchette, C.A., Navarrete, S.A., Yamada, S.B., (1994) Ecol Monogr, 64, pp. 249-286","Barth, J.A.; College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, United States; email: barth@coas.oregonstate.edu",,,,,,,,00278424,,PNASA,17360419,"English","Proc.
