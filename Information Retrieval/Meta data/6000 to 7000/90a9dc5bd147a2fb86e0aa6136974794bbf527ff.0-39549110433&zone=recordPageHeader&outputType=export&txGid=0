The aim of this work was to prepare cellulose acetate membranes from nata-de-coco using coconut water as starting material. The use of this lignin-free material will certainly minimize the use of chemicals usually needed in the traditional pulps and substitute for the use of wood, which helps prevent global warming and preserves nature as well. Results: Coconut water was fermented by Acetobacter xylinum for 6 days to produce nata-de-coco, which was then acetylated. to produce cellulose diacetate with an acetyl content of 39.6%. Fourier transform infrared analysis showed characteristic peaks for the acetyl group at 1748 and 1236 cm-1. The resulting membranes made from the hydrolysis product showed a water flux of 210.5 L m-%2 h-1 under an applied pressure of 2 kg cm-2 while the rejection coefficients of dextran T-500 and T-2000 solutions were 78 and 93.7%, respectively. Conclusion: Coconut water has a potential to be used in the fabrication of membranes by converting it to nata-de-coco and then to cellulose diacetate which gives an added value to its original nature. It is also highly competitive compared to the traditional pulps, by which acetylation decreases the degree of crystallinity of nata-de-coco resulting in higher membrane permeability. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.","Acetobacter xylinum; Coconut water; Microfiltration; Nata-de-coco","Acetylation; Cellulose; Fermentation; Hydrolysis; Lignin; Mechanical permeability; Pulp; Cellulose acetate membranes; Coconut water; Water flux; Polymeric membranes; Acetylation; Cellulose; Fermentation; Hydrolysis; Lignin; Mechanical permeability; Polymeric membranes; Pulp; Acetylation; Cellulose Diacetate; Crystallinity; Fermentation; Hydrolysis; Lignins; Permeability; Pulps; cellulose acetate; filtration; hydrolysis; membrane; pulp",,,,,,"Mulder, M., Separation processes (1996) Basic Principles of Membrane Technology, p. 1. , 2nd edn.
