In Japan, to precisely estimate PFC emissions under the Tier 2c method, the use rate of SF6 and the abatement efficiency of PFC gases used now have been measured, in situ, using LCD production lines. Some values were found to be quite different from default values given in the IPCC guidelines. Meanwhile, PFC emissions from the Japanese LCD industry has since been kept the same emission level of the year 2000, although purchases have increased with the years, as a result of reduction steps it has taken so far.",,"Air pollution; Industrial management; Production engineering; Purchasing; Abatement efficiency; Guidelines; Production lines; Liquid crystal displays",,,,,,"(2001) Joint Statement on the First WLICC Meeting in Japan; (2003) Joint Statement on the Second WLICC Meeting in Japan; Nishida, H., (2004) 15th Annual Earth Technologies Forum in Washington DC; Signatory ceremony on PFC emission reduction target between the Taiwanese LCD association and Taiwan's EPA in Taipei (2004)Cheng, J.-H., (2004) Solid State Technologies (in Taiwan Version); Matsumura, K., (2004) 11th ISESH in Japan; Leu, C.-H., (2004) 15th Annual Earth Technologies Forum in Washington DC","Matsumura, K.; Toshiba Matsushita Display Technology Co.
