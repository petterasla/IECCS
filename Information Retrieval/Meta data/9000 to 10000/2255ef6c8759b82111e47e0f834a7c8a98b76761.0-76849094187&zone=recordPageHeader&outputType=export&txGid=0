In a data center, the percentage of energy consumed by air conditioning is high at about 40%, and reducing this energy use has become a major issue against the background of global warming. To make detailed temperature measurements with the aim of achieving energy-efficient data centers, we have developed multipoint measuring technology to increase the spatial resolution by more than twice that of existing technology. This uses a new algorithm for correcting signal processing output from temperature-distribution measuring equipment that utilizes Raman-scattering light in an optical fiber. We have also developed technology for fast and reliable laying of optical fiber on server racks. These technologies enable accurate and detailed measurement of temperature distributions in data centers, which should in turn lead to optimal air conditioning and an energy-saving effect.",,"Data centers; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Energy use; Energy-saving effect; Information technology infrastructure; IT equipment; Measurement of temperature; Measuring equipments; Multipoint; Multipoint measuring; Scattering light; Spatial resolution; Air conditioning; Energy conservation; Global warming; Optical fibers; Optical materials; Satellite communication systems; Signal processing; Temperature measurement; Information technology",,,,,,"Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency (2007) Public Law, 109-431. , http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod-development/downloads/EPA-Dat acenter-Report-Congress-Finall.pdf; (2008) Trade and Industry (METI): Promoting Green IT Initiatives, , http://www.csaj.jp/seminar/2008/081006-meti.pdf, Ministry of Economics, in Japanese, October; Kikuchi, K., Measurement of Raman Scattering in Single-Mode optical Fiber by Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (1988) IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, 24 (10), pp. 1973-1975; Wait, P.C., A theoretical comparison of spontaneous Raman and Brillouin based fibre optic distributed temperature sensors (1997) Optics Communications, 144, pp. 17-23. , Issues 1-3, pp; Hotate, K., Fiber Sensor Technology Today (1997) Optical Fiber Technology, 3 (4), pp. 356-402; Farahani, M.A., Gogolla, T., Spontaneous Raman scattering in optical fibers with modulated probe light for distributed temperature Raman remote sensing (1999) J.
