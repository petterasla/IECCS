Among them, transport vehicles consume one third of the oil, 100 GL/year, and emit 20 percent of the CO2, 61 MtC/year. Then, the substitution of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) for the structural material of transport vehicle is quite effective in lightening, fuel efficiency and hence the mitigation of global warming. In this paper, life cycle CO2 emission and energy consumption of the ultra lightweight automobile using CFRP are presented first. Then, the effect of lightweight and fuel cell automobiles on the mitigation of global oil consumption and CO2 emission is estimated under the assumption of Asian motorization.","Automobile; CFRP; CO2 emission; Fuel cell; LCA; Oil consumption","Oil consumption; Automobiles; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"(2001) Report of the Working Group I of IPCC, , http://www.ipcc.ch/, Technical Summary, Sep; Oil Statistics List, , http://www.paj.gr.jp/html/english/index.html, Petroleum Association of Japan; Environmental White Paper 2001-2002, , Ministry of the Environment, Japan; (1996) Report on the LCA of Automobile, , Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Inc; Suzuki, T., Teshiba, F., Zushi, H., Takahashi, J., Kageyama, K., Yoshinari, H., Life cycle assessment of lightweight automobiles using CFRP (2002) Proceedings of the 2002 Annual Meeting of Japan Society of Mechanical Engineering, , to be presented at 2002-9-26, (in Japanese); Nagaoka, S., Zushi, H., Takahashi, J., Yoshinari, H., Kageyama, K., Public acceptance assessment of ultra lightweight vehicles using CFRP (From cost and 3R viewpoints) (2002) Proceedings of the 2002 Annual Meeting of Japan Society of Mechanical Engineering","Zushi, H.; Dept. of Environmental Engineering, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan","Geni M.Kikuchi M.","Xinjiang University;Tokyo University of Science;Lanzhou",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Experimental and Computational Mechanics in Engineering","24 August 2002 through 27 August 2002","Dunhuang",61114,10139826,,KEMAE,,"English","Key Eng Mat",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038578271
