Box 6, Bet Dagan 50-250, Israel","Although many studies indicate a relation between global warming and variation in spatial and temporal butterfly distribution, detailed studies are lacking on the importance of local climatic factors on butterfly community composition. We studied the relation between climatic factors and seasonality on butterfly community composition in a Mediterranean climate-type region. The butterfly diversity measures were mainly affected by maximum daily radiation, minimum daily relative humidity, and temperature variables. We suggest extending butterfly monitoring at Long Term Ecological Research stations in Israel, which will allow separating the effect of climatic changes and/or change in local factors on butterfly community composition.","Bio-indicator; Biodiversity; Butterflies; Climatic factors; LTER; Mediterranean; Monitoring; Radiation; Temperature","biodiversity; butterfly; community composition; environmental effect; global warming; seasonality; spatial distribution; temperature effect; temporal distribution; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Papilionoidea",,,,,,"Bolotov, I.N., Long-term changes in the fauna of diurnal lepidopterans (Lepidoptera, Diurna) in the northern taiga subzone of the western Russian plain (2004) Russian Journal of Ecology, 35, pp. 117-123; Boonvanno, K., Watanasif, S., Permkam, S., Butterfly diversity at Ton Nga-Chang wildlife sanctuary, Songkha Provinee, Southern Thailand (2000) Science Asia, 26, pp. 105-110; Clench, H.K., Behavioral thermoregulation in butterflies (1966) Ecology, 47, pp. 1021-1034; Colwell, R.K., Mao, C.X., Chang, J., Interpolating, extrapolating, and comparing incidence-based species accumulation curves (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 2717-2727; Hoyle, M., James, M., Global warming, human population pressure, and viability of the worlds smallest butterfly (2005) Conservation Biology, 19 (4), pp. 1113-1124; Kühn, E., Feldmann, R., Harpke, A., Hirneisen, N., Leopold, P., Settele, J. 2008.
