The results show the increase in groundwater recharge rate from the 1890s to 1940s, and it decreased from the 1940s to 1990s. These estimations agree well with the precipitation record in Tokyo during the last 100 years. Therefore, the deep borehole temperature data can be used for estimating not only surface temperature history but also the past groundwater recharge rate in Tokyo area. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
