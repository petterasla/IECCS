Crabs from the highly contaminated site were significantly larger in size, but had lower population density, lower recruitment, reduced reproductive season and lower survivorship of early benthic phases. Our study suggests that contamination may play a role in population ecology of U. pugnax. This study also determined that the reproductive season for U. pugnax in New Jersey is much longer than reported in the literature and could potentially be impacted by global climate change. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"crab; fecundity; morphology; pollution exposure; population density; population size; recruitment (population dynamics); reproductive biology; survivorship; New Jersey; North America; United States; Decapoda (Crustacea); Minuca pugnax; Ocypodidae",,,,,,"Able, K.W., Hoden, R., Witting, D., Durand, J.B., (1992) Physical Parameters of the Great Bay-Mullica River Estuary, , Technical Report.
