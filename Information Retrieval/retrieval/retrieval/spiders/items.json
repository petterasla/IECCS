In order to be able to predict the ecological effects of the global climate change, it is necessary to study monitoring databases of the past and explore connections. For the case study mentioned in the title, historical weather data series from the Hungarian Meteorological Service and Szaniszl\u00f3 Priszter's monitoring data on the phenology of geophytes have been used. These data describe on which days the observed geophytes budded, were blooming and withered. In our research we have found that the classification of the observed years according to phenological events and the classification of those according to the frequency distribution of meteorological parameters show similar patterns, and the one variable group is suitable for explaining the pattern shown by the other one. Furthermore, our important result is that the dates of all three observed phenophases correlate significantly with the average of the daily temperature fluctuation in the given period. The second most often significant parameter is the number of frosty days, this also seem to be determinant for all phenophases. Usual approaches based on the temperature sum and the average temperature don't seem to be really important in this respect. According to the results of the research, it has turned out that the phenology of geophytes can be well modelled with the linear combination of suitable meteorological parameters. \u00a9 2009, Penkala Bt., Budapest, Hungary."]},

Day warming showed no effect on soil respiration, whereas night warming significantly increased soil respiration by 7.1% over the 3 growing seasons in 2006-2008. The insignificant effect of day warming on soil respiration could be attributable to the offset of the direct positive effects of increased temperature by the indirect negative effects via aggravating water limitation and suppressing ecosystem C assimilation. The positive effects of night warming on soil respiration were largely due to the stimulation of ecosystem C uptake and substrate supply via overcompensation of plant photosynthesis. Changes in both soil respiration (+20.7 g C m", " y", ") and GEP (-2.8 g C m", " y", ") under diurnal warming are smaller than their summed changes (+40.0 and +24.6 g C m", " y", ", respectively) under day and night warming.

Thus, organisms need to employ effective mechanisms to ensure survival under stressful thermal conditions, among which phenotypic plasticity is considered a particularly quick and effective one. Methodology/Principal Findings:In a series of experiments we here investigate phenotypic adjustment in temperature stress resistance following environmental manipulations in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Cooler compared to warmer acclimation temperatures generally increased cold but decreased heat stress resistance and vice versa. In contrast, short-time hardening responses revealed more complex patterns, with, e.g., cold stress resistance being highest at intermediate hardening temperatures. Adult food stress had a negative effect on heat but not on cold stress resistance. Additionally, larval feeding treatment showed interactive effects with adult feeding for heat but not for cold stress resistance, indicating that nitrogenous larval resources may set an upper limit to performance under heat stress. In contrast to expectations, cold resistance slightly increased during the first eight days of adult life. Light cycle had marginal effects on temperature stress resistance only, with cold resistance tending to be higher during daytime and thus active periods. Conclusions/Significance: Our results highlight that temperature-induced plasticity provides an effective tool to quickly and strongly modulate temperature stress resistance, and that such responses are readily reversible. However, resistance traits are not only affected by ambient temperature, but also by, e.g., food availability and age, making their measurement challenging. The latter effects are largely underexplored and deserve more future attention. Owing to their magnitude, plastic responses in thermal tolerance should be incorporated into models trying to forecast effects of global change on extant biodiversity. \u00a9 2010 Fischer et al."]},

Current remote sensing techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor the cryosphere routinely with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, we introduce a thermodynamic model to estimate sea and lake ice thickness with optical (visible, near-infrared, and infrared) satellite data. Comparisons of nighttime ice thickness retrievals to ice thickness measurements from upward looking submarine sonar show that this thermodynamic model is capable of retrieving ice thickness up to 2.8 m. The mean absolute error is 0.18 m for samples with a mean ice thickness of 1.62 m, i.e., an 11% mean absolute error. Comparisons with in situ Canadian stations and moored upward looking sonar measurements show similar results. Sensitivity studies indicate that the largest errors come from uncertainties in surface albedo and downward solar radiation flux estimates from satellite data, followed by uncertainties in snow depth and cloud fractional coverage. Due to the relatively large uncertainties in current satellite retrievals of surface albedo and surface downward shortwave radiation flux, the current model is not recommended for use with daytime data. For nighttime data, the model is capable of resolving regional and seasonal variations in ice thickness and is useful for climatological analysis. \u00a9 2010 by the American Geophysical Union."]},

We present results of warming (4\u00b0C above ambient) and increased nutrient loading on plankton communities in 48 outdoor mesocosms, simulating fishless and hypertrophic ponds. The timing of the chlorophyll a peak and crustacean zooplankton peak abundance, dominated by Daphnia pulex, responded strongly to temperature and nutrient addition. Daphnia numbers reached peaks 22-24 days earlier in heated than in unheated mesocosms. The chlorophyll a peak abundance advanced by 15-19 days with heating. Phytoplankton, total zooplankton and D. pulex reached peak abundance 12-19 days later when doses of nitrogen and phosphorus were added; this finding contradicts predicted earlier phytoplankton and zooplankton spring peak abundances with nutrient enrichment. Peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances did not differ with temperature treatment, contrary to our expectations, but peak abundances occurred at similar actual temperatures. Nutrient additions had no effect on the peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances in our mesocosms. Overall, climate warming is likely to advance plankton phenology in fishless ponds; however, this advance could be dampened in systems with high nutrient concentration. We found very high zooplankton abundances with warming and high nutrient loadings inducing a clear water state in all our tanks owing to heavy zooplankton grazing despite high nutrient concentrations. \u00a9 The Author 2010.

The aims of this study were (1) to quantify aboveground and belowground biomass and respective carbon storage and (2) to project the future carbon storage in temperate forests landscape in Cofre de Perote, Veracruz, Mexico. Aboveground and belowground biomass was estimated in seven forests with different species composition and conservation status and management, in three grasslands and in two shrublands at a range of altitudes. Total biomass in forests ranged from 91.07 to 383.78 Mg ha", ", in grassland from 9.83 to 24.93 Mg ha", " and in successional (shrublands) from 6.33 to 7.69 Mg ha", ". This suggests that deforestation and changes of land use could reduce aboveground biomass by 90 per cent. Mature forests had the largest aboveground and belowground biomass and the lowest density (number of trees per hectare) but a lower potential for accumulation of C in the future; in contrast, young forests and reforested areas had higher growth and carbon storage potential.

When intermittency occurs in river ecosystems, hydrologic connectivity is interrupted and this affects benthic, hyporheic and flowing water compartments. Organic matter use and transport can be particularly affected during the transition from wet to dry and dry to wet conditions. In order to characterize the changes in benthic organic matter quantity and quality throughout a drying and rewetting process, organic matter, and enzyme activities were analyzed in the benthic accumulated material (biofilms growing on rocks and cobbles, leaves, and sand) and in flowing water (dissolved and particulate fractions). The total polysaccharide, amino acid, and lipid content in the benthic organic matter were on average higher in the drying period than in the rewetting period. However, during the drying period, peptide availability decreased, as indicated by decreases in leucine aminopeptidase activity, as well as amino acid content in the water and benthic material, except leaves; while polysaccharides were actively used, as indicated by an increase in \u03b2-glucosidase activity in the benthic substrata and an increase in polysaccharide content of the particulate water fraction and in leaf material. During this process, microbial heterotrophs were constrained to use the organic matter source of the lowest quality (polysaccharides, providing only C), since peptides (providing N and C) were no longer available. During the flow recovery phase, the microbial community rapidly recovered, suggesting the use of refuges and/or adaptation to desiccation during the previous drought period. The scouring during rewetting was responsible for the mobilization of the streambed and loss of benthic material, and the increase in high quality organic matter in transport (at that moment, polysaccharides and amino acids accounted for 30% of the total DOC). The dynamics of progressive and gradual drought effects, as well as the fast recovery after rewetting, might be affected by the interaction of the individual dynamics of each benthic substratum: sand sediments and leaves providing refuge for microorganisms and organic matter storage, while on cobbles, an active bacterial community is developed in the rewetting. Since global climate change may favor a higher intensity and frequency of droughts in streams, understanding the effects of these disturbances on the materials and biota could contribute to reliable resource management. The maintenance of benthic substrata heterogeneity within the stream may be important for stream recovery after droughts. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."]},

Such changes in the flow regime may have major implications in freshwater ecosystems and, in particular, in the organic carbon dynamics in semiarid stream ecosystems. Much is known about the role of extreme flow events on structuring stream ecosystems, but few studies explored the effects of extreme flow events magnitude, timing, and sequence on stream ecosystems. To assess the effect of extreme events on stream organic C dynamics, a simple and flexible modeling approach was applied to simulate the organic carbon dynamics in a simplified river reach. The river reach model was initially calibrated and tested using long-term data for stream water velocity and amount of organic carbon in sediment. After that, multiple scenarios differing in the extreme flow events (floods and droughts) sequence and magnitude were used to simulate the effects of possible flow regime changes on the stream organic carbon dynamics. Initial expectations were that: (i) an increase in the magnitude or frequency of extreme flow events would reduce the amount of organic carbon respired within the simulated river reach, and (ii) relationship between the timings of the extreme flow events and of the litterfall input would influence considerably the effects of the extreme flow events. Results pointed out that: (i) the amount of processed carbon respect the amount entering the ecosystem was affected by extreme events such floods and droughts, but the relevance of those events differed along the year, with a maximal effect during the litterfall period; (ii) extreme event timing rather than the magnitude was more relevant to the stream organic carbon dynamics; and (iii) the amount of respired carbon in the ecosystem could be amplified or reduced depending on event sequence. Increasing awareness of the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle and the shaping role of hydrology on the stream organic carbon dynamics stress the need to better quantify carbon fluxes and the hydrological controls on these fluxes. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."]},

We observe that a statistically significant trend at a specific monitoring site, using one exposure metric, does not necessarily result in a similar trend using the other two metrics. The two most common trends among the monitoring sites are either a continuation of negative trending over the 29-year period or a shift from negative to no trend status, indicating a leveling off of the trending. Very few sites exhibit statistically significant increases in the exposure indices. In characterizing the statistically significant changes in the distribution of hourly average O ", ", we observe subtle statistically significant changes in the lower part of the distribution (i.e., below 50ppb) that are not necessarily captured by the trending patterns associated with the three exposure metrics. Using multisite data from 12 metropolitan cities, we find that as the frequency of higher hourly average concentrations is reduced, the lower hourly average concentrations also move upward toward the mid-level values. The change in the number of the hourly average concentrations in the lower range is consistent with decreased NO scavenging. We recommend assessing possible subtle shifts in O ", " concentrations by characterizing changes in the distribution of hourly average concentrations by month. Identifying statistically significant monthly changes in the mid- and low-level hourly average concentrations may provide important information for assessing changes in physical processes associated with global climate change, long-range transport, and the efficacy of models used for emission and risk reductions. Our results indicate that it is important to investigate the change in the trending pattern with time (e.g., moving 15-year trending) in order to assess how year-to-year variability may influence the trend calculation. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd."]},

We show that changes in SOC stocks over short periods of time are difficult to detect, and explore the potential for models to be used for reporting SOC changes for forests that will remain forests, under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. As the eddy covariance flux sites have been active for 10-yr on average, being initiated over the period between 1996 and 1998, the model was evaluated by comparing the modelled SOC stocks with those directly measured at each site in different years. Since long term series of observed values for soil carbon were not available, the validation of other model outputs such as net primary production (NPP) and soil nitrogen stocks, gives some confidence in long term simulations. Once the model performance was evaluated, two climate change scenarios, A1F1 (world markets-fossil fuel intensive) and B2 (local sustainability), were considered for prediction of C stock changes during the commitment periods of the Kyoto Protocol. In general, despite the need to consider the uncertainties in the direct measurements, at each site model fit with measured SOC stocks was good, with the simulated values within the standard deviation of the measurements. In this regard, the similarity between the SOC measured in 2008 and that predicted for the two forthcoming commitment periods points out the difficulty of detecting carbon stock changes by direct measurements, given the closeness in time to the present of the commitment periods. In any case, all sites show positive variations that are possibly related to the fertilization effects of increasing CO", " and to longer growing seasons, since no change in management occurred. Compared with the SOC measured in 2008, at the end of the second commitment period, the modelled SOC variations were smaller than 2% in the Mediterranean forests and comprised between 2% and 7% in the mountain forests. These variations, although small, indicate it might be possible to statistically detect differences after 10-yr in mountain forests with a reasonable number of samples. In conclusion, this work shows that since SOC stock changes are minimal within both CP, models can be effective tools for estimating future changes in SOC amounts, as an alternative to, or in support of, direct measurements when a short period of time is considered. \u00a9 2010 The Authors.

We explore to what extent future increases in agricultural productivity might offset conversion of tropical forest lands to crop lands under a climate mitigation policy and a contrasting no-policy scenario in a global integrated assessment model.

We find that tropical forests are preserved near their present-day extent, and bioenergy crops emerge as an effective mitigation option, only in cases in which a climate mitigation policy that includes an economic price for land-use emissions is in place, and in which agricultural productivity growth continues throughout the century. We find that idealized land-use emissions price assumptions are most effective at limiting deforestation, even when cropland area must increase to meet future food demand.
