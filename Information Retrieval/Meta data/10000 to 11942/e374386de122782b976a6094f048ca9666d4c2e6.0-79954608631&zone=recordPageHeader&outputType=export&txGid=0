These policies provide economic incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A life-cycle inventory model was developed to evaluate three alternatives for the management of waste hot mix asphalt (HMA) including, (1) recycling as new aggregate, (2) recycling as new HMA, and (3) disposal in a landfill. Global warming potential, environmental emissions, and total energy use were quantified for each management alternative. The recycling of used asphalt into new HMA results in a reduction of 16 kg CO2e compared to landfilling. Recycling used HMA as aggregate reduced GHG emissions by 9 kg CO2e. A Monte Carlo analysis on the alternatives showed that the range of reduction for recycling as HMA was 12 to 26 kg CO2e and for recycling as aggregate 6 to 11 kg CO2e. © 2011 Lavoisier, Paris.","Global warming; Life-cycle assessment; Rap; Recycling; Waste asphalt concrete",,,,,,,"Camobreco, V., Ham, R., Barlaz, M., Repa, E., Felker, M., Rousseau, C., Rathle, J., Life-cycle inventory of a modern municipal solid waste landfill (1999) Waste Management and Research, 17 (6), pp. 394-408; Dumas, R.D., (1997) Energy Consumption and Emissions Related to Electricity Generation and Remanufacturing Processes in a life Cycle Inventory of Solid Waste Management, , Master's Thesis, Raleigh, North Carolina: Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University; Hazen, A., (1930) Flood Flows, , New York, John Wiley; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Natural Gas Combustion in an Industrial Boiler, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory., Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Diesel Combustion in Industrial Equipment, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Bituminous Coal Combustion in an Industrial Boiler, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Gasoline Combustion in Industrial Equipment, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Distillate Oil Combustion in an Industrial Boiler, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Residual Oil Combustion in an Industrial Boiler, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory., Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Transportation -Gasoline Powered Single Unit Truck, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Transportation -Diesel Powered Single Unit Truck, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Transportation-Gasoline Powered Combination Truck, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory., Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Transportation -Diesel Powered Combination Truck, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Fuels and Energy Precombustion, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Limestone Mining and Lime Production, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/database/default.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; (2004) U.S. LCI Database: Petroleum Refining, , http://www.nrel.gov/lci/databasedefault.asp, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO; Solano, E., Ranjithan, S.R., Barlaz, M.A., Brill, E.D., Life-cycle-based solid waste management.
