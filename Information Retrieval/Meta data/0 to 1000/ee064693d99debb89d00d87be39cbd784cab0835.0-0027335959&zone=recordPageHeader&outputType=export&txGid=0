Due to uncertainties about atmospheric chemistry, few attempts have been made to quantify the impact of emissions of NOx, non-methane hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Atmospheric chemistry modelling at Harwell Laboratory has resulted in preliminary estimates of the impact of trace gases including NOx, many hydrocarbon species, carbon monoxide and water vapour on global warming. These estimates have been applied to emissions from transport, with particular attention to cars. It is found that the use of three-way catalysts on cars could reduce their global warming impact. IDI diesel engines have still less global warming impact. High NOx, CO and hydrocarbon emissions from DI diesels could result in a higher impact from these engines than from IDI diesels. Emissions from aircraft are injected into the troposphere at the height where they have a maximal effect on global warming. Although modelling of aircraft impact is at a very early stage, the first results indicate that air travel could become an important cause of global warming. © 1993.","carbon dioxide; global warming; impact; nitrogen oxides; transport","air travel; carbon dioxide; catalyst potential; gas emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; man-environment relations; nitrogen oxide; transport; transport impact; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; air pollution; conference paper; controlled study; greenhouse effect; traffic",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Derwent, Trace Gases and Their Relative Contribution to the Greenhouse Effect (1990) Harwell Laboratory, Report R 13716; Hough, Johnson, Modelling the Role of Nitrogen Oxides, Hydrocarbons and Carbon Monoxide in the Global Formation of Tropospheric Oxidants (1990) Harwell Laboratory, Report R 13545; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press; Dunne, A Comparison of Various Emission Control Technology Cars and Their Influence on Exhaust Emissions and Fuel Economy (1990) Report LR 770 (AP), , Warren Spring Laboratory, UK; Department of Transport, UK, (1988) Transport Statistics Great Britain 1977–1987, , HMSO; Eurostat, (1990) Energy Balance Sheets 1987–1988, , Office des publications officielles des Communautés Européennes, Luxembourg; Johnson, Henshaw, The Impact of NOx Emissions from Tropospheric Aircraft (1991) CEC Study Contract CEC EV4V-0205-UK(A), , Harwell Laboratory; United States Department of Commerce, Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Vol. 2, Mobile Sources (1985) Document No. PG87-205266, , 4th edn., National Technical Information Service","Michaelis, L.",,,,,,,,00489697,,STEVA,,"English","Sci.
