Despite genetic variance for traits under selection, among-trait genetic correlations that are antagonistic to the direction of selection limit adaptive evolution within these populations. Predicted rates of evolutionary response are much slower than the predicted rate of climate change.",,"Genetic engineering; Evolutionary response; Global warming; adaptation; evolutionary biology; global warming; prairie; adaptation; article; climate; controlled study; gene structure; genetic variability; greenhouse effect; model; molecular evolution; nonhuman; North America; plant; prediction; priority journal; structure analysis; Adaptation, Physiological; Analysis of Variance; Climate; Evolution; Fabaceae; Greenhouse Effect; Likelihood Functions; Midwestern United States; Multivariate Analysis; Natural Disasters; Plant Leaves; Plants, Medicinal; Selection (Genetics); Variation (Genetics); North America",,,,,,"Davis, M.B., Shaw, R.G., (2001) Science, 292, p. 673; Groom, M.J., Schumaker, N., (1993) Biotic Interactions and Global Change, , P.
