It describes the achievement and progress made in hydropower, biomass conversion, geothermal, solar thermal technology, wind energy conversion, and the increasing usage of photovoltaics. The paper also addresses the barriers and problems facing renewable energy users and producers. It is evident that global warming is setting in and is going to change the climate as well as the terrain of many countries unless drastic measures are taken. The recent Kyoto meeting emphasized the importance of limiting CO2 emissions and abiding by some form of agreement to reduce emissions. The present study concludes that renewable energy penetration into the energy market is much faster than was expected in recent years and 2030, 15-20% of our prime energy will be met by renewable energy.","Energy demand; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Solar cells; Solar energy; Wind power; Biomass conversion; Energy demand; Hydropower; Solar thermal technology; Wind energy conversion; Renewable energy resources",,,,,,"(2001) Global Wind Energy Market Report, , http://www.awea.org, American Wind Energy Association (AWEA); Birol, F., Argiri, M., World energy prospects to 2020 (1999) Energy, 24, pp. 905-918; Renewable energy projects in Turkey, Ankara, Turkey (2001), http://www.temev.org.tr, Clean Energy Foundation (CEF)D'Apote, S.L., IEA biomass energy analysis and projections, biomass energy: Data, analysis and trends (1998) Conference Proceedings, Paris, pp. 151-179; Duffie, J.A., Beckman, W.A., (1991) Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes, , New York: John-Wiley; Hall, D.O., Biomass energy in industrialized countries - A view of the future (1997) Forest Ecology and Management, 91, pp. 17-45; Hutter, G.W., The status of world geothermal power generation 1995-2000 (2001) Geothermics, 30, pp. 1-27; (1998) World Energy Outlook, 1998 Edition, , IEA; Pari: IEA/OECD; The evolving renewable energy market, international energy agency (2000), http://www.iea.org, IEA; Paris: IEA/OECDKaygusuz, K., Hydropower and biomass as renewable energy sources in Turkey (2000) Energy Sources, 23, pp. 775-799; Lund, J.W., Freeston, D.H., World-wide direct uses of geothermal energy 2000 (2001) Geothermics, 30, pp. 29-68; Nogueira, L.A.H., Trossero, M.A., Introducing WEIS: The FAO wood energy information system, biomass energy: Data, analysis and trends (1998) Conference Proceedings, Paris, March; (2001), http://www.re-focus.net, Refocus (International Renewable Energy Magazine) June; Netherland: ElsevierSayigh, A., Renewable energy - The way forward (1999) Appl.
