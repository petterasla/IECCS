The module stresses the dependence of the optical properties of materials (transparency, absorptivity and emissivity) on radiation frequency, as a result of interaction between matter and radiation. Multiple experiences are suggested to favour a progressive construction of knowledge on the physical aspects necessary to understand the greenhouse effect and global warming. Some results obtained with university students are briefly reported. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Absorptivities; Infrared emissions; Optical properties of materials; Physical aspects; Radiation frequencies; Teacher education; Teaching module; University levels; University students; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouses; Materials properties; Optical properties; Radiation effects; Teaching; Greenhouse effect",,,,,,"Besson, U., Borghi, L., De Ambrosis, A., Mascheretti, P., A three-dimensional approach and open source structure for the design and experimentation of teaching learning sequences: The case of friction (2009) Int.
