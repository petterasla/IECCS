Ltd., 16-25, Shibaura, Minato-Ku, Tokyo, Japan","Growing concern about global warming has directed much attention towards natural gas-driven co-generation systems (CGS). For wider use of CGS in Japan, innovative technologies to utilize the waste heat of CGS more efficiently for the air-conditioning of office buildings have been long required. Tokyo Gas has developed a high-performance gas absorption chiller heater with auxiliary waste heat recovery. This paper presents the results of the development, including a numerical cycle simulation and experiments for heating and cooling. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Gas absorption chiller heater; Gas-driven co-generation systems; Waste heat","Air conditioning; Cogeneration plants; Computer simulation; Gas absorption; Heating; Ventilation; Gas absorption chiller heaters; Waste heat utilization",,,,,,"Kojima, H., Nakamura, M., Edera, M., Oka, M., Takeuchi, Y., Development of gas absorption chiller heater with auxiliary waste heat recovery (1995) 1995 International Gas Research Conference, pp. 96-105; Edera, M., Nakamura, M., Oka, M., Kojima, H., Development of gas absorption chiller heater with auxiliary waste heat recovery, part 2 (1994) Japanese Joint Conference on Air-conditioning and Refrigeration, pp. 129-132; Edera, M., Nakamura, M., Oka, M., Kojima, H., Development of gas absorption chiller heater with auxiliary waste heat recovery, part 3 (1995) Japanese Joint Conference on Air-conditioning and Refrigeration, pp. 145-148; Edera, M., Murata, Y., Development of high performance genelink (1998) Japanese Joint Conference on Air-conditioning and Refrigeration, pp. 133-136; Edera, M., Nakamura, M., Oka, M., Kojima, H., Development of gas absorption chiller heater with auxiliary waste heat recovery, part 1 (1994) Japanese Joint Conference on Air-conditioning and Refrigeration, pp. 125-128","Edera, M.; Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., 16-25, Shibaura, 1-Chome, Minato-Ku, Tokyo, Japan; email: edera@tokyo-gas.co.jp",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
