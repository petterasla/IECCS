We hypothesized increasing amounts and declining turnover times of soil organic matter (SOM) under permanent grassland with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Samples from an irrigated transect in the Swiss Alps (880 to 2200 m elevation, mean annual temperatures +8.9 to +0.9°C) were analyzed. Soil C stocks ranged from 49 to 96tCha-1 (0-20 cm) and were not related to elevation, though the highest site stored least C. Particulate organic carbon (POC) increased significantly with elevation and accounted for &gt;80% of the total soil C at 2200 m (0-5 cm). Mean residence times (MRTs) of POC computed by means of radiocarbon dating were in the order of years to decades and were positively related to elevation in the topsoil. At higher elevations, the estimated total C flux through the soil profile mainly depended on this fraction. MRT of mineral-associated matter ranged from decades to centuries and was not systematically related to elevation, but positively related to the soil mineral surface area and it increased with soil depth. Turnover rates from simulations with the soil C model RothC exceeded those from 14 C measurements by a factor of 1.7-3.3 which suggests that C dynamics at these sites is overestimated by the model. Size of model pools and amount of C in soil fractions were only weakly correlated, thereby challenging previously postulated hypotheses concerning the correspondence of pools and fractions for grasslands at higher elevations. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Global warming; Grassland; NaOCl; Radiocarbon; RothC; Soil carbon turnover; Soil fractionation","carbon sequestration; global warming; grassland soil; radiocarbon dating; soil carbon; soil organic matter; Alps; Eurasia; Europe",,,,,,"Bruun, S., Six, J., Jensen, L.S., Paustian, K., Estimating turnover of soil organic carbon fractions based on radiocarbon measurements (2005) Radiocarbon, 47, pp. 99-113; Bruun, S., Thomsen, I.K., Christensen, B.T., Jensen, L.S., In search of stable soil organic matter fractions: A comparison of methods applied to soils labelled with 14C for 40 days or 40 years (2008) European Journal of Soil Science, 59, pp. 247-256; Cambardella, C.A., Elliott, E.T., ""Particulate soil organic-matter changes across a grassland cultivation sequence"" (1992) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 56, pp. 777-783; Coleman, K., Jenkinson, D., (1999) RothC-26.3.
