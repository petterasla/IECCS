These include the consequences of melting such as subsidence (thermokarst topography) and instability of slopes (landslides, mudflows), as well as the thermodynamic and mechanical effects of freezing, especially frost heave. These effects have important geotechnical implications for the design of highways, airports, buildings and, notably pipelines. If there is global warming due to anthropogenic emissions of gases this will influence the direction and intensity of the ground disturbances. In the short term they will be masked by other ground temperature changes due to microclimatic effects and to inter-annual variability of climate and weather. -from Author",,"climate change; freeze/thaw; freeze/thaw effect; frozen soil; geotechnical damage; geotechnical properties; permafrost; permafrost warming; slope stability; subsidence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029544097
