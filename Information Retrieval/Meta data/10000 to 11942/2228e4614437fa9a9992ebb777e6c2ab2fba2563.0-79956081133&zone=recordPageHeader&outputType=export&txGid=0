Fluxes of N 2O, CO 2 and CH 4 from soil were measured under maize (Zea mays L.) grown using 0, 60 and 120 kg N hm -2 as NH 4NO 3-N and composted manure-N in three seasons on clay (Chromic luvisol) and sandy loam (Haplic lixisol) soils in Zimbabwe. The fluxes were measured using the static chamber methodology involving gas chromatography for ample air analysis. Over an average of 122 days we estimated emissions of 0.1 to 0.5 kg N 2O-N hm -2, 711 to 1574 kg CO 2-C hm -2 and-2.6 to 5.8 kg CH 4-C hm -2 from six treatments during season II with the highest fluxes. The posed hypothesis that composted manure-N may be better placed as a mitigation option against soil emissions of GHG than mineral fertilizer-N was largely supported by N 2O fluxes during the wet period of the year, but with high level of uncertainty. Nitrogen addition might have stimulated both emissions and consumption of CH 4 but the sink or source strength depended highly on soil water content. We concluded that the application of mineral-N and manure input may play an important role with reference to global warming provided the season can support substantial crop productivity that may reduce the amount of N 2O loss per unit yield. Confidence in fluxes response to agricultural management is still low due to sporadic measurements and limited observations from the southern African region. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cattle manure; Greenhouse gas; Maize; Mineral fertilizer; Plant captured carbon","agricultural emission; agricultural management; air sampling; cattle; clay; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; gas chromatography; global warming; greenhouse gas; maize; manure; sandy loam; seasonality; soil emission; soil water; water content; yield response; Zimbabwe; Bos; Zea mays",,,,,,"Anderson, I.P., Brinn, P.J., Moyo, M., Nyamwanza, B., Physical resource inventory of the communal areas of Zimbabwe - An Overview (1993) NRI Bulletin No.60, , National Resources Institute, Chatham; (2002) Simplified Production Factsheets on Selected Crops Grown in Zimbabwe, , ARI, Harare: Agronomy Research Institute, Department of Agricultural Research and Extension Publication; Baggs, E.M., Chebii, J., Ndufa, J.K., A short-term investigation of trace gas emissions following tillage and no-tillage of agroforestry residues in western Kenya (2006) Soil Tillage Res, 90, pp. 69-76; Bodelier, P.L.E., Laanbroek, H.J., Nitrogen as a regulatory factor of methane oxidation in soils and sediments (2004) FEMS Microbiol Ecol, 47, pp. 265-277; Bremmer, J.M., Mulvaney, C.S., Nitrogen - Total (1982) Methods of Soil Analysis, Agron.
