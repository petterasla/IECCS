Oligotrophic Arctic streams are likely to be sensitive to changes in hydrology and nutrient inputs predicted to occur as a consequence of future climate and land use change. To investigate the potential consequences of nutrient enrichment for low-order Arctic streams, we added ammonium-N and phosphorous to a second-order beaded, tundra stream on Alaska's north slope. We measured responses in nutrient chemistry, chlorophyll a standing crop, and in the breakdown and macroinvertebrate colonisation of leaf litter over a 38-day summer period. 2. During the addition, nutrient concentrations immediately downstream of the dripper averaged 6.4 μM ammonium-N and 0.45 μM soluble reactive P. Concentrations upstream of the dripper averaged 0.54 μM ammonium-N and 0.03 μM soluble reactive P. Uptake of both nutrients was rapid. Concentrations were reduced on average to 28% (ammonium-N) and 15% (inorganic P) of maximum values within 1500 m. Standing crops of chlorophyll a on standardised samplers were significantly higher by the end of the experiment. Breakdown rates of senescent willow (Salix sp.) and sedge (Carex sp.) litter and associated fungal biomass were also significantly increased by nutrient addition. 3. Fertilisation resulted in four- to sevenfold higher macroinvertebrate abundance and two-to fourfold higher macroinvertebrate biomass in litter bags, as well as an increase in late-summer body mass of larval Nemoura stoneflies. 4. Our results are consistent with those of similar studies of larger streams in the high-Arctic region. Based on our short-term experiment, increased inputs of nutrients into these ecosystems, whether caused by climate change or more local disturbance, are likely to have profound ecological consequences. Longer-term effects of enrichment, and their interaction with other components of future change in climate or land use, are more difficult to assess.","Alaska; Global climate change; High-latitude streams; Leaf litter breakdown; Nutrient enrichment","biological production; climate change; decomposition; ecosystem function; eutrophication; stream; tundra; Alaska; North America; North Slope; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Carex; Nemoura; Plecoptera; Salix; Salix sp.",,,,,,"Benke, A.C., Huryn, A.D., Smock, L.A., Wallace, J.B., Length-mass relationships for freshwater macroinvertebrates in North America with particular reference to the southeastern United States (1999) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 18, pp. 308-343; Bowden, W.B., Finlay, J.C., Maloney, P.E., Long-term effects of PO4 fertilization on the distribution of bryophytes in an Arctic stream (1994) Freshwater Biology, 32, pp. 445-454; Brett, M.T., Goldman, C.T., Consumer versus resource control in freshwater pelagic food webs (1997) Science, 275, pp. 384-386; Craig, P.C., McCart, P.J., Classification of stream types in Beaufort Sea drainages between Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and the Mackenzie Delta, N.W.T, Canada (1975) Arctic and Alpine Research, 7, pp. 183-198; Deegan, L.A., Peterson, B.J., Whole-river fertilization stimulates fish production in an Arctic tundra river (1992) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 49, pp. 1890-1901; Deegan, L.A., Golden, H.E., Harvey, C.J., Peterson, B.J., Influence of environmental variability on the growth of age-0 and adult Arctic grayling (1999) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 128, pp. 1163-1175; Epstein, H.E., Walker, M.D., Chapin III, F.S., Starfield, A.M., A transient, nutrient-based model of Arctic plant community response to climatic warming (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 824-841; Finlay, J.C., Bowden, W.B., Controls on production of bryophytes in an Arctic tundra stream (1994) Freshwater Biology, 32, pp. 455-465; Gessner, M.O., Chauvet, E., Ergosterol-to-biomass conversion factors for aquatic hyphomycetes (1993) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 59, pp. 502-507; Gessner, M.O., Chauvet, E., Importance of stream microfungi in controlling breakdown rates of leaf litter (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 1807-1817; Golden, H.E., Deegan, L.A., The trophic interactions of young Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in an Arctic tundra stream (1998) Freshwater Biology, 39, pp. 637-648; Grattan, R.M., Suberkropp, K., Effects of nutrient enrichment on yellow poplar leaf decomposition and fungal activity in streams (2001) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 20, pp. 33-43; Gulis, V., Suberkropp, K., Leaf litter decomposition and microbial activity in nutrient-enriched and unaltered reaches of a headwater stream (2003) Freshwater Biology, 48, pp. 123-134; Harvey, C.J., Peterson, B.J., Bowden, W.B., Deegan, L.A., Finlay, J.C., Hershey, A.E., Miller, M.C., Organic matter dynamics in the Kuparuk River, a tundra river in Alaska, USA (1997) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 16, pp. 3-161. , Stream Organic Matter Budgets (Eds J.R.
