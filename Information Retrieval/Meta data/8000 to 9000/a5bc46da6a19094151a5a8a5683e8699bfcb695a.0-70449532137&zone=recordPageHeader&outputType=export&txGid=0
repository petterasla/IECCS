Tree-line growth on Qilian Mountain was mainly limited by temperature at the low-frequency band. However, tree-line growth in the Anyemaqen Mountain was highly correlated with the current growing season temperature at the high-frequency band, and with the previous growing season precipitation at the low-frequency band. A temperature-stressed growth pattern at colder western sites and a moisture-stressed growth pattern at the warm, drier eastern tree-line sites were detected. The number of surviving trees in the tree-line ecotone was not clearly correlated with temperature before the 1900s. An unprecedented rise in the number of trees coincided well with the rapid global warming after the 1900s. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Age structure; Climate-growth relationship; Global warming; Tree ring; Tree-line dynamics; Tree-line ecotone","Age structure; Climate-growth relationship; Tree ring; Tree-line dynamics; Tree-line ecotone; Frequency bands; Global warming; Growth rate; Landforms; Forestry; Age; Forestry; Growth Rate; Rings; Structures; Trees; Juniperus; Juniperus przewalskii",,,,,,"Bekker, M.F., Positive feedback between tree establishment and patterns of subalpine forest advancement, Glacier National Park, Montana, USA (2005) Arc Antarct Alp Res, 37 (1), pp. 97-107; Callaghan, T.V., Werkman, B.R., Craford, R.M.M., The tundra-taiga interface and its dynamics: Concepts and applications (2002) Ambio Special Rep, 12, pp. 6-14; Camarero, J.J., Gutiérrez, E., Pace and pattern of recent tree line dynamics: Response of ecotones to climatic variability in the Spanish Pyrenees (2004) Clim Chang, 63, pp. 181-200; Cook, E.R., A time-series analysis approach to tree-ring standardization (1985) PhD Dissertation, , The University of Arizona, Tucson; Cook, E.R., Kairiukstis, L.A., (1990) Methods of Dendrochronology: Applications in the Environmental Sciences, , Dordrecht: Kluwer; Cui, H., Liu, H., Dai, J., (2005) Mountain Ecology and Alpine Tree-line Research, , Beijing: Science Press; D'Arrigo, R., Wilson, R., Jacoby, G., On the long-term context for late twentieth century warming (2006) J Geophys Res 111:D03103, , doi: 10.1029/2005JD006352; Dai, A.G., Trenberth, K.E., Qian, T., A global data set of palmer drought severity index for 1870-2002: Relationship with soil moisture and effects of surface warming (2004) J Hydrometeorol, 5, pp. 1117-1130; Dalen, L., Hofgaard, A., Differential regional treeline dynamics in the Scandes Mountains (2005) Arc Antarct Alp Res, 37 (3), pp. 284-296; Esper, J., Schweigruber, F.H., Large-scale tree-line changes recorded in Siberia (2004) Geophys Res Lett, 31, pp. L06202. , doi:10.1029/2003GL019178; Fang, K., Gou, X., Chen, F., Yang, M., Li, J., He, M., Zhang, Y., Peng, J., Drought variations in the eastern part of Northwest China over the past two centuries: Evidence from tree rings (2009) Clim Res, 38, pp. 129-135; Fang, K., Gou, X., Delphis, F.L., Li, J., Zhang, F., Liu, X., He, M., Peng, J., Variations of radial growth patterns in trees along three altitudinal transects in north central China (2009) J IAWA, , in press; Fritts, H.C., (1976) Tree Ring and Climate, , London: Academic Press; Goldblum, D., Rigg, L.S., Tree growth response to climate change at the deciduous-boreal forest ecotone, Ontario, Canada (2005) Can J For Res, 35, pp. 2709-2718; Gou, X., Chen, F., Jacoby, G., Cook, E., Yang, M., Peng, J., Zhang, Y., Rapid tree growth with respect to the last 400 years in response to climate warming, northeastern Tibetan Plateau (2007) Int J Climatol, 27, pp. 1497-1503; Harcombe, P.A., Tree life table (1987) Bioscience, 37, pp. 557-568; Holloway Jr., J.L., Smoothing and filtering of time series and space fields (1958) Advances of Geophysics, , H.
