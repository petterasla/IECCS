This methodology integrates Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model with Geographic Information System (GIS) and Inference Engine (IE) technique. EPIC was developed by USDA to analyze the relationship between soil erosion and agricultural productivity just at field level. With the integration of GIS, EPIC can be extended to the application of global or regional level. In this integration, IE is developed to determine possible crop combinations, the optimum starting and ending dates of growth cycle for each crop type and grid cell, in order to ensure best possible crop yields for both rain-fed and irrigated conditions. A case of global crop productivity estimation is tested with GIS-based EPIC in 2000. National averages are computed to be comparable to yields in FAO statistics. The comparison indicates that the GIS-based EPIC is able to simulate crop productivity at global level. In addition, with the global climate change data provided by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from the first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model (CGCMI), GIS-based EPIC is run for scenarios of future climate in the year of 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 to predict the effects of global warming on main crop yields. Results show the global warming will be harmful for most of the countries, and an efficient adaptation to alternative climates tends to reduce the damages. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
