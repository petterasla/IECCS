Researches indicate that glaciers of the three types show different response patterns to the global warming. Since the Maxima of the Little Ice Age (the 17th century), air temperature has risen at a magnitude of 1.3°C on average and the glacier area decreased corresponds to 20% of the present total glacier area in western China. It is estimated that air temperature rise in the 2030s, 2070s and 2100s will be of the order of 0.4-1.2, 1.2-2.7 and 2.1-4.0 K in western China. With these scenarios, glaciers in China will suffer from further shrinkage by 12%, 28% and 45% by the 2030s, 2070s and 2100s. The uncertainties may account for 30%-67% in 2100 in China.","Estimated glacier shrinkage; Glacier type; Global warming; Little Ice Age; Modern glacier; Temperature rise in the 21st century","air temperature; article; futurology; geology; global climate; greenhouse effect; history; temperature measurement",,,,,,"Oerlemans, J., Quantifying global warming from the retreat of glaciers (1994) Science, 264, p. 243; Oerlemans, J., Fortuin, J.P.F., Sensitivity of glaciers and Small ice caps to greenhouse warming (1992) Science, 258, p. 115; Zhang, X., Wang, Z., Glacier fluctuations in the western China and their future trend (1995) The Impact of Climate Change on Water Resources in the Northwestern and Northern China (in Chinese), pp. 53-78. , Jinan: Shandong Science and Technology Press; Yao, T., Xie, Z., Wu, X., Climatic Change since Little Ice Age recorded by Dunde Ice Cap (1991) Science in China, Ser.
