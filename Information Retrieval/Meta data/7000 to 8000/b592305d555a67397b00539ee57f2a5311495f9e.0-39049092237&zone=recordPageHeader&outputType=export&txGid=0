Through digital elevation model (DEM) acquired by the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM), the extent and distribution of the high to low-risk coastal plains were identified. The spatio-temporal analysis revealed the inundated coastal areas of 545, 1,286, and 2,125 km2 at average rates of 5, 10, and 15 mm yr-1 for 200 years, respectively. This is equivalent to minimum and maximum land losses by 2205 of 0.1-0.3% of the total area and of 1.3-5.2% of the coastal areas with elevations of less than 100 m in the country, respectively. This study provides an initial assessment of vulnerability to sea-level rise to help decision-makers, and other concerned stakeholders to develop appropriate public policies and land-use planning measures. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Coastal vulnerability; Global climate change; Inundation; Sea-level rise; Turkey","Climate change; Coastal zones; Computer simulation; Environmental impact assessments; Floods; Land use; Risk analysis; Coastal inundation; Digital elevation model; Shuttle radar topography mission; Spatio-temporal analysis; Sea level; climate change; coastal erosion; coastal plain; coastal zone; digital elevation model; land use planning; sea level change; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; vulnerability; article; coastal plain; coastal waters; global change; health care policy; land use; quantitative analysis; sea level rise; topography; Turkey (republic); Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Seawater; Turkey; Eurasia; Turkey",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Clark, P.U., Huybrechts, P., Joughin, I., Ice-sheet and sea-level changes (2005) Science, 310, pp. 456-460; Awosika, L.F., French, G.T., Nichols, R.J., Ibe, C.E., (1992) The Impacts of Sea Level Rise on the Coastline of Nigeria, , Paper presented at the 2002 International Workshop: Global Climate Change and the Rising Challenge of the Sea, Margarita Island, Venezuela, 9-13th March 1992; Cazenave, A., Nerem, R.S., Present-day sea level change: Observations and causes (2004) Reviews of Geophysics, 42, pp. RG3001. , doi: 10.1029/2003RG000139; Cazenave, A., Bonnefond, P., Mercier, F., Dominh, K., Toumazou, V., Sea level variations in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea from satellite altimetry and tide gauges (2002) Global and Planetary Change, 34, pp. 59-86; (2004) Void-filled Seamless SRTM Data V2, , http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org, CGIAR-CSI International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), available from the CGIAR-CSI SRTM 90 m Database at:; Church, J.A., Gregory, J.M., Huybrechts, P., Kuhn, M., Lambeck, K., Nhuan, M.T., Changes in sea level (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , In J.
