Species were identified that are short-range endemics, restricted to isolated populations, restricted to vulnerable habitats, or vulnerable to a rise in sea temperature from global warming. Of the 1650 species assessed, 3.7% were potentially endemic to Victoria, although many of these were known from few records and their described distribution may reflect collection or taxonomic artefacts. More species were restricted to vulnerable habitats: 0.7% to seagrass beds; 3% to embayments; 3.5% to the trawled area of continental shelf off east Gippsland; and 6% to the intertidal/shallow subtidal zone (0-3 m). Up to 14% of species are confined to the cool temperate waters of south-eastern Australia and could become locally extinct within Victoria from a sea temperature rise of 1-2°C. The potential for biodiversity loss from Victorian marine waters is discussed.",,"coastal zone; endemism; extinction risk; rarity; Australia; Echinodermata; Halophila; Mollusca; Victoria",,,,,,"Blom, W.M., Late Quaternary sediments and sea-levels in Bass Basin, southeastern Australia - A preliminary report (1988) Search, 19, pp. 94-96; Borowitzka, M.A., Lethbridge, R.C., Seagrass epiphytes (1989) Biology of Seagrasses: A Treatise on the Biology of Seagrasses with Special Reference to the Australian Region, pp. 458-499. , Eds A.
