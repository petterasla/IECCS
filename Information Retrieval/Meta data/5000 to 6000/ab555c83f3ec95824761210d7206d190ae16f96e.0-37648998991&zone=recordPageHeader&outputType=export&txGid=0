Despite a systematic inventory of these forests, however, estimates of total carbon stocks vary, and spatial variations in the stocks within large aggregated units of land are unknown, thus hampering measurement of sources and sinks of carbon. We mapped the distribution of living forest biomass for the year 2000 by developing a relationship between ground measurements of wood volume at 12 sites throughout the Russian Federation and data from the MODIS satellite bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) product (MOD43B4). Based on the results of regression-tree analyses, we used the MOD43B4 product to assign biomass values to individual 500m × 500m cells in areas identified as forest by two satellite-based maps of land cover. According to the analysis, the total living biomass varied between 46 and 67Pg, largely because of different estimates of forest area. Although optical data are limited in distinguishing differences in biomass in closed canopy forests, the estimates of total living biomass obtained here varied more in response to different definitions of forest than to saturation of the optical sensing of biomass. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biomass; Carbon; Forest inventory; Forests; MODIS; Russia","Biomass; Carbon; Distribution functions; Estimation; Global warming; Radiometers; Satellites; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; Forest inventory; Forests; Ground measurements; MODIS; Russia; Russian federation; Spatial variations; Forestry",,,,,,"Alexeyev, V.A., Birdsey, R.A., (1998) General Technical Report; Alexeyev, V.A., Markov, M.V., Birdsey, R.A., (2004) Statistical Data on Forest Fund of Russia and Changing of Forest Productivity in the Second Half of the XX Century; Apps, M.J., Kurz, W.A., Luxmoore, R.J., Nilsson, L.O., Sedjo, R.A., Schmidt, R., Simpson, S.G., Vinson, T.S., Boreal forests and tundra (1993) Water Air Soil Pollut., 70 (1-4), pp. 39-53; Baccini, A., Friedl, M.A., Woodcock, C.E., Warbington, R., Forest biomass estimation over regional scales using multisource data (2004) Geophys.
