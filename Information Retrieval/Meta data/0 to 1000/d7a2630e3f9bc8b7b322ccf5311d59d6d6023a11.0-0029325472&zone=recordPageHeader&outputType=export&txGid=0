The system is called ""Otohime"". Deep sea water is fed to a coral reef of 100km2 at a feeding rate of 3.1 × 105m3/h, electricity of 25MW is generated, CO2 of 5.8 × 104 t-C/y is fixed, and furthermore global temperature can be reduced by 4 × 10-6°C. © 1995.",,"Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Electric power generation; Global warming; Reefs; Renewable energy resources; Seawater; Coral reef ecosystems; Oceanic high mineral water; Otohime project; Ocean thermal energy conversion",,,,,,,"Komiyama, H.; Department of Chemical System Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku Tokyo, Japan",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
