Changes in the extratropical storm tracks under global warming would impact these transports, the ocean circulation and carbon cycle, and society through changing weather patterns. I show that the southern storm track intensifies in the multimodel mean of simulations of 21st century climate change, and that the seasonal cycle of storm-track intensity increases in amplitude in both hemispheres. I use observations of the presentday seasonal cycle to confirm the relationship between storm-track intensity and the mean available potential energy of the atmosphere, and show how this quantitative relationship can be used to account for much of the varied response in storm-track intensity to global warming, including substantially different responses in simulations with different climate models. The results suggest that storm-track intensity is not related in a simple way to global-mean surface temperature, so that, for example, a stronger southern storm track in response to present-day global warming does not imply it was also stronger in hothouse climates of the past.",,"amplitude modulation; atmosphere; carbon cycle; climate change; conference paper; energy; environmental temperature; extratropical storm track; greenhouse effect; humidity; hurricane; Northern Hemisphere; priority journal; seasonal variation; simulation; Southern Hemisphere; weather; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Cyclonic Storms; Global Warming; Seasons; Weather",,,,,,"Held, I.M., Large-scale dynamics and global warming (1993) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 74, pp. 228-241; Hall, N.M.J., Hoskins, B.J., Valdes, P.J., Senior, C.A., Storm tracks in a high-resolution GCM with doubled carbon dioxide (1994) Q J Roy Meteor Soc, 120, pp. 1209-1230; Geng, Q., Sugi, M., Possible change of extratropical cyclone activity due to enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols-study with a high-resolution AGCM (2003) J Climate, 16, pp. 2262-2274; Caballero, R., Langen, P.L., The dynamic range of poleward energy transport in an atmospheric general circulation model (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, pp. L02705; Bengtsson, L., Hodges, K.I., Roeckner, E., Storm tracks and climate change (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 3518-3543; Lambert, S.J., Fyfe, J.C., Changes in winter cyclone frequencies and strengths simulated in enhanced greenhouse warming experiments: Results from the models participating in the IPCC diagnostic exercise (2006) Clim Dynam, 26, pp. 713-728; Li, C., Battisti, D.S., Reduced atlantic storminess during last glacial maximum: Evidence from a coupled climate model (2008) J Climate, 21, pp. 3561-3579; O'Gorman, P.A., Schneider, T., Energy of midlatitude transient eddies in idealized simulations of changed climates (2008) J Climate, 21, pp. 5797-5806; Russell, J.L., Dixon, K.W., Gnanadesikan, A., Stouffer, R.J., Toggweiler, J.R., The southern hemisphere westerlies in a warming world: Propping open the door to the deep ocean (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 6382-6390; Dorland, C., Tol, R.S.J., Palutikof, J.P., Vulnerability of the Netherlands and Northwest Europe to storm damage under climate change (1999) Climatic Change, 43, pp. 513-535; Leibensperger, E.M., Mickley, L.J., Jacob, D.J., Sensitivity of US air quality to midlatitude cyclone frequency and implications of 1980-2006 climate change (2008) Atmos Chem Phys, 8, pp. 7075-7086; Yin, J.H., A consistent poleward shift of the storm tracks in simulations of 21st century climate (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, pp. L18701; McCabe, G.J., Clark, M.P., Serreze, M.C., Trends in northern hemisphere surface cyclone frequency and intensity (2001) J Climate, 14, pp. 2763-2768; Wang, X.L., Swail, V.R., Zwiers, F.W., Climatology and changes of extratropical cyclone activity: Comparison of ERA-40 with NCEP-NCAR reanalysis for 1958-2001 (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 3145-3166; Lorenz, E.N., Available energy and the maintenance of a moist circulation (1978) Tellus, 30, pp. 15-31; Lorenz, E.N., Numerical evaluation of moist available energy (1979) Tellus, 31, pp. 230-235; Schneider, T., Walker, C.C., Self-organization of atmospheric macroturbulence into critical states of weak nonlinear eddy-eddy interactions (2006) J Atmos Sci, 63, pp. 1569-1586; Schneider, T., Walker, C.C., Scaling laws and regime transitions of macroturbulence in dry atmospheres (2008) J Atmos Sci, 65, pp. 2153-2173; Held, I.M., Soden, B.J., Robust responses of the hydrological cycle to global warming (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 5686-5699; Kanamitsu, M., NCEP-DOE AMIP-II reanalysis R-2 (2002) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 83, pp. 1631-1643; Pauluis, O., Held, I.M., Entropy budget of an atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium.
