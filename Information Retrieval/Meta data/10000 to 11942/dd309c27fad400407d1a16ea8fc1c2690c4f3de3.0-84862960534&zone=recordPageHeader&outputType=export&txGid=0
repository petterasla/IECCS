This paper reports on a study that was performed during 2001-2006, in which the climate change simulations of the coupled global climate model of the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis were downscaled by a regional hydroclimate model of Peninsular Malaysia (RegHCM-PM) to the scale of the subregions and watersheds of Peninsular Malaysia (PM), to assess the effect of future climate change on its water resources. On the basis of the simulations of hydroclimatic conditions during the historical period of 1984-1993 and future periods of 2025-2034 and 2041-2050, this report concludes that the overall mean monthly streamflow is approximately the same during both the future period, and the historical period for most of the watersheds of Peninsular Malaysia, except Kelantan and Pahang. In those two watersheds, a significant increase occurs in the overall mean monthly streamflow during the future period. In the future, high flow conditions will be magnified in the Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Perak River watersheds during the wet months, whereas low monthly flows will be significantly lower in the Selangor and Klang watersheds during the dry months. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Global climate change; Global climate models; Greenhouse effect; Hydrologic regimes; Regional hydroclimate models; Water balances","Climate change impact; Climate change simulations; Climate modeling; Coupled global climate model; Future climate; Future projections; Global climate changes; Global climate model; Global climate models; High flow conditions; Historical periods; Hydroclimatic conditions; Hydrologic regime; Malaysia; Monthly flow; Regional modeling; River watersheds; Water balances; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Earth (planet); Greenhouse effect; Landforms; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; Climate models; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; global change; greenhouse effect; hydrological regime; modeling; streamflow; water budget; watershed; Malaysia",,,,,,"Baldwin, M., Kellogg, C.E., Thorp, J., Soil classification (1938), pp. 979-1001. , Soils and men: Yearbook of agriculture 1938, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC(2003) FAO Soil map of the World, , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)Rome; Flato, G.M., The Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis global coupled model and its climate (2000) Climate Dynamics, 16 (6), pp. 451-467. , CLDYEM, 0930-7575, 10.1007/s003820050339; Grell, G., Dudhia, J., Stauffer, D., A description of the fifth-generation Penn State/NCAR mesoscale model (MM5) (1994), NCAR Technical Note NCAR/TN-398+STR, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, COHogg, R., Craig, A.L., (1970) Introduction to mathematical statistics, p. 195. , Macmillan, Upper Saddle River, NJ; (1992) Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, p. 198. , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), J.
