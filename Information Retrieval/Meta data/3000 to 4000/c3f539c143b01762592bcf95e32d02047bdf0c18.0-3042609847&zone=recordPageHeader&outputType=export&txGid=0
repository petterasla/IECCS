We analyse the response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide content in 18 climate models involved in the CMIP program. It is shown that of vital importance in the total response is its radiative component. Moreover, a significant contribution is made by a dynamical response whose main component is the Arctic Oscillation. We describe the method of calculating the operator of the dynamical response of climate models and the real climate system to these external forcings (the calculation of the first moment perturbation). It is shown that the approximate response operator allows one to reproduce both the value and the spatial structure of the linear part of the response of the atmospheric general circulation model with high accuracy. The external forcing optimally exciting the Arctic Oscillation is constructed by the observational data and the results of modelling. It is shown that the radiative response of climate models to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide content is mainly due to an amount of heat used for warming up the ocean and the extent to which the radiation balance of the Earth varies due to cloudiness change as the climate changes. In models predicting the large value of the global warming the short-wave radiation balance on the surface generally increases, whereas the small value of the global warming corresponds to the decrease of the short-wave radiation balance. We discuss the dependence of the value of the global warming, as the carbon dioxide content increases, on the geographical distribution of the incoming short-wave radiation as well as the correction of a heat flux when modelling the present-day climate. Using this dependence, we estimate the expected value of the global warming, as the carbon dioxide content increases, for the real climate system.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer simulation; Global warming; Mathematical models; Oscillations; Climate system response; First moment perturbation; Geographical distribution; Weather forecasting",,,,,,"Alexeev, V.A., Volodin, E.M., Galin, V.Ya., Dymnikov, V.P., Lykossov, V.N., (1998) Modelling of the Present-day Climateby the Atmospheric Model of INM RAS 'DNM GCM'.
