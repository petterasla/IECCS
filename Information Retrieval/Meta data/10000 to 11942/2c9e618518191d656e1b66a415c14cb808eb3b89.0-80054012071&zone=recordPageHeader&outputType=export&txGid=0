The GHG emission accounting practices examined included fuel provision upstream of a material recovery facility (MRF), operational activities at the MRF, and downstream processes. The latter means recycling of waste compared to primary production using virgin materials, or the incineration of waste with energy recovery compared to heating based on the average energy mix for both EU and Norway. The results show that the operational activities at the MRF cause more GHG emissions than the provision of fuel upstream of the MRF (116 vs. 16-21tonnesCO2-eq., respectively). Furthermore, the downstream activities provided far greater avoidance of GHG emissions than the load caused by upstream activities and the activities at the MRF. Recycling proves to be beneficial over incineration of waste when compared to the EU energy mix (savings of -257tonnesCO2-eq.), and the advantage is even larger when compared to the average energy mix for Norway (savings of -779tonnesCO2-eq.). In conclusion, the results show that sorting of mixed waste at military camp collection sites followed by recycling of the separated fractions at MRF would result in significant avoidance of GHG emissions, compared to the current practice of incineration with energy recovery of the mixed waste. © The Author(s) 2011.","energy recovery; environmental management information system; global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions; recycling; waste management","Accounting practices; Alternative approach; Armed forces; Average energy; Downstream process; Energy mix; Energy recovery; GHG emission; Material recovery facilities; Mixed wastes; Operational activity; Primary production; Virgin materials; Waste management practices; Energy conversion; Environmental management; Facilities; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Knowledge management; Recovery; Recycling; Waste incineration; Waste management; carbon dioxide; fuel; armed forces; emission control; emission inventory; energy conservation; environmental management; fuel consumption; global warming; greenhouse gas; heating; incineration; information system; military land; recycling; waste management; army; article; data base; energy; environmental management; greenhouse effect; heating; incineration; methodology; Norway; priority journal; recycling; solid waste management; waste; waste management; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Military Personnel; Norway; Recycling; Waste Management; Norway",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Astrup, T., Fruergaard, T., Christensen, T.H., Recycling of plastic: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions (2009) Waste Management and Research, 27, pp. 763-772; Astrup, T., Moller, J., Fruergaard, T., Incineration and co-combustion of waste: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions (2009) Waste Management and Research, 27, pp. 789-799; (2008) Literature Analysis-How Much GHG Is Avoided by the Recycling of Different Fractions in Waste Management Systems?, pp. 1-121. , Ivry-Sur-Seine, France: Bio Intelligence Service;; Christiansen, M., Ringnes, H., Longva, K.S., (2005) Forsvarets Miljøregnskap for 2004, , http://rapporter.ffi.no/rapporter/2005/04023.pdf, [Environmental Reporting in the Norwegian Armed Forces for 2004] Norwegian Defence Research Establishment report 2005/04023, Kjeller, Norway Retrieved from accessed June 2011; Christiansen, M., Reistad, T., Isdal, T., Longva, K.S., (2006) Forsvarets Miljøregnskap for 2006, , http://rapporter.ffi.no/rapporter/2007/01349.pdf, [Environmental reporting in the Norwegian Armed Forces for 2006] Norwegian Defence Research Establishment report 2006/01349, Kjeller, Norway.
