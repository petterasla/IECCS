We tested whether elevational ranges of montane butterflies conform to Rapoport's elevational rule (species at higher elevations have greater elevational ranges). We also tested whether the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis (emigrants from higher elevation populations inflate the species richness of lower-elevation sites) could explain the species richness patterns we observed. In addition, we predicted whether global climate change is likely to perturb current elevational gradients in butterfly species richness. Species presence data were collected from 105 100-m vertical elevational bands in 17 canyons. Elevation and species richness were significantly negatively correlated, although species richness peaked at intermediate elevations, and butterflies in species-rich areas had significantly narrower elevational ranges than species in more depauperate areas. Toiyabe Range butterflies conformed to Rapoport's elevational rule. The Rapoport effect we documented did not result from sampling bias. However, the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis cannot fully explain the elevational gradient in species richness. Environmental severity at either end and favorable conditions near the middle of the elevational gradient likely contributed to high species richness at intermediate elevations. Our models indicated that few butterfly taxa will be lost from the Toiyabe Range in the face of climate change. To maintain present species richness and maximize the potential of Great Basin butterflies to adapt to rapid climate change, we recommend that habitat protection and restoration efforts target not only high elevation Wilderness Areas but also intermediate elevations.","Butterflies; Climate change; Ecosystem management; Elevation; Great Basin; Nestedness; Rapoport's rule","butterfly; community structure; elevation; environmental gradient; Rapoport Rule; United States; Lepidoptera",,,,,,"Arms, K., Feeney, P., Lederhouse, R.C., Sodium: Stimulus for puddling behavior by tiger swallowtail butterflies (1974) Science, 185, pp. 372-374; Austin, G.T., Murphy, D.D., Zoogeography of Great Basin butterflies: Patterns of distribution and differentiation (1987) Great Basin Naturalist, 47, pp. 186-201; Baz, A., Abundancia y riqueza de las comunidades forestales de mariposas Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera y su relación con la altitud en el sisicma Ibérico meridional (1987) Graellsia, 43, pp. 179-192; Boggs, C.L., Murphy, D.D., Community composition in mountain ecosystems: Climatic determinants of montane butterfly distributions (1997) Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters, 6, pp. 39-48; Bohn, B., A brief overview of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (1996) United Nations Climate Change Bulletin, 10. , second quarter; Britten, H.B., Brussard, P.F., Murphy, D.D., The pending extinction of the Uncompahgre tritillary butterfly (1994) Conservation Biology, 8, pp. 86-94; Brown, J., The theory of insular biogeography and the distribution of boreal mammals and birds (1978) Great Basin Naturalist Memoirs, 2, pp. 209-228; Myers, A.A., Gilier, P.S., Species diversity (1988) Analytical Biogeography: An Integrated Approach to the Study of Animal and Plant Distributions, pp. 57-89. , Chapman and Hall, London, UK; Brown, J.H., Kodric-Brown, A., Turnover rates in insular biogeography: Effects of immigration on extinction (1977) Ecology, 58, pp. 445-449; Brunner, R.D., Clark, T.W., A practice-based approach to ecosystem management (1997) Conservation Biology, 11, pp. 48-58; Charlet, D.A., (1996) Atlas of Nevada Conifers, , University of Nevada Press, Reno, Nevada, USA; Clench, H.K., How to make regional lists of butterflies: Some thoughts (1979) Journal of the Lepidoptcrists' Society, 33, pp. 216-231; Colwell, R.K., Hurtt, G.C., Nonbiological gradients in species richness and a spurious Rapoport effect (1994) American Naturalist, 144, pp. 570-595; Dennis, R.L.H., (1993) Butterflies and Climate Change, , Manchester University Press.
