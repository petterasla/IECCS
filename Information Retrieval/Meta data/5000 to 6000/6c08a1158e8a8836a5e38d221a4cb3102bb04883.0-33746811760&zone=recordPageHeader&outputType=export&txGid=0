The results show that the vegetation biomass and the energy use efficiency of photosynthesis are especially sensitive to the annual precipitation; strong and complex interactions exist between the vegetation and the atmosphere on multiple scales leading to supernormal thermal heterogeneity of the underlying surface, the strong vortex movement and turbulence. This study can facilitate understanding of the land surface processes and the influences of global climate change as well as human activities on the human environment in the arid and semi-arid zones. It also aids in improving the parameterization schemes of turbulent fluxes of a heterogeneous underlying surface for land surface processes in climate models.","Arid zone; Climate; Climate change; Ecosystem; Precipitation",,,,,,,"Anderson, C.J., Hydrological processes in regional climate model simulations of the central United States flood of June-July (2003) Journal of Hydrometeor, 4, pp. 584-598. , Coauthors; (1993) Biosphere Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle (BAHC), , BAHC Core Project Office, Report No.27, International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme; Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Lee, S.E., Woodwards, F.I., Contrasting physiological and structural vegetation feedback in climate change simulations (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 796-799; Bonan, G.B., Pollard, D., Thompson, S.L., A land surface model for ecological (1996) Hydrological and Atmospheric Studies, p. 150. , NCAR Technical Note, NCAR/TN-417+STR; Bonan, G.B., Pollard, D., Thompson, S.L., Effects of boreal forest vegetation on global climate (1992) Nature, 359, pp. 716-718; Brovkin, V., Claussen, M., Petoukhov, V., Ganopolski, A., On the stability of the atmosphere-vegetation system in the Sahara/Sahel region (1998) J.
