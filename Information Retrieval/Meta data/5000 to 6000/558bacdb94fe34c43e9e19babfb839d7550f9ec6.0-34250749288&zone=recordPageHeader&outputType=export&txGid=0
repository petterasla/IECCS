Environmental burdens associated with these elements are analyzed in terms of embodied energy along with the environmental impacts such as global warming, acidification and nutrient enrichment. Economic analysis based on market prices of materials and social analysis based on interviews are also carried out. It was found that asbestos elements are superior to tile elements for environmental scores acidification, nutrient enrichment and embodied energies. However, the global warming of the asbestos elements is a little higher. On economic and social scores also asbestos elements perform better. This analysis will help in the decision-making process when selecting materials for these elements. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
