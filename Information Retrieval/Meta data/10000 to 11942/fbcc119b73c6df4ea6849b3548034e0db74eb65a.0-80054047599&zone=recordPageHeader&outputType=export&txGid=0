The cosmic ray intensity shows a strong 11 year cycle due to solar modulation and the overall rate has decreased since 1900. These changes in cosmic ray intensity are compared to those of the mean global surface temperature to attempt to quantify any link between the two. It is shown that, if such a link exists, the changing cosmic ray intensity contributes less than 8% to the increase in the mean global surface temperature observed since 1900. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate; Cosmic rays; Global warming","Climate; Cosmic ray intensity; Global surface temperature; Overall rate; Solar modulation; Atmospheric temperature; Cosmic rays; Global warming; Surface properties; Cosmology",,,,,,"Brohan, P., Kennedy, J.J., Harris, I., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, P.D., Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: a new dataset from 1850 (2006) J.
