However, new sources, not existing sources, will be primarily responsible for global CO2 emissions in the 21st century, since new sources provide for growth and replace existing sources at the end of their useful lives. Hence, policy initiatives should be designed for new sources rather than for existing sources, and cap and trade may not be the best approach. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
