We present results from five pairs of 100-year (timeslice) simulations - control and 2 × CO<inf>2</inf> - carried out with the coupled chemistry-climate model IGCM-FASTOC, in which land and/or sea surface temperatures are either calculated interactively, prescribed and interannually varying, or prescribed with a climatological seasonal cycle. The strongest response to CO<inf>2</inf>-doubling in the Northern Hemisphere high-latitude winter stratosphere is found when surface temperatures are calculated interactively by a coupled slab ocean and a land surface scheme. Both the interannual variability in ocean and land temperatures, and the adjustment of oceans and lands to the atmosphere and to one another, are important in order to maintain realistic stratospheric forcing by planetary waves and to adequately capture the stratospheric response to global warming. © 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"Climate models; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Surface properties; Surface waters; Upper atmosphere; Atmospheric greenhouse; Coupled chemistry-climate model; Gas concentration; Interannual variability; Land surface scheme; Northern Hemispheres; Ocean surface temperature; Planetary Waves; Polar vortex; Sea surface temperatures; Seasonal cycle; Slab ocean; Surface temperatures; Time-scales; Timeslice; Atmospheric temperature; air-sea interaction; annual variation; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; climatology; concentration (composition); global warming; greenhouse gas; latitude; Northern Hemisphere; numerical model; planetary wave; polar region; sea surface temperature; stratosphere; temperature profile; timescale; vortex",,,,,,"Bourqui, M.S., Taylor, C.P., Shine, K.P., A new fast stratospheric ozone chemistry scheme in an intermediate general-circulation model.
