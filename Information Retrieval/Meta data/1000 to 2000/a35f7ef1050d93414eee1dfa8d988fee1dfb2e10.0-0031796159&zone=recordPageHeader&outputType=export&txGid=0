We used a physically based scenario of asymmetric warming combined with climate change scenarios from General Circulation Models (GCMs) outputs and the EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) plant process model to examine the effects of asymmetric temperature change on crop productivity. Our results indicated that the potential effects of global change on crop productivity may be less severe with asymmetric day-night warming than with equal day-night warming.",,"climate change; crop production; diurnal variation; global warming; warming",,,,,,"Allen Jr., L.H., Plant Responses to Rising Carbon Dioxide and Potential Interactions with Air Pollutants (1990) J.
