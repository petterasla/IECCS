Available water in the basin is limited and intensely managed. Cottonwood Creek and Bridgeport Creek drain the northern non-Sierra portion of the Mono Basin, and while these watersheds contribute relatively little of the total runoff into Mono Lake, their hydroclimatic conditions are representative of the majority of the Mono Basin drainage area. The hydrologic balance for these watersheds is modeled and selected climate change scenarios are simulated to determine the magnitude of change in water surplus resulting from altered temperature of ±1° and ±2° C and precipitation changes of ±10% and ±20%. Changes in modeled water surplus expressed as a percentage of existing conditions range between 154% and 35% for Cottonwood Creek and 174% and 20% for Bridgeport Creek. Both watersheds display a greater response to a given change in precipitation than to a change in temperature. Bridgeport Creek is more sensitive than Cottonwood Creek to both precipitation and temperature change, owing to its more arid baseline conditions and lower elevation. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Chang, L.H., Hunsaker, C.T., Draves, J.D., Recent research on effects of climate change on water resources (1992) Water Resources Bulletin, 28, pp. 273-286; Flaschka, I., Stockton, C.W., Boggess, W.R., Climatic variation and surface water resources in the Great Basin region (1987) Water Resources Bulletin, 23, pp. 47-57; Glancey, P.A., (1971) Water Resources Appraisal of Antelope Valley and East Walker Area, Nevada and California, p. 53. , Carson City, NV: Nevada Division of Water Resources, Water Resources-Reconnaissance Series Report; Gleick, P.H., Global climate changes and regional hydrology: Impacts and responses (1987) The Influence of Climate Change and Climatic Variability on the Hydrologic Regime and Water Resources, 168, pp. 389-402. , S.l.
