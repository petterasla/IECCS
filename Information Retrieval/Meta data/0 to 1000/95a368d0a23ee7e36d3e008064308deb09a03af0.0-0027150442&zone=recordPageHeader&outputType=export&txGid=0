The prospects for improving conventional vehicles in these areas by the year 2000 are considered. Alternative engines and fuels are reviewed for the same time-frame. The status of the battery-electric vehicle is assessed. Shifting attention to the mid-21st century, the possibility of global warming is chanelling thought toward non-fossil fuels, with hydrogen being added to the list of options.",,"Air pollution control; Alternative fuels; Electric vehicles; Environmental protection; Fuel economy; Particulate emissions; Synthetic fuels; Alternative engines; Vehicle emissions; Passenger cars",,,,,,,"Amann, C.A.; General Motors Research Lab, Warren, United States",,,,,,,,01433369,,IJVDD,,"English","Int J Veh Des",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027150442
