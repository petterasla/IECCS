The model experiments utilize a methodology, which is suggested by an exploration of the uncertainties associated with a regional model forced by global climate model output. The results are based primarily on an analysis of the output of three model runs. In the first, we prescribe modern land cover and irrigation conditions and force the model with recent meteorological conditions. In the second, we prescribe an historical land cover without irrigation and force with past conditions, derived from a global coupled climate model. In the third, we prescribe the historical land cover without irrigation, but force with the recent conditions. The model results show that global warming has a large effect on precipitation, snow water, surface temperature, low level winds and soil moisture They also show in summer that irrigation has a strong effect on the differences between recent and past conditions in maximum temperature, surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, surface moisture, and surface humidity. The primary uncertainty associated with these conclusions is related to the use of boundary forcing from a single global climate model.
