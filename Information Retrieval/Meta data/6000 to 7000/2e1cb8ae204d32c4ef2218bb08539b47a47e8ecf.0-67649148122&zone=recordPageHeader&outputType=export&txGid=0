In order to successfully address deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, a compensation scheme must include the main actors involved in deforestation and provide incentives for forest stewards who protect forest carbon stores. Since each tropical forest country represents a different mix of public and private tenure of forested land, policies at the UNFCCC level will need to be sufficiently flexible to allow countries to tailor REDD programs to reflect these differences. At the same time, Parties need to negotiate a basic REDD structure that can apply to all countries as a framework under which to build their national programs. We propose an approach that will incorporate the three main actors of deforestation and forest protection in tropical regions: government, private forest owners, and public forest stewards (including indigenous people and others). These funds and the activities supported by them are envisoned to function most effectively under a combined market and non-market approach.","Deforestation; Degradation; Forest stewards; Land tenure; Market","climate change; conference proceeding; deforestation; developing world; environmental degradation; environmental protection; forest management; forestry policy; global change; international agreement; land tenure; negotiation process; tropical forest; United Nations",,,,,,"ASNER, G.P., KNAPP, D.E., BROADBENT, E.N., OLIVEIRA, P.J.C., KELLER, M., SILVA, J.N., Selective logging in the Brazilian Amazon (2005) Science, 310 (5747), pp. 480-482; KELLNDORFER, J., SHIMADA, M., ROSENQVIST, A., WALKER, W., KIRSCH, K., NEPSTAD, D., LAPORTE, N., LEFEBVRE, P., New Eyes in the Sky: Cloud-Free Tropical Forest Monitoring for REDD with the Japanese Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) (2007) WHRC Research Report, , www.whrc.org)http://whrc.org/policy/BaliReports/assets/BaliALOS.pdf; LAPORTE, N., MERRY, F., BACCINI, A., GOETZ, S., STABACH, J., BOWMAN, M., (2007) Reducing CO2 Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in the Democratic Republic of Congo: A First Look, , www.whrc.org, WHRC Research Report. 32 pp; Tropical deforestation and climate change, , MOUTINHO, P, and SCHWARTZMAN, S. 2005, Eds, Environmental Defense Fund, Washington, DC; NEPSTAD, D.C., SCHWARTZMANN, S., BAMBERGER, B., SANTILLI, M., RAY, D., SCHLESINGER, P., LEFEBVRE, P., ROLLA, A., Inhibition of Amazon deforestation and fi re by parks and indigenous lands (2006) Conservation Biology, 20 (1), pp. 65-73; NEPSTAD, D., SOARES, B., MERRY, F., MOUTINHO, P., OLIVEIRA RODRIGUES, H., SCHWARTZMAN, S., ALMEIDA, O., RIVERO, S. and BOWMAN, M. 2007.
