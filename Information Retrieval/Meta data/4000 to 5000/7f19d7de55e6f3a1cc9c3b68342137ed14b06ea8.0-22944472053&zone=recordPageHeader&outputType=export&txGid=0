Modelled temperature changes show close agreement with ground surface temperature histories from elsewhere in the world for this period and indicate that the Blackwood Plateau has experienced a 0.4 K increase in mean temperature between the beginning of the sixteenth century and the 1980s, with more than half of the increase having taken place after 1900. The modelling indicates that the highest temperatures in the region for the last 500 years were recorded during the twentieth century, and that the current rate of temperature change of more than 0.5° K per century is higher than at any other time during this time period. © Geological Society of Australia.","Borehole temperatures; Climate proxies; Global warming; Holocene; Western Australia","Holocene; paleoclimate; Australasia; Australia; Eastern Hemisphere; World",,,,,,"Allan, R., Hunt, B., Climate change modelling for the southern region of Western Australia (1999) CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research Report, , http://www.dar.csiro.au/publications/allan_1999a.pdf, (also at); Appleyard, S.J., The geology and hydrogeology of the Cowaramup borehole line, Perth Basin, Western Australia (1991) Geological Survey of Western Australia Report, 30, pp. 1-12; Backhouse, J., Holocene vegetation and climate record from Barker Swamp, Rottnest Island, Western Australia (1993) Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia, 76, pp. 53-71; Beltrami, H., Climate from borehole data: Energy fluxes and temperatures since 1500 (2002) Geophysical Research Letters, 29, pp. 2111-2114; Beltrami, H., Gosselin, C., Mareschal, J.C., Ground surface temperatures in Canada: Spatial and temporal variability (2003) Geophysical Research Letters, 30, pp. 1499-1502; Bestow, T.T., The geothermal energy development potential of large basins in Western Australia (1990) Proceedings of the International Conference on Groundwater in Large Sedimentary Basins, 20, pp. 319-329. , Perth, Western Australia, Australian Water Resource Council Conference Series; Carslaw, H.S., Jaeger, J.C., (1959) Conduction of Heat in Solids, , (2nd edition).
