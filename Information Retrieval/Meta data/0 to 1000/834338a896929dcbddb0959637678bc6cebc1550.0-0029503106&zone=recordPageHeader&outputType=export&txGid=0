Apart from an upward trend since 1975, to which El Niño has contributed, the amplitude time series associated with this pattern resembles seasonally dependent white noise. It is argued that the variability associated with this pattern is dynamically induced and is not necessarily an integral part of the fingerprint of global warming.",,"atmospheric dyamics; mean temperature trend; temperature fluctutation",,,,,,"Jones, P.D., (1986) J.
