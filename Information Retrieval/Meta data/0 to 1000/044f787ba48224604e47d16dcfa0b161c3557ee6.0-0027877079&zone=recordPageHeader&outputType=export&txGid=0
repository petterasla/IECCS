The measured activation energies (2-3 kcal mol-1) are consistent with a mechanism of H atom abstraction. The tropospheric lifetimes, estimated from the measured OH reaction rates, and measured integrated infrared absorption cross sections over the range 770 to 1430 cm-1 suggest that E 134 and FC 236fa may have significant global warming potential, while FC 236ea and FC 236cb do not. -from Authors",,"chlorofluorocarbon replacement; hydroxyl radical; infrared absorption spectra; rate constant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027877079
