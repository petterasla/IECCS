Ninety-one percent of the species showed a significant advance in FAD over this period, with the mean advance being 11.6 days/century. Using truncations of the full data-set corresponding to available data for changes in observer effort and population trends, we found that adding these ancillary independent variables to a multiple linear regression contributed little to explain the change in FAD in recent years. The advance in FAD is potentially an index of global climate change in this region.",,"Aves",,,,,,"Bauer, S., Gienapp, P., Madsen, J., The relevance of environmental conditions for departure decision changes en route in migrating geese (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 1953-1960; Betts, M.G., Rodenhouse, N., Sillett, T.S., Doran, P.J., Holmes, R.T., Dynamic occupancy models reveal within-breeding season movement up a habitat quality gradient by a migratory songbird (2008) Ecography, 31, pp. 592-600; Both, C., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.E., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Butler, C.J., The disproportionate effect of global warming on the arrival dates of short-distance migratory birds in North America (2003) Ibis, 145 (3), pp. 484-495. , DOI 10.1046/j.1474-919X.2003.00193.x; (2008) All about Birds, , http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds, Cornell University Lab of Ornithology Accessed 22 July 2008; Deorsey, S., Butler, B., (2006) The Birds of Dutchess County New York, p. 274. , Grinnell and Lawton Publishing, Millbrook, NY; Dunn, P.O., Winkler, D.W., Climate change has affected the breeding date of tree swallows throughout North America (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 266 (1437), pp. 2487-2490; Ledneva, A., Miller-Rushing, A.J., Primack, R.B., Imbres, C., Climate change as reflected in a naturalist's diary, Middleborough, Massachusetts (2004) Wilson Bulletin, 116 (3), pp. 224-231; Marra, P.P., Francis, C.M., Mulvihill, R.S., Moore, F.R., The influence of climate on the timing and rate of spring bird migration (2005) Oecologia, 142 (2), pp. 307-315. , DOI 10.1007/s00442-004-1725-x; Miller-Rushing, A.J., Lloyd-Evans, T.L., Primack, R.B., Satzinger, P., Bird migration times, climate change, and changing population sizes (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 1959-1972; Miller-Rushing, A.J., Primack, R.B., Stymeist, R., Interpreting variation in bird migration times as observed by volunteers (2008) Auk, 125, pp. 565-573; Møller, A.P., Rubolini, D., Lehikoinen, E., Populations of migratory bird species that did not show a phenological response to climate change are declining (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 42, pp. 16195-16200; (2006) Poughkeepsie Temperature Records, , http://neisa.unh.edu/climate/PoughkeepsieNY-Temperature.html, New England Integrated Sciences and Assessment (NEISA) Accessed July 2011; (2009) The State of the Birds, United States of America, 2009, p. 36. , North American Bird Conservation Initiative, US Committee (NABCI) US Department of the Interior, Washington, DC; Root, T.L., Price, J.T., Hall, K.R., Schneider, S.H., Rosenzweig, C., Pounds, J.A., Fingerprints of global warming on wild animals and plants (2003) Nature, 421 (6918), pp. 57-60. , DOI 10.1038/nature01333; Sauer, J.R., Hines, J.E., Fallown, J., (2007) The North American Breeding Bird Survey, Results and Analysis 1966-2006, , www.mbrpwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/bbs.html, Version 10.13.200., USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, MD Accessed 15 August 2008; Snedecor, G.W., Cochran, W.G., (1967) Statistical Methods.
