Carbon-sequestering forest activities may be one of the least expensive approaches to mitigate the build up of atmospheric CO2. However, the fact that forest management practices are species-, site-and management-objective-specific increases the complexity of using the forestry sector to mitigate global warming. In order to provide useful and timely information concerning carbon sequestration, this study investigated three forestry-based opportunities for sequestering carbon in the United States: conversion of marginal agricultural land to forests and reforestation of poorly stocked pine plantations in the South, afforestation of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), and reclamation and afforestation of abandoned mined lands (AML). This study conducted economic analyses on three region-species combinations: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) in the southern states, cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) in the LMAV, and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) on AML in West Virginia. The objectives of this study were to determine the profitability of managing these three commercial tree species for timber production only and for the combination of timber production and carbon sequestration and then calculate net tonnes of carbon stored during one rotation and net revenues generated from each tonne of carbon sequestered. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","Abandoned mined lands; Carbon credit market; Carbon sequestration; Economics; Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley; Southern states","Abandoned mines; Carbon dioxide; Chelation; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Global warming; Abondoned mined lands; Carbon credit market; Carbon sequestration; Lower Mississipi Alluvial Valley; Southern states; Forestry; carbon; carbon sequestration; economic analysis; environmental economics; forestry production; agricultural management; article; atmospheric deposition; calculation; carbon sequestration; climate change; concentration response; economic evaluation; forest; forest management; greenhouse effect; oak; pine; plantation; rotation; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Chelation; Climates; Economic Analysis; Emission; Forestry; North America; United States; Pinus taeda; Quercus lobata; Quercus pagoda; Quercus rubra",,"carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Adams, D.M., Alig, R.J., McCarl, B.M., Callaway, J.M., Winnett, S.M., Minimum cost strategies for sequestering carbon in forests (1999) Land Economics, 75 (3), pp. 360-374; Adams, D.M., Haynes, R.W., (1996) The 1993 Timber Assessment Market Model: Structure, Projections and Policy Simulations, 59p. , General Technical Report PNW- GTR-368.
