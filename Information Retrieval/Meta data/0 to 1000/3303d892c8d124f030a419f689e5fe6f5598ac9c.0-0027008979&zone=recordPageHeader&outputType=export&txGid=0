Sediments from the George V Coast continental margin potentially contain a high resolution record of the late Holocene. The relatively high rate of sedimentation (∼ 3 mm/year) and the presence of laminated intervals which contain undisturbed sequences make these sediments valuable for future downcore work. In order to utilize diatom assemblages as proxies of paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic parameters, a preliminary study of the surface sediment distribution of diatoms from the George V Coast continental margin was completed. Nitzschia curta (Van Heurck) Hasle and Nitzschia kerguelensis (O'Meara) Hasle present great potential for tracking the Holocene retreat of ice across the continental shelf of this region. Concentrations of N. curta, an ""ice-related"" form, decreases in an offshore direction, whereas N. kerguelensis, an ""oceanic"" species associated with circumpolar flow, displays an increase in sediments offshore. The genus Thalassiosira Cleve displays a clear association with areas of open water primary production, as has been noted in others parts of the Antarctic. Downcore variability in relative abundance of this genus will be useful in understanding the history of sea ice versus open water production on the George V Coast shelf. In contrast, the distribution of Chaetoceros Ehrenberg resting spores appears to be more complex, but may be related to the position of the stationary ice edge associated with the annual minimal extent of sea ice. Finally, an understanding of the downcore variability of Thalassiothrix antarctica Schimper ex Karsten, a species which is very abundant in the laminated sections of the sediment cores, will have to rely on studies of its distribution in other areas of the Antarctic, as it is sparsely distributed along the George V Coast today. © 1992.",,"climate; diatom; distribution; environmental indicator; Holocene; palaeoceanography; surface sediment; Chaetoceros; Nitzschia; palaeoclimate; palaeoenvironment; sediment; Thalassiosira; Southern Ocean, George V Shelf; Antarctica, George V Coast; Bacillariophyta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chaetoceros; Meara; Nitzschia; Nitzschia kerguelensis; Thalassiosira",,,,,,"Anderson, Balshaw, Domack, Kurtz, Milam, Wright, The scientific programe: USCGC Glacier Deep Freeze 79 Expedition (1979) Antarct.
