In particular, it is difficult to distinguish anthropogenic factors from long-term natural fluctuations. An important source of evidence lies in past recordings of temperature, but the evaluation of these rests on their reliability, which is very variable. This article reviews the accuracy of past records in respect of the instruments, their exposure, and the observers. © 1992.",,,,,,,,"Knowles Middleton, (1966) A history of the thermometer and its use in meteorology, , Johns Hopkins Press; (1877) Q.J.
