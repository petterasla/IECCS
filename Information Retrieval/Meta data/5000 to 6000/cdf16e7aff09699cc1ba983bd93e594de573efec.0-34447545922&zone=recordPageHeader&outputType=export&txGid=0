A major challenge to ecologists and marine resource managers is to understand and predict how these global changes will affect species and ecosystems at local scales where temperature more directly affects biological responses and species interactions. Here, we investigate historical variability in regional sea surface temperature in two large heavily exploited marine ecosystems and compare these variations with expected rates of temperature change for the 21st century. We use four of the world's longest calibrated daily time series to show that trends in surface temperatures in the North and Baltic Seas now exceed those at any time since instrumented measurements began in 1861 and 1880. Temperatures in summer since 1985 have increased at nearly triple the global warming rate, which is expected to occur during the 21st century and summer temperatures have risen two to five times faster than those in other seasons. These warm temperatures and rates of change are due partly to an increase in the frequency of extremely warm years. The recent warming event is exceeding the ability of local species to adapt and is consequently leading to major changes in the structure, function and services of these ecosystems. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Baltic Sea; Climate change; North Sea; Surface temperature; Warming","climate change; climate effect; ecosystem response; global change; global warming; marine ecosystem; time series analysis; trend analysis; water temperature; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; North Sea",,,,,,"Barnett, T.P., Pierce, D.W., AchutaRao, K.M., Gleckler, P.J., Santer, B.D., Gregory, J.M., Washington, W.M., Penetration of human-induced warming into the world's oceans (2005) Science, 309, pp. 284-287; Beare, D.J., Burns, F., Greig, T., Jones, E.C., Peach, K., Keinzle, M., Mckenzie, E., Reid, D.G., Long-term increases in prevalence of North Sea fishes having southern biogeographic affinities (2004) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 284, pp. 269-278; Beaugrand, G., Brander, K.M., Lindley, J.A., Souissi, S., Reid, P.C., Plankton effect on cod recruitment in the North Sea (2004) Nature, 426, pp. 661-664; Beaugrand, G., Reid, P.C., Ibañez, F., Lindley, J.A., Edwards, M., Reorganization of North Atlantic marine copepod biodiversity and climate (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1692-1694; Becker, G., Kohnke, D., Long-term variations of temperature and salinity in the inner German Bight (1978) Rapports Et Proces-verbaux De La Réunion Du Conseil Internationale Pour L'Exploration De La Mer, 172, pp. 335-344; Begg, G.A., Marteinsdottir, G., Environmental and stock effects on spatial distribution and abundance of mature cod Gadus morhua (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 229, pp. 245-262; Brander, K.M., Blom, G., Borges, M.F., Changes in fish distribution in the eastern North Atlantic: Are we seeing a coherent response to changing temperature?
