The results showed that the amount of energy consumed in irrigated wheat production was 13,205.90 MJ ha-1 and in rainfed wheat production was 14,134.93 MJ ha-1. In the surveyed farm holdings, the energy input-output ratio for the irrigated wheat was 3.80, while benefit-cost ratio was 0.81. The productivity of irrigated wheat was calculated to be 3.67. The energy input-output ratio for rainfed wheat was 2.51, while the benefit-cost ratio was 0.53. The productivity of rainfed wheat was calculated to be 2.43. About 77% of the total energy inputs used in irrigated wheat production were non-renewable, while only about 23% was renewable. The total energy input used in rainfed wheat production was non-renewable 75% and 25% renewable energy. This study suggested that diesel-oil and fertilizers were not efficiently used. Intensive input use in irrigated wheat and rainfed wheat raises some problems like environmental pollution and global warming.","Economic analysis; Fertilizer; Input-output energy; Productivity; Wheat","fertilizer; article; cost benefit analysis; economics; energy consumption; grain yield; greenhouse effect; irrigation (agriculture); renewable energy; Turkey (republic); wheat; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"(2005), http://www.dtm.gov.tr, Undersecretariat of the Prime Ministry for Foreign TradeGül, U. 2004.
