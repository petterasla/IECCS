To predict the response of forests to global change, it is necessary to construct functional models of forest tree populations. The size-structure-based model requires far less memory and steps of calculation compared with individual-based models, and it is easy to incorporate the dimension of geographic locations into the model to describe large-scale dynamics of forest-type distributions. The effect of increasing size growth rate, expected from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, was diminished at the stand-level basal area density, because of regulation by one-sided competition. Model simulations of a century-long global warming at around 3 °C predicted that (1) biomass changed in resident forests rather simultaneously in response to warming, and that (2) there was a considerable time lag in movement at the boundaries of different forest types, particularly under the existence of resident forest types that would be finally replaced. It required several thousand years after a century-long warming spell for forest types to attain new steady-state distributions after shifting. As a consequence, global warming created a zigzag pattern of biomass distribution along a latitudinal gradient, i.e., an increase in the cooler-side boundary of forest types and a decrease in the warmer-side boundary. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Forest zone; Global change; Latitudinal gradient; One-sided competition; Seed dispersal; Simulation; Size structure",,,,,,,"Ada, J.M., Woodward, F.I., The past as a key to the future: the use of palaeoenvironmental understanding to predict the effects of man on the biosphere (1992) Advances in Ecological Research, 22, pp. 257-314; Botkin, D.B., (1992) The Ecology of Forests: Theory and Evidence, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Botkin, D.B., Janak, J.F., Wallis, J.R., Some ecological consequences of a computer model of forest growth (1972) The Journal of Ecology, 60, pp. 849-873; Chesson, P., Pantastico-Caldas, M., The forest architecture hypothesis for diversity maintenance (1994) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 9, pp. 79-80; Cole, K., Past rates of change, species richness, and a model of vegetational inertia in the Grand Canyon, Arizona (1985) American Naturalist, 125, pp. 289-303; Davis, M.B., Climatic instability, time lags, and community disequilibrium (1986) Community Ecology, pp. 269-284. , J., Diamond, T.J., Case, Harper & Row, New York; Davis, M.B., Lags in vegetation response to greenhouse warming (1989) Climatic Change, 15, pp. 75-82; Davis, M.B., Botkin, D.B., Sensitivity of cool-temperate forests and their fossil pollen record to rapid temperature change (1985) Quaternary Research, 23, pp. 327-340; Gilpin, M. & Hanski, I.
