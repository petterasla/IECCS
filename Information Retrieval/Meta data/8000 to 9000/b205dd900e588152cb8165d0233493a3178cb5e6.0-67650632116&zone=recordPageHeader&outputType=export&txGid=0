This paper focuses on the consumption of different primary energy sources and it identifies that coal will continue to remain as the prime energy source in foreseeable future. It examines the energy requirement perspective for India and demand of coal as the prime energy source. Economic development and poverty alleviation depend on securing affordable energy sources and Indian coal mining industry offers a bright future for the country's energy security, provided the industry is allowed to develop by supportive government policies and adopts latest technologies for mining. It is an irony that in-spite of having a plentiful reserves, India is not able to jack up coal production to meet its current and future demand. It discusses the strategies to be adopted for growth and meeting the coal demand. But such energy are very much concerned with environmental degradation and must be driven by contemporary managerial acumen addressing environmental and social challenges effectively The paper highlights the emissions of greenhouse gases due to burning of fossil fuels and environmental consequences of global warming and sea-level rise. Technological solutions for environment friendly coal mining and environmental laws for the abatement of environmental degradation are discussed in this paper. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Consumption; Exponential; Greenhouse; Oil equivalent; Power; Utility","Consumption; Exponential; Oil equivalent; Power; Utility; Coal; Degradation; Environmental regulations; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Mining; Reserves to production ratio; Coal industry; coal; fossil fuel; abatement cost; coal mining; coal production; economic development; environmental degradation; environmental economics; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; pollution tax; poverty alleviation; sustainability; article; bioremediation; biotechnological procedures; coal gasification; coal mining; coal power; economic development; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; government regulation; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; India; law; policy; poverty; risk assessment; sea level rise; Coal; Conservation of Natural Resources; Energy-Generating Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",,"Coal",,,,"Abbasi, S.A., Ramesh, N., Geothermal energy: Potential, recovery and environmental impacts (2002) Journal of the Institution of Public Health Engineers, 1, pp. 30-43; (1988) The World Resources 1988-89, , Anonymous New York: Basic Books; (2003) Ministry of Coal and Mines, , Anonymous Government of India, New Delhi; Banerjee, S.P., Social dimensions of the mining sector (2004) Journal of the Institution of Engineers (India), 85, pp. 5-10; Barney, G.O., (1980) The Global 2000 Report to the President, , 2 vols.
