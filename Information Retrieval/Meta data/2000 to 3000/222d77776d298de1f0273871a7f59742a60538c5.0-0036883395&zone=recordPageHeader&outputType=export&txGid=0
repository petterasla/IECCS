The resistance to fatigue was estimated at a sliding speed of 17.6 m/sec, bearing backside temperature of 170°C, and using a SAE5W-30 SH lubricant. In the case of establishing globalwarming as a category of environmental impacts, CO2 emissions exerted a stronger influence than CH4 and N2O. A difference in the chemical composition and in the production processes did not practically exert any effect on the emission. In the case of overlay-provided kelmet bearings, the environmental impact was ∼ 2.7 times stronger than that for aluminum alloy bearings and the environmental impact of the process of overlay plating process amounted ∼ 60% of the full impact. Miniaturization of bearings and an improvement of their performance could reduce significantly the environmental impacts due to a reduction of amounts of used raw materials and energy consumed.",,"aluminum alloy; automobile; engine; environmental impact; performance assessment; plain bearing; tribology",,,,,,"Kobayashi, O., LCA of automobiles (1998) JAMAGAZINE, 32 (6), p. 2; (1997) Environmental Management - Life Cycle Assessment - Principles and Framework; (2000) ISO Standard: LCA Software ""JEMAI-LCA""; Method of rationalization of energy consumption (1995) Kokusai Chosa (International Survey); (1993) Report on Analysis and Examination of Energy of Basic Raw Materials; Basic research for the construction of a system for evaluation of environmental pollution (1995) Examination Report (Special Issue), Inventory Data on Metal Materials; (1998) Introduction to LCA Embodiment, p. 65; (1995) Science of Variation of Climate; Kamiya, S., (1999) Development of High Normal Pressure and Long Service Life Bearings for Diesel Engines, p. 33. , Thesis of Nagoya University","Desaki, T.; Research Department, Taiho Kogyo Co., Ltd., 47, Hosoya-cho 2-chome, Toyota-shi, Aichi 471-8502, Japan",,,,,,,,10457828,,,,"English","Jpn.
