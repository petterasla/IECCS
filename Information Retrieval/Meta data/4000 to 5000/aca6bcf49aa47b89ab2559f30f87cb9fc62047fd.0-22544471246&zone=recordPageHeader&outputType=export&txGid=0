This local episode of channel incision correlates with other alluvial stratigraphic studies from the central Great Plains and demonstrates regionally synchronous fluvial behaviour. Proxy records of palaeohydrologic conditions in and around the Great Plains (including lacustrine, aeolian and geomorphological sources) indicate that channel incision correlates with a multicentennial episode of common, widespread drought. Temporally, this drought episode corresponds to the period recognized in many regions as the Mediaeval Warm Period (MWP). Therefore, this research demonstrates: (1) a relationship in the semi-arid central Great Plains between drought and increased fluvial incision; and (2) a local/regional geomorphic response to a particular episode of global climate change. © 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.","Alluvial stratigraphy; Channel incision; Environmental change; Fluvial geomorphology; Great Plains; Mediaeval Warm Period; Palaeohydrology","alluvial deposit; Holocene; Medieval Warm Period; stratigraphy; Great Plains; North America; Western Hemisphere; World; Arida",,,,,,"Arbogast, A.F., Stratigraphic evidence for late-Holocene aeolian sand mobilization and soil formation in south-central Kansas (1996) Journal of Arid Environments, 34, pp. 403-414; Arbogast, A.F., Johnson, W.C., Climatic implications of the late Quaternary alluvial record of a small drainage basin in the central Great Plains (1994) Quaternary Research, 41, pp. 298-305; Baker, R.G., Fredlund, G.G., Mandel, R.D., Bettis, E.A., Holocene environments of the central Great Plains: Multi-proxy evidence from alluvial sequences, southeastern Nebraska (2000) Quaternary International, 67, pp. 75-88; Barry, R.G., Chorley, R.J., (1982) Atmosphere, Weather and Climate.
