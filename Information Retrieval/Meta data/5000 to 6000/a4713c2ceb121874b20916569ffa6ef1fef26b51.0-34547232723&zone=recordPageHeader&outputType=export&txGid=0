A means of mitigating its effects is to collect industrial carbon dioxide and sequester it in the deep ocean. Knowledge of effects of such sequestration on deep-sea organisms is crucial to evaluation of the wisdom of deep-ocean sequestration. We therefore tested deep-sea animals for indications that exposure to carbon dioxide-rich seawater is stressful. Our study site was at 3087 m depth off the coast of central California (36° 41.91′ N, 123° 0.14′ W). We deployed liquid carbon dioxide in open-topped containers on the sea floor. The carbon dioxide reacted with the carbonate system in the overlying seawater, and carbon dioxide-rich seawater flowed out onto the sediment. We placed inverted-funnel traps near the containers and ∼75 m away from them. Measurements of pH confirmed that the area near the containers was exposed to carbon dioxide-rich seawater. As a test taxon, we chose harpacticoid copepods. The traps near the source of the carbon dioxide-rich seawater caught significantly more harpacticoids than those far from it. The harpacticoids apparently attempted to escape from the advancing front of carbon dioxide-rich seawater and therefore presumably found exposure to it to be stressful. © Inter-Research 2007.","Benthic infauna; Co2 sequestration; Deep sea; Emergence; Global warming; Harpacticoid copepods","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; crustacean; deep-sea benthos; environmental stress; escape behavior; seawater; California; North America; United States; Animalia; Copepoda; Harpacticoida",,,,,,"Armonies, W., Active emergence of meiofauna from an intertidal sediment (1988) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 43, pp. 151-159; Barry, J.P., Seibel, B.A., Drazen, J.C., Tamburri, M.N., Deep-sea field experiments on the biological impacts of direct deep-sea CO2 injection (2003) Proceedings of the Second Annual Conference on Carbon Sequestration, pp. 1-7. , US Department of Energy, Alexandria, VA, p; Barry, J.P., Buck, K.R., Lovera, C., Kuhnz, L., Whaling, P.J., Peltzer, E.T., Walz, P., Brewer, P.G., Effects of direct ocean CO2 injection on deep-sea meiofauna (2004) J Oceanogr, 60, pp. 759-766; Barry, J.P., Buck, K.R., Lovera, C., Kuhnz, L., Whaling, P.J., Utility of deep-sea CO2 release experiments in understanding the biology of a high CO2 ocean: Effects of hypercapnia on deep-sea meiofauna (2005) J Geophys Res, 110, pp. C09S12. , doi:10.1029/2004JC002629; Bell, S.S., Walters, K., Kern, J.C., Meiofauna from seagrass habitats: A review and prospectus for future research (1984) Estuaries, 7, pp. 331-338; Bray, J.R., Curtis, J.T., An ordination of the upland forest communities of southern Wisconsin (1957) Ecol Monogr, 27, pp. 325-349; Brewer, P.G., Friederich, G., Peltzer, E.T., Orr Jr, F.M., Direct experiments on the ocean disposal of fossil fuel CO2 (1999) Science, 284, pp. 943-945; Brewer, P.G., Peltzer, E.T., Walz, P., Aya, I., Deep ocean experiments with fossil fuel carbon dioxide: Creation and sensing of a controlled plume at 4 km depth (2005) J Mar Res, 63, pp. 9-33; Carman, K.R., Thistle, D., Fleeger, J.W., Barry, J.P., Influence of introduced CO2 on deep-sea metazoan meiofauna (2004) J Oceanogr, 60, pp. 767-772; Clarke KR, Gorley RN (2001) Primer V.5: user manual/ tutorial.
