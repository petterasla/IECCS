In a three-year study, phenological shifts due to experimental warming markedly altered trophic relationships between plants and insect herbivores, causing a dramatic decline of reproductive capacity for one of the plant species. In a Tibetan meadow, the gentian (Gentiana formosa) typically flowers after the peak larva density of a noctuid moth (Melanchra pisi ) that primarily feeds on a dominant forb (anemone, Anemone trullifolia var. linearis). However, artificial warming of ;1.58C advanced gentian flower phenology and anemone vegetative phenology by a week, but delayed moth larvae emergence by two weeks. The warming increased larval density 10-fold, but decreased anemone density by 30%. The phenological and density shifts under warmed conditions resulted in the insect larvae feeding substantially on the gentian flowers and ovules; there was ;100-fold more damage in warmed than in unwarmed chambers. This radically increased trophic connection reduced gentian plant reproduction and likely contributed to its reduced abundance in the warmed chambers. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Alpine meadow; Anemone trullifolia var. linearis; Biodiversity; Gentiana formosa; Global warming; Melanchra pisi; Phenological shift; Trophic interaction","abundance; alpine environment; climate change; dicotyledon; flower; global warming; meadow; moth; phenology; reproductive biology; species diversity; trophic interaction; Anemone; animal; article; China; ecosystem; flower; gentian; greenhouse effect; host parasite interaction; larva; moth; parasitology; physiology; reproduction; Anemone; Animals; Ecosystem; Flowers; Gentiana; Global Warming; Host-Parasite Interactions; Larva; Moths; Reproduction; Tibet; Anemone; Anemone trullifolia; Gentiana; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Melanchra; Noctuidae",,,,,,"Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Awmack, C., Bezemer, T.M., Brown, V.K., Butterfield, J., Whittaker, J.B., Herbivory in global climate change research: Direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Global Change Biology, 8 (1), pp. 1-16. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2486.2002.00451.x; Barton, B.T., Schmitz, O.J., Experimental warming transforms multiple predator effects in a grassland food web (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 1317-1325; Bertin, R.I., Plant phenology and distribution in relation to recent climate change (2008) Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society, 135 (1), pp. 126-146. , DOI 10.3159/07-RP-035R.1; Emlen, J.M., The role of time and energy in food preference (1966) American Naturalist, 100, pp. 611-617; Gedan, K.B., Bertness, M.D., Experimental warming causes rapid loss of plant diversity in New England salt marshes (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 842-848; Greenslade, P., Climate variability, biological control and an insect pest outbreak on Australia's Coral Sea islets: Lessons for invertebrate conservation (2008) Journal of Insect Conservation, 12, pp. 333-342; Harrington, R., Fleming, R.A., Woiwod, I.P., Climate change impacts on insect management and conservation in temperate regions: Can they be predicted?
