in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single-site or single-species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971-2000). Our results showed that 78% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30% significantly) and only 3% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade-1 in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days °C-1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day °C-1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r = -0.69, P &lt; 0.001). © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Europe; Growing season; Meta analysis; Phenology; Season; Temperature response; Trend","climate change; global change; global warming; growing season; phenology; terrestrial ecosystem; Eurasia; Europe; Animalia",,,,,,"Defila, C., Clot, B., Phytophenological trends in Switzerland (2001) International Journal of Biometeorology, 41, pp. 203-207; Defila, C., Clot, B., Phytophenological trends in the Swiss Alps, 1951-2002 (2005) Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 14, pp. 191-196; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in the flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Hughes, L., Biological consequences of global warming (2000) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 15, pp. 56-61; Keeling, C.D., Chin, J.F.S., Whorf, T.P., Increased activity of northern vegetation inferred from atmospheric CO2 measurements (1996) Nature, 382, pp. 146-149; Kozlov, M.V., Berlina, N.G., Decline in length of the summer season on the Kola Peninsula, Russia (2002) Climatic Change, 54, pp. 387-398; Contribution of working group II to the third assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerability, p. 1032. , IPCC In: (eds McCarthy JJ, Canziani OF, Leary NA, Dokken DJ, White KS) Cambridge University Press, New York; Meier, U., (1997) BBCH-Monograph.
