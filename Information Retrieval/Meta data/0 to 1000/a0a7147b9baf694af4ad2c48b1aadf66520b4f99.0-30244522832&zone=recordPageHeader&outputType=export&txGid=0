This project leads the development of the impact pathway, or damage function approach for analysis of the environmental and social impacts of energy use. The methodology allows highly detailed and spatially disaggregated analysis of pollutant damage, following a logical progression from characterisation of emissions, through modelling of pollutant dispersion and atmospheric lifetime, to determination of impacts using appropriate dose-response functions, and associated economic costs. The project team is multi-disciplinary and the various models used have been the subject of international review. Assessment of the effects of climate change is at a less advanced state than analysis of, for example, air pollution effects on health, materials and crops, or occupational health impacts. However, preliminary results are available based on a review of damage estimates from the available literature, and a more detailed methodology is being developed. Both are described in this paper, together with a review of the major uncertainties.",,,,,,,,"Cline, W.R., (1991) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington; Fankhauser, S., (1995) Valuing Climate Change - The Economics of the Greenhouse, , EarthScan, London; Tol, R.S.J., (1995) The Damage Costs of Global Warming, , Monograph, Institute of Environmental Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Hohmeyer, O., Gärtner, M., (1992) The Costs of Climate Change, , Fraunhofer Institut, Germany; (1995) Externalities of Energy 'ExternE' Project, , Report Number 1, Summary; Audus, H., Saroff, L., (1995) Energy Conservation and Management, 36, p. 831; Holland, M.R., Berry, J.E., Johnson, C.J., (1995) Energy Conservation and Management, 36, p. 853; (1992) Emissions Scenarios for the IPCC, an Update; (1995) Externalities of Energy 'ExternE' Project, , Report Number 2, Methodology; Wigley, T.M.L., Holt, T., Raper, S.C.B., (1991) STUGE Users' Manual, , University of East Anglia; Pearce, D., Bann, C., Georgiou, S., (1992) The Social Costs of Fuel Cycles, , HMSO, London; (1994) Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: The 1994 Report of the Scientific Assessment Working Group of IPCC; Kane, S., Reilly, J., Tobey, J., (1992) Climatic Change, 21, pp. 17-35; Harvey, L.D.D., (1992) Climatic Change, 22, pp. 273-275; Downing, T.E., (1995) Climate Change and World Food Security, , Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg forthcoming","Holland, M.R.; ETSU, Harwell, Oxon OX11 0RA, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
