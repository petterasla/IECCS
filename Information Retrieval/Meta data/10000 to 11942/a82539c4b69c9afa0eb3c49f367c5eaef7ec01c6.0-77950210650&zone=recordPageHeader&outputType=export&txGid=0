However, the dynamics of R S are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained. Ecosystem warming experiments, modelling analyses and fundamental biokinetics all suggest that R S should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R S, inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R S on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R S values in the extant four-decade record of R S chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R S observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R S record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO 2 measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961ĝ€""1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R S. We estimate that the global R S in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth ™s land surface over 2008) was 98 ± 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr-1 between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R S response to air temperature (Q 10) of 1.5. An increasing global R S value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
