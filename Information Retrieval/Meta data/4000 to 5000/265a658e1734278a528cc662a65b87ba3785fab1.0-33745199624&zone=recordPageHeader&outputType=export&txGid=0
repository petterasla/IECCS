We analyze the changes in intensity and duration of Baiu-Changma-Meiyu rain by global warming using daily precipitation data of fifteen coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) simulations under the SRES A1B scenario at the end of the twenty-first century. It is revealed that a delay in early summer rain withdrawal over the region extending from Taiwan, Ryukyu Islands to the south of Japan is contrasted with an earlier withdrawal over the Yangtze Basin, although the latter is not significant due to inconsistent sign of changes among the models. Higher mean sea-level pressure anomalies in the tropical western Pacific in the future may be related to these late withdrawals. Changes in onset dates are relatively less compared to those in withdrawal dates. © 2006, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"atmosphere-ocean system; general circulation model; global warming; precipitation intensity; regional climate; Asia; Eurasia; Far East",,,,,,"Giorgi, F., Mearns, L.O., Calculation of average, uncertainty range, and reliability of regional climate changes from AOGCM simulations via the ""Reliability Ensemble Average"" (REA) method (2002) J.
