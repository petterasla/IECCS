By analyzing the relationship between warming structure and altitude (1 000-5 000 m) in the TP and its vicinities using the 46-year January mean observed temperature data, we found that there was a significant altitude effect of temperature warming onset time (mutation time) on the plateau and the neighboring regions: the higher the altitude, the later the climate warming happens, and vice versa. There also seems a slight altitude effect on warming magnitude: the higher the altitude, the less the warming magnitude. Therefore, the temperature warming in the high altitude area of the TP (below 5 000 m) responds to global warming less sensitively than the low-altitude neighboring areas both in onset time and magnitude, which may be mainly caused by high albedo and large thermal capacity of the ice/snow cover on the higher part of the plateau and possible heat island effect in the lower part of the plateau. © 2010 China University of Geosciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Altitude effect; Climatic variation; Tibetan plateau","altitude; climate change; climate variation; global climate; global warming; heat island; snow cover; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,,,,,"An, Z.S., Kutzbach, J.E., Prell, W.L., Evolution of Asian Monsoons and Phased Uplift of the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau since Late Miocene Times (2001) Nature, 411 (6833), pp. 62-66; Beniston, M., Rebetez, M., Regional Behavior of Minimum Temperatures in Switzerland for the Period 1979-1993 (1996) Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 53, pp. 231-243; Cheng, G.D., Li, P., Zhang, X., (1997) Influences of Climatic Changes on Snow Cover, Glaciers and Frozen Soils in China, , Lanzhou: Gansu Cultural Publishing House; Cheng, G.D., Li, S., Liu, X., Recent Climatic Warming over the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet)/Plateau and Its Influences on Environment (1999) Chinese Science Bulletin, 44 (SUPPL.), pp. 264-268; Dong, G., Huang, Y., Chen, H., (1995) The Formation and Evolution of the Deserts in China and Their Relation to the Uplifting of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Chinese Society of the Tibetan Plateau Research, Collection of Papers of Tibetan Plateau and Global Variations, , Beijing: China Meteorological Press; Du, M.Y., Kawashima, S., Yonemura, S., Mutual Influence between Human Activities and Climate Change in the Tibetan Plateau during Recent Years (in Human Dimensions and Natural Processes in Environmental Change) (2004) Global and Planetary Change, 41 (3-4), pp. 241-249; Fang, C., Moncrieff, J.B., The Dependence of Soil CO2 Efflux on Temperature (2001) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 33, pp. 155-165; Feidas, H.C., Noulopoulou, T.M., Bora-Senta, E., Trend Analysis of Precipitation Time Series in Greece and Their Relationship with Circulation Using Surface and Satellite Data: 1955-2001 (2007) Theoretical Applied Climatology, 87, pp. 155-177; Feng, S., Tang, M.C., Wang, D.M., New Proofs for the Tibetan Plateau as the ""Origin"" Area of Climatic Changes in China (1998) Chinese Science Bulletin, 43 (6), pp. 633-636; Fluteau, F., Besse, J., Ramstein, G., Simulating the Evolution of the Asian and African Monsoons during the Past 30 Million Years Using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, pp. 11995-12018; Giorgi, F., Hurrell, J.W., Marinucci, M.R., Elevation Dependency of the Surface Climate Change Signal: A Model Study (1997) Journal of Climate, 10, pp. 288-296; Kendall, M.G., (1955) Rank Correlation Methods, , London: Griffin; Hansen, J., Lebedeff, S., Global Trends of Measured Surface Air Temperature (1987) Journal of Geophysical Research, 92 (D11), pp. 13345-13372; He, Y.Q., Lu, A.G., Zhang, Z.L., Seasonal Variation of Regional Warming-up Structure across China in the Past Half Century (2005) Climate Research, 28, pp. 213-219; Hirota, M., Tang, Y.H., Hu, Q.W., The Potential Importance of Grazing to the Fluxes of Carbon Dioxide and Methane in an Alpine Wetland on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau (2005) Atmospheric Environment, 39, pp. 5255-5259; Hou, S.G., Qin, D.H., Yao, T.D., Recent Change of the Ice Core Accumulation Rates on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (2002) Chinese Science Bulletin, 47 (20), pp. 1746-1749; Hou, X.Y., Zhang, X., (1980) Rules and Methods of Vegetation Division of China, , The Editorial Board of Vegetation of China, Beijing: Vegetation of China.
