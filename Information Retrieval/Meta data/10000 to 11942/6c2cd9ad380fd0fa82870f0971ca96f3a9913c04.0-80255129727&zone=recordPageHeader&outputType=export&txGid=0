We employed this method to describe aspects of thermal ecology for an exposed algal reef in the tropics (O'ahu, Hawai'i). In addition, we compared temperatures of the surrounding habitat as determined by IR thermography and traditional waterproof loggers. Images of reef organisms (6 macroalgae, 9 molluscs, 1 anthozoan, and 2 echinoderms), loggers, and landscapes were taken during two diurnal low tides. Analysis of IR thermographs revealed remarkable thermal complexity on a narrow tropical shore, as habitats ranged from 18.1 to 38.3°C and surfaces of organisms that ranged from 21.1 to 33.2°C. The near 20°C difference between abiotic habitats and the mosaic of temperatures experienced by reef organisms across the shore are similar to findings from temperate studies using specialized longterm loggers. Further, IR thermography captured rapid temperature fluctuations that were related to tidal height and cross-correlated to wave action. Finally, we gathered evidence that tidal species were associated with particular temperature ranges and that two species possess morphological characteristics that limit thermal stress. Loggers provided similar results as thermography but lack the ability to resolve variation in fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns. Our results support the utility of IR thermography in exploring thermal ecology, and demonstrate the steps needed to calibrate data leading to establishment of baseline conditions in a changing and heterogeneous environment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Global climate change; Intertidal zones; Method; Thermal stress; Thermography; Tropical","calibration; climate change; coral reef; environmental stress; feasibility study; functional morphology; habitat type; heterogeneity; infrared imagery; intertidal environment; invertebrate; landscape; macroalga; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; survey; temperature effect; tropical environment; waterproofing; algae; Anthozoa; Echinodermata; Mollusca",,,,,,"Abbott, I.A., (1999) Marine Red Algae of the Hawaiian Islands, , Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press; Abbott, I.A., Huisman, J.M., (2004) Marine Green and Brown Algae of the Hawaiian Islands, , Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press; Beach, K.S., Smith, C.M., Ecophysiology of tropical rhodophytes.
