In 2003 the Government of Canada launched the Forest 2020 Plantation Development and Assessment Initiative to assess the potential for fast-growing woody crops to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Across the country 6000 ha of plantations were established and monitored on nonforested lands (afforestation) using a variety of methods. Economic analyses assessed the investment attractiveness of this mitigation measure for a range of species and suitable lands, taking into account such factors as growth rates, agricultural opportunity costs and a range of possible carbon values. Analyses illustrated that at current trading prices for carbon and for much of the available lands and expanding markets for forest bioproducts, expected rates of return on investment for afforestation were relatively low. However, higher future carbon prices, combined with monetary values for environmental benefits, could dramatically change the economics of afforestation in the future.","Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Fast-growing trees; Forest carbon offset project; Forest investment analysis; Hybrid poplar; Hybrids; Policy analysis; Risk analysis","Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Forest investment analysis; Forest investments; Hybrid poplar; Policy analysis; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Profitability; Reforestation; Risk analysis; Safety factor; Risk assessment; afforestation; agricultural development; anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; deciduous tree; dicotyledon; emissions trading; forest management; forest product; forestry policy; greenhouse gas; hybrid; mitigation; natural resource; plantation forestry; price dynamics; risk assessment; Chelation; Climates; Cost Analysis; Forestation; Greenhouse Gases; Hybrids; Investment; Planning; Populus; Profitability; Reforestation; Risk Assessment; Canada",,,,,,"(2009) Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 2007, , http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1186517615847&= eng, Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration Shelterbelt Centre [online; modified 2007 Aug. 7] [Accessed 15 June]; Black, F., Scholes, M., The pricing of options and corporate liabilities (1973) J.
