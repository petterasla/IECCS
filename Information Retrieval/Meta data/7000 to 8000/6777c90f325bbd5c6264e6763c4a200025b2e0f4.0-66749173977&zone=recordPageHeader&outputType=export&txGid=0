Dietary reconstructions inferred from stable isotopes of fossil herbivorous mammalian tooth enamel document environmental and climatic changes in ancient ecosystems, including C3/C4 transitions and relative seasonality. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we use stable carbon and oxygen isotopes preserved in fossil teeth to document the magnitude of mammalian dietary shifts and ancient floral change during geologically documented glacial and interglacial periods during the Pliocene (∼1.9 million years ago) and Pleistocene (∼1.3 million years ago) in Florida. Stable isotope data demonstrate increased aridity, increased C4 grass consumption, inter-faunal dietary partitioning, increased isotopic niche breadth of mixed feeders, niche partitioning of phylogenetically similar taxa, and differences in relative seasonality with warming. Conclusion/Significance: Our data show that global warming resulted in dramatic vegetation and dietary changes even at lower latitudes (∼28°N). Our results also question the use of models that predict the long term decline and extinction of species based on the assumption that niches are conserved over time. These findings have immediate relevance to clarifying possible biotic responses to current global warming in modern ecosystems. © 2009 DeSanti et al.",,"carbon; oxygen; stable isotope; animal tissue; Antiquity; article; climate change; controlled study; ecological niche; ecosystem; environmental change; fossil; glacial period; greenhouse effect; interglacial; mammalian genetics; nonhuman; phylogeny; Pleistocene; Pliocene; resource partitioning; species extinction; taxonomy; tooth; United States; vegetation; animal; biodiversity; climate; diet; enamel; environment; human; mammal; methodology; paleontology; pathology; season; Mammalia; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate; Dental Enamel; Diet; Ecosystem; Environment; Fossils; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Mammals; Oxygen Isotopes; Paleontology; Phylogeny; Seasons",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen Isotopes",,,,"Walther, G.-R., Post, E., Convey, P., Menzel, A., Parmesan, C., Ecological responses to recent climate change (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 389-395; Parmesan, C., Yohe, G., A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 37-42; Post, E., Forchhammer, M.C., Spatial synchrony of local populations has increased in association with the recent Northern Hemisphere climate trend (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101, pp. 9286-9290; Thomas, C.D., Cameron, A., Green, R.E., Bakkenes, M., Beaumont, L.J., Extinction risk from climate change (2004) Nature, 427, pp. 145-148; Thuiller, W., Lavorel, S., Araújo, M.B., Niche properties and geographic extent as predictors of species sensitivity to climate change (2005) Global Eco Biogeogr, 14, pp. 347-357; Levinsky, I., Skov, F., Svenning, J.-C., Rahbek, C., Potential impacts of climate change on the distributions and diversity patterns of European mammals (2007) Biodiversity Conserv, 11, pp. 453-462; Barnosky, A.D., Bell, C.J., Emslie, S.D., Goodwin, H.T., Mead, J.I., Exceptional record of mid-Pleistocene vertebrates helps differentiate climate from anthropogenic ecosystem perturbations (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101, pp. 9297-9302; Koch, P.L., Hoppe, K.A., Webb, S.D., The isotope ecology of late Pleistocene mammals in North America, Part 1: Florida (1998) Chem Geol, 152, pp. 119-138; Feranec RS (2004) Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of marmot cheek teeth from the Pit Locality.
