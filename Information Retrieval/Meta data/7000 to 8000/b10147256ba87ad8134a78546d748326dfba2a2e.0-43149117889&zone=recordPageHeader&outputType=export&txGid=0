Nowadays, Semarang coastal area in Indonesia is already subject to coastal hazard due to tidal inundation and land subsidence. The impact of the inundation is predicted to be even more severe with the scenario of sea level rise. This paper concentrates on the risk assessment to the population, land use, and monetary losses as a result of coastal inundation under enhanced sea level rise. This paper uses the scenario of the depth of inundation to generate coastal inundation model using GIS-Technology. Anticipatory issues including methodology development for hazard assessment would be necessary for Semarang coastal area, and therefore, geo-information technology can be considered as a useful tool to rapidly assess the impact of the coastal hazard and evaluate the economic losses. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","GIS; Indonesia; Inundation model; Sea level rise; Semarang; Vulnerability","Coastal zones; Economic analysis; Geographic information systems; Geology; Land use; Coastal hazard; Economic losses; Inundation model; Sea level rise (SLR); Sea level; coastal zone; economic impact; flooding; GIS; global warming; hazard assessment; landslide; risk assessment; sea level change; vulnerability; Asia; Central Java; Eurasia; Indonesia; Semarang; Southeast Asia",,,,,,"(1984) Greenhouse Effect and Sea Level Rise, , Barth MC, Titus JG (eds) Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York; Bryan, B., Harvey, N., Belerio, T., Bourman, B., Distributed process modeling for regional assessment of coastal vulnerability to sea level rise (2001) Environ Model Assess, 6, pp. 57-65; Demerkisen, A.C., Evrendilek, F., Berberoglu, S., Killie, S., Coastal flood risk analysis using Landsat-7 ETM+ Imagery and SRTM DEM: A case study of Izmir, Turkey (2006) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, , doi: 10.1007/s10661-006-9476-2; (2000) Profile of Semarang Coastal Area (In Indonesian), , Development Planning Board (DPB).
