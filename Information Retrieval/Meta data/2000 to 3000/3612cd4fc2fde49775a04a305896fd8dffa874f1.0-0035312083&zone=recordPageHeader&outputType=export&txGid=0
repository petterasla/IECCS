The atomic concentration ratio of N/Si was 0.075 at a plasma discharge power of 0.5 kW and an exposure time of 1 min and 0.176 at a plasma power of 2.0 kW and an exposure time of 3 min, as determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. A progressive reduction in the oxidation rate with increasing N concentration, corresponding to an increase in N plasma power, was observed. The uniformity of film thickness over a 4-inch wafer was improved after nitrogen plasma exposure and rapid thermal oxidation, with a thickness variation of less than 2.6% compared with 13.2% for the N2O thermal oxidation process. The advantages of exposing Si to N plasma for application in silicon devices was investigated by high-frequency capacitance-voltage measurements. A distortion in the capacitance-voltage curve was observed for samples that did not undergo nitridation, a distortion that was not observed in the nitrided samples. Capacitance-voltage curve distortion was found to be significantly reduced by Si nitridation under low plasma power.",,"Current voltage characteristics; Flash memory; Nitriding; Plasma applications; Silicon nitride; Thermooxidation; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Atomic concentration ratio; Nitrogen plasma; Oxynitridation; Rapid thermal oxidation; Silicon wafers",,,,,,"Hori, T., Iwasaki, H., (1989) IEEE Electron.
