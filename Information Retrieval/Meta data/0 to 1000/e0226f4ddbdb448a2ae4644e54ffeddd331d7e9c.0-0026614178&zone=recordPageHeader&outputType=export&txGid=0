We point out that the scale of pollution arising from natural human functions is considerable given the size of the world human population. Additions to this background from industrial processes can be reduced considerably by technical means, but not eliminated entirely. The same 'contaminants' associated with industrial energy consumption (SO2, NOx, CO2) are also produced by natural processes. The sum of these three sources gives rise to a considerable 'irreducible' minimum background pollution level: the ecological consequences of this need to be explored further. © 1992.","acid rain; carbon dioxide; ecological effects; global warming; nitrogen deposition; pollution","carbon dioxide; nitrogen; acid rain; article; ecology; greenhouse effect; pollution; acid rain; carbon dioxide enrichment; ecological effect; long-term impact; man-environment relations; nitrogen; pollution problem",,,,,,"Abrahamsen, Acid precipitation, plant nutrients and forest growth (1980) Ecological Impact of Acid Precipitation, pp. 58-63. , D.
