As the intermediate hosts for schistosomes, snails play an obligatory role in schistosomiasis transmission. In order to determine the impact of low temperature on snail survival, we studied crystallization temperature (Tc) and lower lethal temperature (LLT) of the snail Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host of human blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum, under different physiological conditions. The mean T c of 'dry' snails was -12.79 ± 1.17°C, which is significantly lower than that of 'wet' snails (-5.36 ± 2.11°C). Survival of 'dry' snails was high (92% after 24 h) when the temperature was higher than -7°C, then decreased rapidly between -7°C and -12°C (92% to 0 % after 24h). LT 50 between 0.25 h and 24 h exposure was between -10.8 °C and -9.4°C. Our data suggest that O. hupensis out of water could be avoiding freezing. As winter temperatures continue to rise due to global warming, O. hupensis may increase its range, thereby spreading schistosomiasis to the northern part of China. © 2010 Malacological Society of Australasia &amp; Society for the Study of Molluscan Diversity.","Cold hardiness; Crystallization; Low thermal tolerance; Schistosoma japonicum; Schistosomiasis; Supercooling","Gastropoda; Oncomelania hupensis; Schistosoma; Schistosoma japonicum; Schistosomatidae; Trematoda",,,,,,"Ansart, A., Vernon, P., Cold hardiness in molluscs (2003) Acta Oecologica, 24, pp. 95-102; Ansart, A., Vernon, P., Cold hardiness abilities vary with the size of the land snail Cornu aspersum (2004) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A, 139, pp. 205-211; Ansart, A., Vernon, P., Danguzan, J., Elements of cold hardiness in a littoral population of the land snail Helix aspersa(Gastropoda: Pulmonata) (2002) Journal of Comparative Physiology B, 172, pp. 619-625; Block, W., To freeze or not to freeze?
