Sources of uncertainty are discussed. Critical assessment of climate models for their veracity in describing the present climate is considered essential. Methods of deriving sub-continental scale patterns of climate change, per degree of global warming, include the use of finer resolution global models, nested modelling, and spatial interpolation. Transient effects and the importance of extreme events are also discussed. © 1995.","Climate change; Global climate models; Greenhouse effect; Scenarios",,,,,,,"Houghton, Callander, Varney, (1992) The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Whetton, Pittock, Australian region intercomparison of the results of some greenhouse general circulation modelling experiments (1991) Technical Paper, No. 21, p. 73. , CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research; Pittock, Climate scenario development (1993) Modelling Change in Environmental Systems, pp. 481-503. , A.J.
