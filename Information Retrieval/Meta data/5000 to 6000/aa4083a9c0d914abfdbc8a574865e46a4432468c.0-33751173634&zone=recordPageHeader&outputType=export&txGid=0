The combination of solid-state refrigerants, water-based heat transfer fluids, and high efficiency will lead to environmentally desirable products with minimal contributions to global warming. Among the numerous applications of refrigeration technology, air conditioning applications provide the largest aggregate cooling power and use the greatest quantity of electric energy. The primacy of the air conditioning application makes the establishment of cost targets for this application an essential feature of the R&D plan for magnetic refrigeration technology. A preliminary assessment of the permanent magnet costs and magnetocaloric material costs indicates that, for suitably chosen materials and operating conditions, these costs lay well below the total manufactured costs for vapor compression based air conditioners. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.","Air conditioning; Cost effectiveness; Magnetic refrigerator; Survey","Air conditioning; Cost effectiveness; Global warming; Heat transfer; Refrigerants; Water; Cooling power; Magnetic refrigerator; Water-based heat transfer fluids; Refrigeration",,,,,,"Japan Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Industry Association (JRAIA), (2005) Estimates of World Demand for Air Conditioners (2000-2008), , http://www.jraia.or.jp/frameset_english.html; Legvold, S., Rare earth metals and alloys (1980) Ferromagnetic Materials, 1, pp. 1-634. , (p. 274).
