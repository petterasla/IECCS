This paper presents estimations for the UK, an industrialized temperate country with intensive land-use and little natural vegetation cover. There is a need for a clear definition of the distinction between natural and anthropogenic sources where the capacity of the biosphere to act as a sink is limited by human intervention. In the method adopted here, distinction is made between emissions from activities not associated with biological activity, defined as anthropogenic, and exclusively from biological processes, with or without human intervention. The relative contributions of the different gases is also significantly affected by the time horizon, and hence the assumed global warming potential adopted for the analysis. -from Authors",,"anthropogenic source; biological activity; climate framework convention; emission measurement; global warming; greenhouse gas; greenhouse gas emission; inventory; man-environment relations; UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; UK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027330769
