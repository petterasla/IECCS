In wastewater, N compounds contribute to eutrophication and toxicity in water cycle. Removal of N via vegetative filters and specifically in short-rotation energy plantations, is a relatively new approach to managing nitrogenous effluents. Though combustion of energy crops is in principle carbon neutral, in practice, N content may contribute to NOx emissions with significant global warming potential. Intermediate pyrolysis produces advanced fuels while reducing such emissions. By operating at intermediate temperature (500°C), it retains most N in char as pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, quaternary-N and amines. In addition, biochar provides long-term sequestration of carbon in soils.","Carbon and nitrogen sequestration; Intermediate pyrolysis; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrogen fixation; NOx emission; Vegetative filters; Wastewater treatment","biofiltration; biomass burning; carbon sequestration; combustion; crop rotation; emission control; energy crop; eutrophication; global warming; hydrological cycle; irrigation system; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen oxides; pollutant removal; pyrolysis; waste management; waste treatment; wastewater",,,,,,"Nitrogen uptake in New Zealand short rotation crops (2005) Short Rotation Crops For Bioenergy, pp. 235-240. , (New Zealand); Pandey, A., Srivastava, R.K., Role of dendropower in wastewater treatment and sustaining economy (2010) J Cleaner Prod, 18, pp. 1113-1117; Vasudevan, P., Thapliyal, A., Srivastava, R.K., Pandey, A., Dastidar, M.G., Fertigation potential of domestic wastewater for tree plantations (2010) J Sci Ind Res, 69, pp. 146-150; Patterson, R., (2003) Nitrogen In Wastewater and Its Role In Constraining On-site Planning In Future Directions For On-site Systems: Best Management Practice, In On-site'03 Conf, pp. 313-320. , University of New England, Armidale; Abeliovich, A., Transformations of ammonia and the environmental impact of nitrifying bacteria (1992) Biodegradation, 3, pp. 255-264; (1985) Ambient Water Quality Criteria For Ammonia (440/5-85-001), , [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA]; Oglesby, R.T., Edmondson, W.T., Control of Eutrophication (1996) J Water Pollut Cont Fed, 38, pp. 1452-1460; Knobeloch, L., Salna, B., Hogan, A., Postle, J., Anderson, H., Blue babies and nitrate-contaminated well water (2000) Environ Hlth Persp, 108, pp. 675-678; L'hirondel, J., L'hirondel, J.L., (2002) Nitrate and Man: Toxic, Harmless Or Beneficial, , (CABI UK Publishing, Wallingford, UK); Eriksson, E., Auffarth, K., Henze, M., Ledin, A., Characteristics of grey wastewater (2002) Urban Water, 4, pp. 85-104; (1991), http://eur-lex.europa.eu/, Council directive of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment (91/271/EEC) (European Commission, Luxembourg)http://hppcb.nic.in, General Standards of Himachal Pradesh, India for Discharge Of Environmental Pollutants (HP State Polution Control Board, HP, IndiaNational Primary Drinking Water Regulations, , http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/, (US Environmental Protection Agency, USA); (1996) Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, , http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/, (ADWG) (Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council, Canberra, Australia); (1991) Indian Standard Specifications For Drinking Water, , http://hppcb.nic.in/, IS: 10500, (HP State Polution Control Board, HP, India); Cooper, P., Day, M., Process options for phospho rus and nitrogen removal from wastewater, Water Environ J (1994) 8, pp. 84-92; Verstraete, W., Philips, S., Nitrification-denitrification processes and technologies in new contexts (1998) Environ Pollut, 102, pp. 717-726; von Sperling, M., Comparison among the most frequently used systems for wastewater treatment in developing countries (1996) Water Sci Technol, 33, pp. 59-72; Kivaisi, A.K., The potential for constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment and reuse in developing countries: A review (2001) Ecol Engg, 16, pp. 545-560; Corcoran, E.C.N., Baker, E., Bos, R., Osborn, H.S., (2010) Sick Water?
