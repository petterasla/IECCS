Adding to this problem, greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming are income dependent: people with the highest incomes, both globally and within specific communities, tend to pollute more than those with the lowest incomes. A policy dilemma thus arises when abatement strategies involve regressive financing or when the benefits of such strategies are concentrated within higher-income groups. Low-income communities are in effect subsidizing the pollution abatement of higher-income communities. This paper reviews a range of evidence showing the unequal vulnerabilities, responsibilities, benefits, and costs from climate change and climate change policies. A framework for the evaluation of climate change mitigation strategies in the transportation sector is then proposed. This framework incorporates these equity issues along with other traditional measures of policy effectiveness. Exactly how these various inequities are incorporated and valued is highly case specific and is proposed as the subject of future research.",,"Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Future climate; Global climate changes; Gulf of Mexico; Low-income communities; Pollution abatement; Transportation sector; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sea level; Global warming",,,,,,"Dvorak, P., Bush trip to ne fuels pique: Visit to hydrogen pump angers some residents (2005) Washington Post, pp. B01. , http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/25/ AR2005052501959.html, May 26, Accessed July 31, 2009; Metz, B., Davidson, O.R., Bosch, P.R., Dave, R., Meyer, L.A., (2007) Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change., , http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_wg3_report_mitigation_of_climate_cha nge.htm, Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovern mental Panel on Climate Change, Accessed July 31, 2009; (2009) Fact Sheet: Climate Change and Environmental Justice., , http://www.ejcc.org/assets/climate_change_fact_sheet.pdf, Environmental Justice and Climate Change Initiative, Oakland, Calif, Accessed July 31; (2004) The Impacts of Climate Change on the Vulnerability of the Poor., , http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications/climatechange/ 3vulnerability.pdf, Department for International Development, London, Accessed July 31, 2009; (2004) African Americans and Climate Change: An Unequal Burden, , http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2004/CBCF_REPORT_execsum.pdf, Redefining Progress and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Oakland, Calif, Accessed July 31, 2009; Wadud, Z., Graham, D., Noland, R., Modeling fuel demand for different socioeconomic groups (2007) 86th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board, , Washington, D.C; Shukla, P.R., Justice, equity and efficiency in climate change: A developing country perspective (1999) Fairness Concerns in Climate Change, pp. 145-159. , F.
