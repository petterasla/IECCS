A. veitchii and A. mariesii dominated at the lower and upper parts of the subalpine zone, respectively. Residual chronologies of tree-ring width and maximum latewood density were developed for the two Abies species at the upper and lower distribution limits, and were compared with monthly mean temperatures and monthly sums of precipitation. Tree-ring widths of the two Abies species at the upper and lower distribution limits positively correlated with temperatures during the beginning of the dormant season and during the growing season of the current year, except for A. veitchii at the lower distribution limit, which showed no positive correlation with temperature. Maximum latewood densities of the two Abies species at the upper and lower distribution limits positively and negatively correlated with temperatures and precipitation, respectively, during the growing season of the current year. Therefore, tree-ring widths and maximum latewood densities of the two Abies species were sensitive to low temperature, except for the tree-ring width of A. veitchii at the lower distribution limit with the warmest thermal conditions along the altitude. Global warming is suggested to affect maximum latewood densities and tree-ring widths of the two Abies species along the altitude. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Abies mariesii; Abies veitchii; Climatic change; Dendrochronology; Ecotone","Abies mariesii; Abies veitchii; Climatic change; Dendrochronology; Ecotone; Climatology; Global warming; Plant extracts; Population distribution; Abies; Abies mariesii; Abies veitchii",,,,,,"Adams, H.D., Kolb, T.E., Tree growth response to drought and temperature in a mountain landscape in northern Arizona, USA (2005) J Biogeogr, 32, pp. 1629-1640; Barber, V.A., Juday, G.P., Finney, B.P., Wilmking, M., Reconstruction of summer temperatures in interior Alaska from tree-ring proxies: evidence for changing synoptic climate regimes (2004) Clim Chang, 63, pp. 91-120; Biondi, F., Waikul, K., DENDROCLIM2002: a C++ program for statistical calibration of climate signals in tree-ring chronologies (2004) Comput Geosci, 30, pp. 303-311; Briffa, K.R., Schweingruber, F.H., Jones, P.D., Osborn, T.J., Shiyatov, S.G., Vaganov, E.A., Reduced sensitivity of recent tree-growth to temperature and high northern latitudes (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 678-682; Buckley, B.M., Cook, E.R., Peterson, M.J., Barbetti, M., A changing temperature response with elevation for Lagarostrobos franklinii in Tasmania, Australia (1997) Clim Chang, 36, pp. 477-498; Carrer, M., Urbinati, C., Age-dependent tree-ring growth responses to climate in Larix decidua and Pinus cembra (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 730-740; Cook, E.R., (1985) A time series analysis approach to tree ring standardization, , PhD thesis, Univ Arizona, Tucson; Cook, E.R., Peters, K., The smoothing spline: a new approach to standardizing forest interior tree-ring width series for dendroclimatic studies (1981) Tree-Ring Bull, 41, pp. 45-53; Cullen, L.E., Palmer, J.G., Duncan, R.P., Stewart, G.H., Climate change and tree-ring relationships of Nothofagus menziesii tree-line forests (2001) Can J For Res, 31, pp. 1981-1991; Eshete, G., Ståhl, G., Tree rings as indicators of growth periodicity of acacias in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia (1999) For Ecol Manage, 116, pp. 107-117; Fan, Z.X., Brauning, A., Cao, K.F., Zhu, S.D., Growth-climate responses of high-elevation conifers in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China (2009) For Ecol Manage, 258, pp. 306-313; Fritts, H.C., (1976) Tree Rings and Climate, , New Jersey: The Blackburn Press; Fujiwara, T., Okada, N., Yamashita, K., Comparison of growth response of Abies and Picea species to climate in Mt.
