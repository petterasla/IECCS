Heat and freshwater fluxes from basal ice shelf melting (ISM) are parameterized following Beckmann and Goosse [Ocean Model 5(2):157-170, 2003]. Melting sensitivities to the oceanic temperature outside of the ice shelf cavities are varied from linear to quadratic (Holland et al. in J Clim 21, 2008). In 1% per year CO2-increase experiments the total freshwater flux from ISM triples to 0.09 Sv in the linear case and more than quadruples to 0.15 Sv in the quadratic case after 140 years at which 4 × 280 ppm = 1,120 ppm was reached. Due to the long response time of subsurface temperature anomalies, ISM thereafter increases drastically, if CO2 concentrations are kept constant at 1,120 ppm. Varying strength of the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC) is crucial for ISM increase, because southward advection of heat dominates the warming along the Antarctic coast. On centennial timescales the ACC accelerates due to deep ocean warming north of the current, caused by mixing of heat along isopycnals in the Southern Ocean (SO) outcropping regions. In contrast to previous studies we find an initial weakening of the ACC during the first 150 years of warming. This purely baroclinic effect is due to a freshening in the SO which is consistent with present observations. Comparison with simulations with diagnosed ISM but without its influence on the ocean circulation reveal a number of ISM-related feedbacks, of which a negative ISM-feedback, due to the ISM-related local oceanic cooling, is the dominant one. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,"basal ice; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; global warming; heat flux; ice shelf; ice-ocean interaction; oceanic circulation; parameterization; sea surface temperature; temperature anomaly; Antarctic Circumpolar Current; Antarctica; Southern Ocean",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Clark, P.U., Huybrechts, P., Joughin, I., Ice-sheet and sea-level changes (2005) Science, 310, pp. 456-460. , doi:10.1126/science.1114613; Beckmann, A., Goosse, H., A parametrization of ice shelf-ocean interaction for climate models (2003) Ocean Model, 5 (2), pp. 157-170; Bi, D., Budd, W.F., Hirst, A.C., Wu, X., Response of the Antarctic circumpolar current transport to global warming in a coupled model (2002) Geophys Res Lett, 29 (24), pp. 3927-3930; Borowski, D., Gerdes, R., Olbers, D., Thermohaline and wind forcing of a circumpolar channel with blocked geostrophic contours (2002) J Phys Oceanogr, 32, pp. 2520-2539; England, M., Representing the global-scale water masses in ocean general circulation models (1993) J Phys Oceanogr, 23, pp. 1523-1552; Fichefet, T., Maqueda, M.A.M., Sensitivity of a global sea ice model to the treatment of ice thermodynamics and dynamics (1997) J Geophys Res, 102, pp. 12609-12646; Fyfe, J.C., Saenko, O.A., Simulated changes in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere winds and currents (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L06701. , doi:10.1029/2005GL025332; Garabato, A.C.N., Stevens, D.P., Watson, A.J., Roether, W., Short-circuiting of the overturning circulation in the Antarctic circumpolar current (2007) Nature, 447, pp. 194-197. , doi:10.1038/nature05832; Gent, P.R., McWilliams, J.C., Isopycnal mixing in ocean circulation models (1990) J Phys Oceanogr, 20, pp. 150-155; Gent, P.R., Large, W.G., Bryan, F.O., What sets the mean transport through drake passage?
