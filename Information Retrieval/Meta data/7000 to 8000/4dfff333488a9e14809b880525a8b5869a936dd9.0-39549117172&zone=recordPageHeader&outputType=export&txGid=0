The analysis with respect to carbon emission control and nuclear fissile transaction among regions indicates the need of coordinated further developments of energy conservation, renewable and nuclear energies, and rather drastic nuclear introduction in the presently developing world. The analysis also suggests the need of long-term planning and R&D efforts under the wisdom. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
