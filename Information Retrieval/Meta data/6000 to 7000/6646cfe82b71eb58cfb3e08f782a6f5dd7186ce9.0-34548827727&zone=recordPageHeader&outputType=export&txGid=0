Hardin's paper will be in looked at in view of both anthropogenic global warming and peak oil and some of the solutions he posed for the ""population problem"" applied to the post-peak era. Possible solutions are compared with the Kyoto Protocol for global warming and the Rimini Protocol for peak oil. A carbon-indexed, universal tax on non-renewable energy resources 'Unitax' is mooted as a longer-term possibility to overcoming both global warming and the financing of post-peak oil problems. Alas, the process of dealing with global warming and peak oil seems to be falling into the ""no technical solution"" category that Hardin identified for population. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
