Annual inputs of C to the upper part of the soil profile averaged 7 and 3 t ha-1 for the forest and grassland soils, respectively. Turnover times for decomposable C [(total C - inert C)/annual C input] in the topsoil ranged from 11 to 40 yr, and were closely related to mean annual temperatures. -from Authors",,"afforestation; carbon dioxide; forest; global carbon cycle; grassland; New Zealand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03050270,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029478153
