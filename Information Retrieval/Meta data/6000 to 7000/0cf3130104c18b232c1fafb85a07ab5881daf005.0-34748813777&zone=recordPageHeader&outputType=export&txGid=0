Such alterations in community composition must be underlain by changes in the population dynamics of component species. • Here, the impact of elevated CO2 (550 μmol mol -1) and warming (+2°C) on the population growth of four plant species important in Australian temperate grasslands is reported. Data collected from the Tasmanian free-air CO2 enrichment (TasFACE) experiment between 2003 and 2006 were analysed using population matrix models. • Population growth of Themeda triandra, a perennial C4 grass, was largely unaffected by either factor but population growth of Austrodanthonia caespitosa, a perennial C3 grass, was reduced substantially in elevated CO2 plots. Warming and elevated CO2 had antagonistic effects on population growth of two invasive weeds, Hypochaeris radicata and Leontodon taraxacoides, with warming causing population decline. Analysis of life cycle stages showed that seed production, seedling emergence and establishment were important factors in the responses of the species to global changes. • These results show that the demographic approach is very useful in understanding the variable responses of plants to global changes and in elucidating the life cycle stages that are most responsive. © The Authors (2007).","Climate change; Demography; Elevated CO2; Free-air CO2 enrichment; Global warming; Grassland; Life table response experiment; Population matrix models","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; climate change; community composition; community structure; demography; global warming; grassland; life cycle; nutrient enrichment; plant community; population decline; population dynamics; population growth; population modeling; seed production; seedling emergence; weed; acclimatization; article; Australia; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Poaceae; population density; population dynamics; Acclimatization; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Poaceae; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Tasmania; Australasia; Australia; Austrodanthonia; Hypochaeris radicata; Leontodon taraxacoides; Themeda triandra",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Abu-Asab, M.S., Peterson, P.M., Shetler, S.G., Orli, S.S., Earlier plant flowering in spring as a response to global warming in the Washington, DC, area (2001) Biodiversity and Conservation, 10, pp. 597-612; Aerts, R., Cornelissen, J.H.C., Dorrepaal, E., Plant performance in a warmer world: General responses of plants from cold, northern biomes and the importance of winter and spring events (2006) Plant Ecology, 182, pp. 65-77; Ball, A.S., Drake, B.G., Short-term decomposition of litter produced by plants grown in elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (1997) Global Change Biology, 3, pp. 29-35; Belsky, A.J., Effects of grazing, competition, disturbance and fire on species composition and diversity in grassland communities (1992) Journal of Vegetation Science, 3, pp. 187-200; Bowes, G., Facing the inevitable: Plants and increasing atmospheric CO2 (1993) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology, 44, pp. 309-332; Brooker, R.W., Plant-plant interactions and environmental change (2006) New Phytologist, 171, pp. 271-284; Brys, R., Jacquemyn, H., Endels, P., De Blust, G., Hermy, M., The effects of grassland management on plant performance and demography in the perennial herb Primula veris (2004) Journal of Applied Ecology, 41, pp. 1080-1091; Bunce, J.A., Seed yield of soybeans with daytime or continuous elevation of carbon dioxide under field conditions (2005) Photosynthetica, 43, pp. 435-438; Von Caemmerer, S., (2000) Biochemical Models of Leaf Photosynthesis., , Melbourne, Australia: CSIRO; Campell, B.D., Stafford Smith, D.M., A synthesis of recent global change research on pasture and rangeland production: Reduced uncertainties and their management implications (2000) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 82, pp. 39-55; Caswell, H., (2001) Matrix Population Models., , Sunderland, MA, USA: Sinauer; Chapin, F.S., Zavaleta, E.S., Eviner, V.T., Naylor, R.L., Vitousek, P.M., Reynolds, H.L., Hooper, D.U., Diaz, S., Consequences of changing biodiversity (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 234-242; Coleman, J.S., Bazzaz, F.A., Effects of CO2 and temperature on growth and resource use of co-occurring C3 and C4 annuals (1992) Ecology, 73, pp. 1244-1259; Edwards, G.R., Clark, H., Newton, P.C.D., The effects of elevated CO2 on seed production and seedling recruitment in a sheep-grazed pasture (2001) Oecologia, 127, pp. 383-394; Edwards, G.R., Hay, M.J.M., Brock, J.L., Seedling recruitment dynamics of forage and weed species under continuous and rotational sheep grazing in a temperate New Zealand pasture (2005) Grass and Forage Science, 60, pp. 186-199; Ehleringer, J.R., Cerling, T.E., Helliker, B.R., C4 photosynthesis, atmospheric CO2 and climate (1997) Oecologia, 112, pp. 285-299; Fréville, H., Silvertown, J., Analysis of interspecific competition in perennial plants using life table response experiments (2005) Plant Ecology, 176, pp. 69-78; Garden, D.L., Waters, C.M., Smith, A.B., Norton, M.R., Auricht, G.C., Kobelt, E., Performance of native and introduced grasses for low-input pastures. 2.
