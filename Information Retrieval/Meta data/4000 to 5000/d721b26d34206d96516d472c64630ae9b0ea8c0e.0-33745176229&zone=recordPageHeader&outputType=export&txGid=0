To assess this issue, we examined temporal change in the morphology of the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus), a small, abundant woodland salamander distributed widely in eastern North America with two distinct morphotypes: striped individuals associated with cooler microclimates and unstriped individuals associated with warmer microclimates. We compiled morph frequencies for 50,960 individual salamanders from 558 sites as recorded in the published literature and in unpublished field notes of herpetologists between 1908 and 2004. We observed that striping probability increased with increasing latitude, longitude, and elevation and decreased (from 80% to 74% range wide) with time. The combined forces of regional climate warming and, particularly, forest disturbance have evidently been sufficient to cause morphological evolution in this amphibian over the last century. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Amphibians; Climate change; Evolution; Forest disturbance; Morphology; Plethodon cinereus","amphibian; climate change; evolution; forest clearance; morphology; phenotypic plasticity; warming; animal; article; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; histology; North America; salamander; tree; Animals; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; North America; Salamandridae; Trees; North America; Amphibia; Plethodon; Plethodon cinereus; Salamandroidea",,,,,,"Beebee, T.J.C., Amphibian breeding and climate (1995) Nature, 374, pp. 219-220; Bishop, S.C., The salamanders of New York (1941) New York State Museum Bulletin, p. 324; Blaustein, A.R., Belden, L.K., Olson, D.H., Green, D.M., Root, T.L., Kiesecker, J.M., Amphibian breeding and climate change (2001) Conservation Biology, 15, pp. 1804-1809. , and; Burger, J.W., Plethodon cinereus (Green) in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey (1935) The American Naturalist, 69, pp. 578-586; Carey, C., Alexander, M.A., Climate change and amphibian declines: Is there a link?
