An important example of a normative target is to limit the global-mean temperature change to a certain maximum. In general, reported cost estimates for limiting global warming often rise rapidly, even exponentially, as the scale of emission reductions from a reference level increases. This rapid rise may suggest that more ambitious policies may be prohibitively expensive. Here, we propose a probabilistic perspective, focused on the relationship between mitigation costs and the likelihood of achieving a climate target. We investigate the qualitative, functional relationship between the likelihood of achieving a normative target and the costs of climate-change mitigation. In contrast to the example of exponentially rising costs for lowering concentration levels, we show that the mitigation costs rise proportionally to the likelihood of meeting a temperature target, across a range of concentration levels. In economic terms investing in climate mitigation to increase the probability of achieving climate targets yields ""constant returns to scale,"" because of a counterbalancing rapid rise in the probabilities of meeting a temperature target as concentration is lowered. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Abatement costs; Climate targets; Mitigation; Probabilistic framework; Risk approach","air temperature; article; climate change; greenhouse effect; priority journal; probability; risk factor; temperature",,,,,,"Stern, N., (2006) The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review, , Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Nordhaus, W.D., (2007) The Challenge of Global Warming: Economic Models and Environmental Policy, , Yale University, New Haven, CT; Azar, C., Lindgren, K., Catastrophic events and stochastic cost-benefit analysis of climate change (2003) Climatic Change, 56, pp. 245-255; Rayner, S., Malone, E., (1998) Human Choice and Climate Change, , Batelle, Columbus, OH; Hof, A.F., den Elzen, M.G.J., van Vuuren, D.P., Analyzing the costs and benefits of climate policy: Value judgements and scientific uncertainties (2008) Global Environ Change, , 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.04.004; Mastrandrea, M.D., Schneider, S.H., Integrated assessment of abrupt climatic changes (2001) Climate Policy, 1, pp. 433-449; Tol, R.S.J., Is the uncertainty about climate change too large for expected cost-benefit analysis?
