The CCS chain modeled in this study consists of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from flue gas using monoethanolamine (MEA), pipeline transport and storage in a saline aquifer. Results show that the sequestration of 90% CO2 from the flue gas results in avoiding 70% of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere per kWh and reduces global warming potential (GWP) by 64%. Calculation of other environmental impacts shows the trade-offs: an increase of 43% in acidification, 35% in eutrophication, and 120-170% in various toxicity impacts. Given the assumptions employed in this analysis, emissions of MEA and formaldehyde during capture process and generation of reclaimer wastes contributes to various toxicity potentials and cause many-fold increase in the on-site direct freshwater ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity impacts. NOx from fuel combustion is still the dominant contributor to most direct impacts, other than toxicity potentials and GWP. It is found that the direct emission of MEA contribute little to human toxicity (HT&lt;1%), however it makes 16% of terrestrial ecotoxicity impact. Hazardous reclaimer waste causes significant freshwater and marine ecotoxicity impacts. Most increases in impact are due to increased fuel requirements or increased investments and operating inputs. The reductions in GWP range from 58% to 68% for the worst-case to best-case CCS system. Acidification, eutrophication and toxicity potentials show an even large range of variation in the sensitivity analysis. Decreases in energy use and solvent degradation will significantly reduce the impact in all categories. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Life cycle assessment; Natural gas combined cycle; Structural path analysis","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Direct emissions; Direct impact; Ecotoxicity; Electricity generation; Energy use; Fuel combustion; Fuel requirements; Global warming potential; Human toxicity; Life cycle assessment; Life-cycle assessments; Monoethanolamine; Natural gas combined cycle; Natural gas combined cycles; Pipeline transport; Post-combustion; Saline aquifers; Structural path analysis; Toxicity potential; Acidification; Air pollution; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Electric generators; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Flue gases; Fuels; Gases; Global warming; Investments; Natural gas; Rating; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Toxicity; Waste incineration; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combustion; environmental impact; eutrophication; hazardous waste; life cycle analysis; natural gas; sensitivity analysis; toxicity; transport process; waste management",,,,,,"Aarrestad, P.R., Gjershaug, J.O., Effects on terrestrial vegetation, soil and fauna of amines and possible degradation products relevant for CO2 capture.
