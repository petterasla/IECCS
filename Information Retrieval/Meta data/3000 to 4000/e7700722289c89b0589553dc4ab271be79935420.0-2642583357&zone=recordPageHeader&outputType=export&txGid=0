Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climates. Here we report results of a large-scale (1ha) throughfall exclusion experiment conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santarém, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions by &gt;40% and increased rates of consumption of atmospheric CH4 by a factor of &gt;4. No treatment effect has yet been detected for NO and CO2 fluxes. The responses of these microbial processes after three rainy seasons of the exclusion treatment are characteristic of a direct effect of soil aeration on denitrification, methanogenesis, and methanotrophy. An anticipated second phase response, in which drought-induced plant mortality is followed by increased mineralization of C and N substrates from dead fine roots and by increased foraging of termites on dead coarse roots, has not yet been detected. Analyses of depth profiles of N2O and CO2 concentrations with a diffusivity model revealed that the top 25 cm soil is the site of most of the wet season production of N2O, whereas significant CO2 production occurs down to 100 cm in both seasons, and small production of CO2 occurs to at least 1100cm depth. The diffusivity-based estimates of CO2 production as a function of depth were strongly correlated with fine root biomass, indicating that trends in belowground C allocation may be inferred from monitoring and modeling profiles of H2O and CO2. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazon Basin; Brazil; CH4; Climate change; CO2; N2O; Nitrogen,NO; Soil carbon","carbon dioxide; drought; methane; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; soil emission; tropical forest; Brazil; Para [Brazil]; South America; Isoptera",,,,,,"Andreae, M.O., Rosenfeld, D., Artaxo, P., Smoking rain clouds over the Amazon (2004) Science, , in press; Cattânio, J.H., Davidson, E.A., Nepstad, D.C., Effects of rainfall exclusion on soil emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, and NO in eastern Amazonia (2002) Biology and Fertility of Soil, 36, pp. 102-108; Clapperton, C., (1993) Quaternary Geology of South America, , Elsevier Science, New York; Costa, M.H., Foley, J.A., Combined effects of deforestation and doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the climate of Amazonia (2000) Journal of Climate, 13, pp. 18-34; Davidson, E.A., Bustamante, M.M.C., Pinto, A.S., Emissions of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from soils of native and exotic ecosystems of the Amazon and Cerrado regions of Brazil (2001) Optimizing Nitrogen Management in Food and Energy Production and Environmental Protection: Proceedings of the Second International Nitrogen Conference on Science and Policy, pp. 312-319. , (eds Galloway J, Cowling E, Erisman J, Wisniewski J, Jordan C) A.A.
