Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used in conducting this comparison. Central systems have a longer lifetime than individual systems, lower electricity consumption and maintenance requirements during the use phase, and a higher recycling potential during the disposal phase. However, to transfer cool air, central systems use a large quantity of water pipes or air ducts, the production of which contributes significantly to resource use. The LCA study reveals that, on the whole, the central systems generally use less resources than split systems and result in lower environmental impacts. The paper suggests a need for producers of air-conditioners to consider a change from being suppliers of air-conditioning hardware to being suppliers of cool air in order to overcome the initial cost constraints of central systems and realize their environmental and economic improvement potential to the benefit of the environment, and the industry as well as customers.","Air-conditioning; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle assessment; Resource use","air conditioning; energy use; life cycle analysis; recycling; waste disposal",,,,,,"Althof, J., Smithart, E., Sidebottom, J., The HVAC response to the energy challenge (2001) ASHRAE Journal, 43 (5), pp. 40-42; Ciantar, C., Hadfield, M., An environmental evaluation of mechanical systems using environmentally acceptable refrigerants (2000) Int J LCA, 5 (4), pp. 209-220; Crowther, H.F., Ozone-depleting substances (2001) ASHRAE Journal, 43 (3), p. 68; Hawken, P., Lovins, A., Lovins, L.H., (1999) Natural Capitalism.
