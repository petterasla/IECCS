Calculated data are presented on crop productivity of grain crops and grasses (C3) under arid and humid scenarios of climate taking account of one-, two-, three and four-factor natural environment impacts. All four factors under studies (climatic parameters, CO2 and tropospheric ozone concentrations, soil degradation extent) greatly impact agriculture productivity. The effect of interaction between all considered factors on agroecosystem productivity is studied. It is established that a simple additive scheme for explaining the complex effect of some factors can be much violated. In this case, not only variations in the mean crop yield levels but also variations in the degree of crop stability have been assessed in some regions, that may be more important for determining the social-economic consequences. It turned out that the recurrence of critically very low yields in steppe regions may increase two fold as a result of global warming.",,"Poaceae; agricultural impact; agriculture; carbon dioxide; climate change; crop yield; global warming; ozone concentration; soil fertility; Russian Federation",,,,,,"Abashina, E.V., Sirotenko, O.D., Applied Dynamic Model Forming the Yield for Simulation System of the Agrometeorological Provision of the Agriculture (1986) Collect Works ARRIAM, 21, pp. 13-33; Adams, R.M., Fleming, R.A., Chang, C.C., McCarl, B.A., Rozenzweig, C., A Reassessment of the Economic Effects of Global Climate Change on U.S. Agriculture (1995) Clim.
