A report to the World Glacier Monitoring Services in Zurich, Switzerland, stated that of the 88 glaciers surveyed in 2002 and 2003, only four were growing and at least 79 were receding. If the ice loss was entirely due to less snowfall, it should have slowed or reversed after 1960, when the weather became wetter again. The 2001 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that the melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps will raise sea levels by upto 0.23 meters by 2100.",,"Condition monitoring; Glaciers; Ice; Sea level; Snow; Surveying; Ice caps; Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC); Mountain glaciers; Global warming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,02624079,,NWSCA,,"English","New Sci.",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-24344467517
