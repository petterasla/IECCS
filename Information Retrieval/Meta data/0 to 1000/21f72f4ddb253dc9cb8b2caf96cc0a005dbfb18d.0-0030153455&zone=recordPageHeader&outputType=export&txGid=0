High on the list of both these concerns is the rapid destruction of tropical forests and their release of greenhouse gases in the process. Much of the forest destruction is to provide lumber for building construction worldwide, and for fuelwood, but most of it is to provide land for agriculture.","Atmospheric pollution; Forest destruction; Global warming; Slash-and-burn","atmospheric pollution; climate change; global warming; greenhouse gas; rainforest destruction; slash and burn agriculture",,,,,,"Andreae, M.O., Biomass burning: Its history, use and distribution, and its impact on environmental quality and global climate (1991) Global Burning: Atmospheric, Climatic and Biospheric Implications, pp. 3-21. , J.S.
