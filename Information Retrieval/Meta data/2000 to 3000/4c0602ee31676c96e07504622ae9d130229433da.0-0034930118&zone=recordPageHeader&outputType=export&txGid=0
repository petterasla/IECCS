Warmer temperatures during the 20th century have been accompanied by a reduction in day-to-day variability, particularly for minimum temperatures and for winter. There is a significant negative correlation between day-to-day variability and the skewness of the temperature distribution, particularly in winter and for minimum temperatures. Lower variability is linked to a reduced number of cold days and nights. Higher NAO index values tend to be associated not only with warmer temperatures but also with lower day-to-day variability. This paper confirms that the temperature warming during the 20th century has happened mainly through the loss of the coldest part of the series, not only in the 24-hour or yearly cycle, but also through the loss of the coldest episodes in each month.",,"climate variation; diel variation; diurnal variation; temperature anomaly; twentieth century; Switzerland",,,,,,"Hansen, J., Sato, M., Ruedy, R., Long-term changes of the diurnal temperature cycle: Implications about mechanisms of global climate change (1995) J Atmos Res, 37, pp. 175-209; Hansen, J., Sato, M., Lacis, A., Ruedy, R., The missing climate forcing (1997) Phil Trans R Soc Lond B, 352, pp. 231-240; Hansen, J., Sato, M., Ruedy, R., Radiative forcing and climate response (1997) J Geophys Res, 102 (6 D), pp. 6831-6864; Heino, R., Brźdil, R., Forland, E., Tuomenvirta, H., Alexandersson, H., Beniston, M., Pfister, C., Wibig, J., Progress in the study of climatic extremes in Northern and Central Europe (1999) Clim Change, 42, pp. 151-181; Hurrell, J.W., Decadal trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation: Regional temperatures and precipitation (1995) Science, 269, pp. 676-679; Hurrell, J.W., Influence of variations in extratropical wintertime teleconnections on Northern Hemisphere temperatures (1996) Geophys Res Lett, 23, pp. 665-668; Hurrell, J.W., van Loon, H., Decadal variations in climate associated with the North Atlantic oscillation (1997) Clim Change, 36, pp. 301-326; Climate Change (1995) The IPCC Second Assessment Report, , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Jones, P.D., Horton, E.B., Folland, C.K., Hulme, M., Parker, D.E., Basnett, T.A., The use of indices to identify changes in climatic extremes (1999) Clim Change, 42, pp. 131-149; Jungo, P., (2001) Homogeneity Analysis of Seven Century-long Swiss Temperature Series, , In preparation; Karl, T., Jones, P., Knight, R., Kukla, G., Plummer, N., Razuvayev, V., Gallo, K., Peterson, T., A new perspective on recent global warming: Asymetric trends of daily maximum and minimum temperature (1993) Bull AMS, 74 (6), pp. 1007-1023; Karl, T.R., Knight, R.W., Plummer, N., Trends in high-frequency climate variability in the twentieth century (1995) Nature, 377, pp. 217-220; Karl, T.R., Nicholls, N., Ghazi, A., CLIVAR/GCOS/ WMO workshop on indices and indicators for climate extremes, workshop summary (1999) Clim Change, 42, pp. 3-7; Katz, R.W., Brown, B.G., Extreme events in a changing climate: Variability is more important than averages (1992) Clim Change, 21, pp. 289-302; Lough, J.M., Regional indices of climate variation: Temperature and rainfall in Queensland, Australia (1997) Int J Climatology, 17 (1), pp. 55-66; Luterbacher, J., Schmutz, C., Gyalistras, D., Xoplaki, E., Wanner, H., Reconstruction of monthly NAO and EU indices back to AD 1675 (1999) Geophys Res Lett, 26, pp. 2745-2748; Moberg, A., Jones, P.D., Barriendos, M., Bergstöm, H., Camuffo, D., Cocheo, C., Davies, T.D., Verhoeve, T., Day-to-day temperature variability trends in 160-to-275-year long European instrumental records (2000) J Geoph Res - Atmospheres, , in press; Plummer, N., Temperature variability and extremes over Australia recent observed changes (1996) Austral Meteorol Mag, 45 (4), pp. 233-250; Rebetez, M., Public expectation as an element of human perception of climate change (1996) Clim Change, 32, pp. 495-509; Rebetez, M., Twentieth century trends in droughts in southern Switzerland (1999) Geophys Res Lett, 26, pp. 755-758; Rebetez, M., Beniston, M., Changes in temperature variability in relation to shifts in mean temperatures in the Alpine region this century (1998) Past, Present and Future Climate Variability and Extremes: The Impact on Forests, , Beniston M, Innes J (eds).
