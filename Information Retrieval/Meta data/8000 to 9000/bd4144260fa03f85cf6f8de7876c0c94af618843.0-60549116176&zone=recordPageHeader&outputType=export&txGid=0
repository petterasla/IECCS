Carbon dioxide (CO2,) is a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas and its increase is thought to give rise to the recent global warming. Although studies suggested the impact of population growth on carbon dioxide increase, much attention has not been paid. In this study population was plotted as compared to the atmospheric CO2 concentration. A quite linear relationship was observed between population and CO2 concentration at both before and after 1970, after which the global temperature rapidly increased. In addition, direct and indirect human-derived CO2 emission appeared to contribute much to the total amount of CO2 emission in developing countries and as the economy grow fossil-fuel-derived CO2 emission increased more as compared to human-derived emission. These findings indicate that population growth especially in developing countries is a critical factor for manipulation of global CO2 increase.","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Population","carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; air pollution; article; climate change; developed country; economic aspect; field emission; greenhouse effect; risk factor; temperature sensitivity",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Le Treut, H., Somerville, R., Cubasch, U., Ding, Y., Mauritzen, C., Mokssit, A., Peterson, T and Prather, M.
