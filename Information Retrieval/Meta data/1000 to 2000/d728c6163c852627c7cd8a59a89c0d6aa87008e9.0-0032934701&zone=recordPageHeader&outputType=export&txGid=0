Knowledge of functional root responses may be particularly important in ecosystems where water is limiting if predictions about global climate change are true. In this study we investigated the effect of elevated CO2 on the root hydraulic conductivity (L(p)) of a C3 perennial, Larrea tridentata, and a C3 annual, Helianthus annuus. The plants were grown in a glasshouse under ambient (360 μmol mol-1) and elevated (700 μmol mol-1) CO2. The L(p) through intact root systems was measured using a hydrostatic pressure-induced flow system. Leaf gas exchange was also determined for both species and leaf water potential (ψ(leaf)) was determined in L. tridentata. The L(p) of L. tridentata roots was unchanged by an elevated CO2 growth environment. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) and transpiration (E) decreased and photosynthetic rate (A(net)) and ψ(leaf) increased in L. tridentata. There were no changes in biomass, leaf area, stem diameter or root: shoot (R : S) ratio for L. tridentata. In H. annuus, elevated CO2 induced a nearly two-fold decrease in root L(p). There was no effect of growth under elevated CO2 on A(net), g(s), E, above-and below-ground dry mass, R:S ratio, leaf area, root length or stem diameter in this species. The results demonstrate that rising atmospheric CO2 can impact water uptake and transport in roots in a species-specific manner. Possible mechanisms for the observed decrease in root L(p) in H. annuus under elevated CO2 are currently under investigation and may relate to either axial or radial components of root L(p).","Carbon dioxide; Functional root responses; Helianthus annuus; Hydraulic conductivity; Larrea tridentata; Water uptake","carbon dioxide enrichment; hydraulic conductivity; root; Helianthus annuus; Larrea tridentata",,,,,,"BassiriRad, H., Reynolds, J.F., Virginia, R.A., Brunelle, M.H., Growth and root NO- 3 and PO3- 4 uptake capacity of three desert species in response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment (1997) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 24, pp. 353-358; BassiriRad, H., Thomas, R.B., Reynolds, J.F., Strain, B.R., Differential responses of root uptake kinetics of NH+ 4 and NO- 3 to enriched atmospheric CO2 in field-grown loblolly pine (1996) Plant, Cell and Environment, 19, pp. 367-371; Bazzaz, F.A., The response of natural ecosystems to rising global CO2 levels (1990) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 21, pp. 167-196; Berntson, G., Bazzaz, F., Belowground positive and negative feedbacks on CO2 growth enhancement (1996) Plant and Soil, 187, pp. 119-131; Bunce, J., Growth at elevated carbon dioxide concentrations reduces hydraulic conductance in alfalfa and soybean (1996) Global Change Biology, 2, pp. 155-158; Carlson, R.W., Bazzaz, F., The effects of elevated CO2 concentration on growth, photosynthesis, transpiration, and water use efficiency of plants (1980) Environmental and Climatic Impact of Coal Utilization, pp. 609-622. , eds J.J.
