The amount of CO2-C emitted into the atmosphere is estimated at 136 ± 55 Pg from terrestrial ecosystems, of which emission from world soils is estimated at 78 ± 12 Pg. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems decreases soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by 30-50% over 50-100 years in temperate regions, and 50-75% over 20-50 years in tropical climates. The projected global warming, with estimated increase in mean annual temperature of 4-6°C by 2100, may have a profound impact on the total soil C pool and its dynamics. The SOC pool may increase due to increase in biomass production and accretion into the soil due to the so-called ""CO2 fertilization effect"", which may also enhance production of the root biomass. Increase in weathering of silicates due to increase in temperature, and that of the formation of secondary carbonates due to increase in partial pressure of CO2 in soil air may also increase the total C pool. In contrast, however, SOC pool may decrease because of: (i) increase in rate of respiration and mineralization, (ii) increase in losses by soil erosion, and (iii) decrease in protective effects of stable aggregates which encapsulate organic matter. Furthermore, the relative increase in temperature projected to be more in arctic and boreal regions, will render Cryosols under permafrost from a net sink to a net source of CO2 if and when permafrost thaws. Thus, SOC pool of world soils may decrease with increase in mean global temperature. In contrast, the biotic pool may increase primarily because of the CO2 fertilization effect. The magnitude of CO2 fertilization effect may be constrained by lack of essential nutrients (e.g., N, P) and water. The potential of SOC sequestration in agricultural soils of Europe is 70-190 Tg C yr-1. This potential is realizable through adoption of recommended land use and management, and restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems including wetlands. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","CO2 fertilization effect; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Soil carbon dynamics; Soil carbon sequestration","agricultural ecosystem; biomass; carbon dioxide; ecoregion; fertilizer application; global warming; land management; land use; soil carbon; soil organic matter; terrestrial ecosystem",,,,,,"Agren, G.I., Hyvonen, R., Changes in carbon stores in Swedish forest soils due to increased biomass harvest and increased temperatures analysed with a semi-empirical model (2003) For Ecol Manage, 174, pp. 25-37; Andren, O., Katterer, T., Karlsson, T., ICBM regional mode for estimations of dynamics of agricultural soil carbon pools (2004) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 70, pp. 231-239; Arnalds O.́, Gudbergsson, G., Gudmundsson, J., Carbon sequestration and reclamation of severely degraded soils of Iceland (2000) Icel Agr Ju, 13, pp. 87-97; Berzseny, Z., Gyrffy, B., Effect of crop rotation and fertilization on maize and wheat yield stability in long-term experiments (1997) Agrok Mas Talajtan, 46, pp. 377-398; Bottner, P., Coûteaux, M.M., Vallejo, V.R., Moreno, J.M., Oechel, W.C., Soil organic matter in Mediterranean-type ecosystems and global climate changes: A case study - The soils of the Mediterranean Basin (1995) Global Change and Mediterranean Type Ecosystems, pp. 306-325. , Springer-Verlag New York; Bouma, J., Varallyay, G., Batjes, N.H., Principal land use changes anticipated in Europe (1998) Agric Ecosyst Env, 67, pp. 103-119; Buckland, S.M., Thompson, K., Hodgson, J.G., Grime, J.P., Grassland invasions: Effects of manipulations of climate and management (2001) J Appl Ecol, 38, pp. 301-309; Callesen, I., Liski, J., Raulund-Rasmussen, K., Olsson, M.T., Tau-Strand, L., Veserdal, L., Westman, C.J., Soil carbons stores in Nordic well-drained forest soils-relationships with climate and texture class (2003) Glob Chang Biol, 9, pp. 358-370; Cheddadi, R., Guiot, J., Jolly, D., The Mediterranean vegetation: What if the atmospheric CO2 increased?
