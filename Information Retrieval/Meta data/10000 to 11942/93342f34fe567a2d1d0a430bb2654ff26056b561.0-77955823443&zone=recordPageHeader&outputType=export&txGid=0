Here, we experimentally investigated the effects of summer warming on the biomass production and clonal growth of potted Leymus chinensis in a phytotron. Summer warming significantly decreased the biomass of both parent and daughter shoots, slightly increased the belowground biomass, and lead to a significant increase in root:shoot ratio. Warming significantly increased the total belowground bud number and decreased the daughter shoot number. Importantly, the proportions of each type of bud changed; vertical apical rhizome buds decreased, while horizontal rhizome buds increased in number. The change in proportions of each type of bud is closely related to the decrease in daughter shoot number, rhizome number and length, as well as the decrease in aboveground biomass and increase in belowground biomass. These results indicate that, as a rhizomatous, perennial grass, L. chinensis adopts a selective growth strategy that reduces the energy allocated to aboveground growth and emphasises the development of belowground organs. The implication is that continued summer warming, will further reduce the aboveground biomass production of temperate grasslands dominated by rhizomatous, perennial grasses. Inevitably, species that depend on these grasses for forage will suffer should global climate warming continue. © 2010 CSIRO.","biomass production; bud bank; clone growth; Leymus chinensis; summer warming.","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; bud; clonal growth; forage; global warming; grass; grassland; perennial plant; primary production; rhizome; temperate environment",,,,,,"Aber, J.D., Melillo, J.M., (1991) Terrestrial Ecosystems, , (Saunders College Publishing: Philadelphia, PA); Alward, R.D., Detling, J.K., Milchunas, D.G., Grassland vegetation changes and nocturnal global warming (1999) Science, 283 (5399), pp. 229-231. , DOI 10.1126/science.283.5399.229; Baldocchi, D.D., Falge, E., Gu, L., Olson, R., Hollinger, D., Running, S., Anthoni, P., Wofsy, S., Fluxnet: A new tool to study the temporal and spatial variability of the ecosystem-scale carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy flux densities (2001) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 82, pp. 2415-2434. , doi:10.1175/1520-0477(2001) 082<2415:FANTTS>2.3.CO;2; Bao, S.D., (2000) Soil-agricultural Chemistry Analysis Methods, pp. 42-58. , (China Agriculture Press: Beijing); Benson, E.J., Hartnett, D.C., The role of seed and vegetative reproduction in plant recruitment and demography in tallgrass prairie (2006) Plant Ecology, 187 (2), pp. 163-177. , DOI 10.1007/s11258-005-0975-y; Benson, E.J., Hartnett, D.C., Mann, K.H., Belowground bud banks and meristem limitation in tallgrass prairie plant populations (2004) American Journal of Botany, 91, pp. 416-421. , doi:10.3732/ajb.91.3.416; Bond, W.J., Midgley, J.J., Ecology of sprouting in woody plants: The persistence niche (2001) Trends in Ecology Evolution, 16, pp. 45-51. , doi:10.1016/S0169-5347 (00) 02033-2034; Chaves, M.M., Pereira, J.S., Maroco, J., Rodrigues, M.L., Ricardo, C.P.P., Osorio, M.L., Carvalho, I., Pinheiro, C., How plants cope with water stress in the field.
