The primary document governing water resource planning and evaluation today is the Principles and Guidelines (P and G) adopted by the Water Resource Council in 1983. The issue is whether the P and G and related planning rules needs to be revised with regard to discounting and the choice of the discount rate in response to changing conditions associated with potential climate change and in light of the chapter on intertemporal equity, discounting, and economic efficiency from the report by the IPCC (IPCC, 1996c, ch. 4). Section 2 lays out the basic methodology of cost-benefit analysis and traces the development of issues pertaining to the choice of the discount rate. It is important to consider the discount rate issue in the context of the theoretical foundations of cost-benefit analysis and in particular, the Kaldor-Hicks compensation test. Section 3 sets out what the IPCC chapter on discounting (IPCC, 1996c, ch. 4) describes as the descriptive approach versus the prescriptive approach to choosing a discount rate. It examines the rationales which economists use to support the argument that the discount rate for evaluating public projects should be lower than the marginal rate of return on private investment. It also describes the challenges that using a lower rate poses for the economic evaluation of alternative public projects including water projects. Section 4 addresses the issue of intergenerational equity as it relates to global warming and to discounting and discusses the extent to which issues of intergenerational equity can be accounted for by lowering or raising the discount rate. Section 5 discusses the importance of dynamic flexibility. Section 6 briefly addresses the question of whether the water resources planning process should extend the multiobjective framework to incorporate a full multiobjective criterion function for inclusion in a revised P and G for the future. The final section of the paper sets forth the major conclusions to be drawn from this analysis and from the chapter on intergenerational equity, discounting, and economic efficiency of the IPCC report (IPCC, 1996a ch. 4) for the planning and evaluation procedures in the P and G. Because of the complexity of the outstanding issues regarding the discount rate and of the practical difficulty of applying procedures designed to capture all of these complexities a discounting rule is proposed that this writer believes will improve the overall efficiency of water resource decisions. Whichever procedure described in this paper is finally chosen, the current discounting rule will have to be revised.",,"climate change; project evaluation; water planning; water resource management",,,,,,"Arrow, K.J., Intcrtemporal Equity, Discounting, and Economic Efficiency, , n.d., for Working Group 3, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Cline, W.R., Give Greenhouse Abatement a Fair Chance (1993) Finance and Development, 20 (1), pp. 3-5; Dasgupta, P., Sen, A., Marglin, S.A., Guidelines for Project Evaluation (1972) United Nations Industrial Organization, Formulation and Evaluation Series, (2). , United Nations, New York; Dixit, A.K., Pyndyck, R.S., (1994) Investment under Uncertainty, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Eckstein, O., (1958) Water Resource Development, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Hobbs, B.F., Chao, P.T., Venkatesh, B.W., Using Decision Analysis to Include Climate Change in Water Resources Decision Making (1997) Climatic Change, 37. , this volume; (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change: Contribution of Working Group I to the Second Assessment Report, , Cambridge University Press; (1996) Climate Change 1995: Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation: Contribution of Working Croup II to the Second Assessment Report, , Cambridge, University Press; (1996) Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change: Contribution of Working Group III to the Second Assesswment Report, Summary for Policy Makers, , Cambridge University Press; Lind, R.C., Arrow, K.J., (1982) Discounting for Time and Risk in Energy Policy, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD; Lind, R.C., Reassessing the Government's Discount Rate Policy in Light of New Theory and Data in a World Economy with a High Degree of Capital Mobility (1990) Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 18 (2), pp. S20-21; Lind, R.C., Intergenerational Equity, Discounting, and the Role of Cost-Benefit Analysis in Evaluating Global Climate Policy (1995) Energy Policy, 23 (4-5), pp. 379-389; Maaas, A., (1962) Design of Water-Resource Systems, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Major, D.C., Multiobjective Water Resource Planning (1977) Water Resources Monograph 4, , American Geophysical Union, Washington, D.C; Major, D.C., Frederick, K.D., Water Resources Planning and Climate Change: Assessments, Methods (1997) Climatic Change, 37. , this volume; Mannc, A.S., The Rate of Time Preference: Implications for the Greenhouse Debate (1995) Energy Policy, 23 (4-5), pp. 391-394; Marglin, S.A., The Social Rate of Discount and the Optimal Rate of Investment (1963) Quarterly Journal of Economics., 77 (1), pp. 95-111; Marglin, S.A., The Opportunity Costs of Public Investment (1963) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 77 (2), pp. 274-289; Marglin, S.A., (1967) Public Investment Criteria, , MIT Press, Cambridge.
