We document that recent climatic warming and resultant wetland desiccation are causing severe declines in 4 once-common amphibian species native to Yellowstone. Climate monitoring over 6 decades, remote sensing, and repeated surveys of 49 ponds indicate that decreasing annual precipitation and increasing temperatures during the warmest months of the year have significantly altered the landscape and the local biological communities. Drought is now more common and more severe than at any time in the past century. Compared with 16 years ago, the number of permanently dry ponds in northern Yellowstone has increased 4-fold. Of the ponds that remain, the proportion supporting amphibians has declined significantly, as has the number of species found in each location. Our results indicate that climatic warming already has disrupted one of the best-protected ecosystems on our planet and that current assessments of species' vulnerability do not adequately consider such impacts. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Amphibian community; Drought; Global warming; Landscape change; Remote sensing","Amphibia; article; climate change; desiccation; drought; ecosystem; landscape; national park; nonhuman; pond; priority journal; remote sensing; warming; wetland; Amphibians; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Population Density; Population Dynamics; United States; Wetlands; Amphibia",,,,,,"Pounds, J.A., Widespread amphibian extinctions from endemic disease driven by global warming (2006) Nature, 439, pp. 161-167; Stuart, S.N., Status and trends of amphibian declines and extinctions worldwide (2004) Science, 3, pp. 1783-1786; Collins, J.P., Storfer, A., Global amphibian declines: Sorting the hypotheses (2003) Divers Distrib, 9, pp. 89-98; Skerratt, L.F., Spread of Chytridiomycosis has caused the rapid global decline and extinction of frogs (2007) EcoHealth, 4, pp. 125-134; Reading, C.J., Linking global warming to amphibian declines through its effects on female body condition and survivorship (2007) Oecologia, 151, pp. 125-131; Noss, R.F., Carroll, C., Vance-Borland, K., Wuerthner, G., A multicriteria assessment of the irreplaceability and vulnerability of sites in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (2002) Conserv Biol, 16, p. 895; Alford, R.A., Richards, S.J., Global amphibian declines: A problem in applied ecology (1999) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 30, pp. 133-165; Blaustein, A.R., Romansic, J.M., Kiesecker, J.M., Hatch, A.C., Ultraviolet radiation, toxic chemicals and amphibian population declines (2003) Divers Distrib, 9, pp. 123-140; Beebee, T.J.C., Amphibian breeding and climate (1995) Nature, 374, pp. 219-220; Wake, D.B., Climate change implicated in amphibian and lizard declines (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 8201-8202; Alford, R.A., Bradfield, K.S., Richards, S.J., Global warming and amphibian losses (2007) Nature, 447, pp. E3-E4; Carey, C., Alexander, M.A., Climate change and amphibian declines: Is there a link?
