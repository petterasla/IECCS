This paper investigates the effects of climate variability on the termination of the ice season in the Baltic region. In particular, trends and fluctuations observed in the cryophenological records from this region are analyzed in detail, searching for possible connections with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO seems to affect mostly the late-winter temperature (January-March) with a significant impact also on the mid-spring (April-May) period, when the air temperature is strongly correlated to the ice dates. A regional analysis shows the existence in the series of winter temperature (JFM) of the same fluctuations as the winter NAO. The same components can be found in the cryophenological records and (partly) in the series of spring temperature. Nevertheless, both ice phenology and spring temperature show the existence of a very well defined trend that is not detectable in the series of winter NAO at time scales of a century or longer. This leads to the conclusion that winter NAO has still a weak, though significant, effect on the regime of spring temperature in the Baltic region and explains the most significant fluctuating components embedded in the cryophenological records. However it is argued that other climatic forcings, related to CO2-induced regional and global warming, acting at the end of the ice season, are able to induce pronounced trends in the regime of spring temperature and have an important impact on the cryosphere leading to the earlier occurrence of ice break-up observed in the last several decades. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
