Recently, digital cameras have been deployed as part of the existing network of ecosystem CO2 flux towers to provide a time-series of canopy images, and various numerical indices have so far been used by different authors. Aims: To identify which are the most effective colour indices to calculate from the signals extracted from digital cameras, in order to provide recommendations to the scientific community. Methods: Sample images of a Japanese beech (Fagus crenata) forest onMt. Tsukuba (Japan) were used to define and calculate 12 colour signals and vegetation indices. Results: Although the strength of green signal and green excess index were reliable indicators for stimating foliage growth period, the indices were susceptible to low-visibility weather conditions and distance from the camera. Hue provided a robust metric, showing much less scatter during the vegetative period and a good indication of spring bud break. The bud break dates derived from the indices were slightly earlier than those assessed by visual observation, while the bscission dates were later. Conclusions:We propose that of all the candidate colour indices, hue is the most promising for the detection of bud break as it was least affected by atmospheric conditions. © 2011 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.","Canopy phenology; Deciduous broadleaved forest; Digital image; HSL; RGB","Fagus; Fagus crenata",,,,,,"Ahrends, H.A., Brugger, R., Stockli, R., Schenk, J., Michna, P., Jeanneret, F., Wanner, H., Eugster, W., Quantitative phenological observations of a mixed beech forest in northern Switzerland with digital photography (2008) Journal of Geophysical Research, 113, pp. G04004; Ahrends, H.E., Etzold, S., Kutsch, W.L., Stoeckli, R., Bruegger, R., Jeanneret, F., Wanner, H., Eugster, W., Tree phenology and carbon dioxide fluxes: Use of digital photography for process-based interpretation at the ecosystem scale (2009) Climate Research, 39, pp. 261-274; Archetti, M., Döring, T.F., Hagen, S.B., Hughes, N.M., Leather, S.R., Lee, D.W., Lev-Yadun, S., Schaberg, P.G., Unravelling the evolution of autumn colours: An interdisciplinary approach (2009) Trends In Ecology and Evolution, 24, pp. 166-173; Baldocchi, D.D., Black, T.A., Curtis, P.S., Falge, E., Fuentes, J.D., Granier, A., Gu, L., Schmid, H.P., Predicting the onset of net carbon uptake by deciduous forests with soil temperature and climate data: A synthesis of FLUXNET data (2005) International Journal of Biometeorology, 49, pp. 377-387; Chmielewski, F.M., Rötzer, T., Response of tree phenology to climate change across Europe (2001) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 108, pp. 101-112; Falkowski, M.J., Gessler, P.E., Morgan, P., Hudak, A.T., Smith, A.M.S., Characterizing and mapping forest fire fuels using ASTER imagery and gradient modeling (2005) Forest Ecology and Management, 217, pp. 129-146; Graham, E.A., Yuen, E.M., Robertson, G.F., Kaiser, W.J., Hamilton, M.P., Rundel, P.W., Bud burst and leaf area expansion measured with a novel mobile camera system and simple color thresholding (2009) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 65, pp. 238-244; Graham, E.A., Riordan, E.C., Yuen, E.M., Estrin, D., Rundel, P.W., Public internet-connected cameras used as a crosscontinental ground-based plant phenology monitoring system (2010) Global Change Biology, , doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02164.x; Hayashi, Y., Meteorological Observation Station at the summit of Mt.
