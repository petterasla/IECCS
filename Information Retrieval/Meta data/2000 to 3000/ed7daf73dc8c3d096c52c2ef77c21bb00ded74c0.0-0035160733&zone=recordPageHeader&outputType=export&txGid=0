These measurements clearly show the presence of the 11.3-μm thermal emission band of nitric acid situated between 850-920cm-1. By using the FASCOD3 line-by-line radiation code to simulate the background thermal emission, the measured seasonally averaged surface radiative forcing due to nitric acid is determined to be 0.055Wm-2±15%. The zenith column amounts of nitric acid are found to vary between 7.9x1015 and 1.1x1016moleculescm-2±15%. An estimation is made of the contribution of nitric acid to the direct radiative forcing of the Earth's surface since pre-industrial times for northern mid-latitudes. This work suggests that nitric acid may play a role that is comparable to that of other greenhouse gases, such as CFC-11, in the forcing of the Earth's climate system. Under polluted conditions, nitric acid may contribute about half of the radiative forcing that is currently associated with tropospheric ozone.
