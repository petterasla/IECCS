The present microcosm-study investigates the effect of different forms of inorganic N fertilizers on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from two different agricultural soils. The relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and soil microbial communities, N transformation rates and plant (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Morex) growth were investigated. Repeated N fertilization led to increased N2O emissions. In a parallel survey of functional microbial population dynamics we observed a stimulation of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidisers accompanied with these N2O emissions. The ratio of archaeal to bacterial ammonium monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene copies (data obtained from Inselsbacher et al., 2010) correlated positively with N2O fluxes, which suggests a direct or indirect involvement of archaea in N2O fluxes. Repeated N fertilization also stimulated methane oxidation, which may also be related to a stimulation of ammonia oxidizers. The fertilizer effects differed between soil types: In the more organic Niederschleinz soil N-turnover rates increased more strongly after fertilization, while in the sandy Purkersdorf soil plant growth and soil respiration were accelerated depending on fertilizer N type. Compared to addition of NH4 + and NO3 -, addition of NH4NO3 fertilizer resulted in the largest increase in global warming potential as a summary indicator of all GHG related effects. This effect resulted from the strongest increase of both N2O and CO2 emission while plant growth was not equally stimulated, compared to e.g. KNO3 fertilization. In order to decrease N losses from agricultural ecosystems and in order to minimize soil derived global warming potential, this study points to the need for interdisciplinary investigations of the highly complex interactions within plant-soil-microbe-atmosphere systems. By understanding the microbial processes underlying fertilizer effects on GHG emissions the N use efficiency of crops could be refined. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agricultural soil; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Microbial community structure; N fertilizer; Nitrous oxide","agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; fertilizer application; gas flow; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; microbial community; microcosm; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; prokaryote; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; transformation; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",,,,,,"Abdalla, M., Jones, M., Ambus, P., Williams, M., Emissions of nitrous oxide from Irish arable soils: Effects of tillage and reduced N input (2009) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, , doi:10.1007/s10705-009-9273-8; Ambus, P., Relationship between gross nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide emission in grass-clover pasture (2005) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 72, pp. 189-199; Ambus, P., Zechmeister-Boltenstern, S., Butterbach-Bahl, K., Sources of nitrous oxide emitted from European forest soils (2006) Biogeosciences, 3, pp. 135-145; Baggs, E.M., Blum, H., CH4 oxidation and emissions of CH4 and N2O from Lolium perenne swards under elevated atmospheric CO2 (2004) Soil Biol Biochem, 36, pp. 713-723; Bedard, C., Knowles, R., Physiology, biochemistry, and specific inhibitors of CH4, NH4 +, and CO oxidation by methanotrophs and nitrifiers (1989) Microbiol Rev, 53, pp. 68-84; Bodelier, P.L.E., Roslev, P., Hencke, T., Frenzel, P., Stimulation by ammonium-based fertilizers of methane oxidation in soil around rice roots (2000) Nature, 403, pp. 421-424; Bouwman, A.F., Exchange of greenhouse gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere (1990) Soils and the Greenhouse Effect, pp. 61-127. , A.
