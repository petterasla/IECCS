Lack of information led to this study on the influence of different amounts and sources of nitrogen on N2O emission from a maize (Zea mays L.)-groundnut (Arachis hypogae L.) crop rotation in an Ultisol of the humid tropics. The treatments were: inorganic N + crop residues (NC), inorganic N only (RN), and half of inorganic N + crop residues + chicken manure (NCM). The corresponding amount of N applied was 322, 180, and 400 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively. The N2O emissions depended on the amounts and types of N. A maximum peak (9889 ± 2106 μg N2O-N m-2 d-1) was detected at 2 wk before maize sowing amended with chicken manure, showing a persistent influence on N transformations and N2O release. The mineral N from either applied source became low by 2 to 4 wk, coinciding with the small N2O fluxes or its consumption to a few isolated instances. The N2O flux significantly correlated with the mineral N and water-filled pore spaces. The direct annual N2O emission was 3.94 ± 0.23, 1.90 ± 0.08, and 1.41 ± 0.07 kg N2O-N ha-1 from the NCM, NC, and RN treatments, respectively. The corresponding N2O-N loss of the applied N plus N fixed by groundnut was 0.83, 0.49, and 0.59%. Overestimations of direct annual N2O emission using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology suggest a location-specific emission factor for variable N sources to be considered.",,"Climate change; Crops; Industrial emissions; Manures; Soils; Crop rotation; Nitrogen oxides; nitric oxide; nitrogen; fertilizer; nitrous oxide; agriculture; air pollutant; air pollution; article; climate change; crop; gas; global climate; maize; manure; sampling; soil; soil pollution; sowing; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; humidity; peanut; tropic climate; Agriculture; Air Pollutants, Environmental; Arachis hypogaea; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Humidity; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tropical Climate; Zea mays; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Arachis hypogaea; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Humidity; Soil; Tropical Climate; Zea mays",,"nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2; Air Pollutants; Fertilizers; Soil",,,,"Abbasi, M.K., Adams, W.A., Estimation of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in grassland soil associated with urea-N using 15N and nitrification inhibitor (2000) Biol.
