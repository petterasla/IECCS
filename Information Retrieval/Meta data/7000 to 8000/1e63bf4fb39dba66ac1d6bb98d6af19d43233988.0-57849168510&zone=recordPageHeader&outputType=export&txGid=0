While this is a complex and difficult task, a necessary step is to elicit a broad range of public opinions in forest planning to ensure that decisions serve the needs of various forest stakeholders and society at large. This study seeks to understand how six forest dependent communities in British Columbia prioritize a number of attributes associated with sustainable forest management by using a simple survey-based measurement tool, the Thurstone scale. The results suggest that ecological attributes are a higher priority for survey respondents followed by quality of life, global wanning, and economic considerations. This paper explores some of the ramifications of the priorities for sustainable forest management measured in these six communities as well as implications for using the Thurstone scale in processes like Public Advisory Groups. © 2008 NRC.",,"Surveys; British Columbia; Economic considerations; Forest planning; In processes; Measurement tools; Public opinions; Quality of lives; Sustainable Forest managements; Forestry; community forestry; decision making; forest management; stakeholder; sustainable forestry; Forest Management; Forestry; Surveys; British Columbia; Canada; North America",,,,,,"Agahian, F., Amirshahi, S., Appearance variations of textile materials due to different near grey backgrounds (2006) Color Res.
