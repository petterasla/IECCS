Nine industrialized countries have explored the technical boundaries of CO2 emission restrictions during the next 40 to 50 years using comparable scenario assumptions and a standard model, MARKAL. Quantitative results for the countries are shown side by side in a set of energy maps that compare the least-cost evolution of the national energy systems by the main factors that contribute to CO2 emissions. The ability to restrict future CO2 emissions and the most cost-effective measures for doing so differ among the countries; an international agreement that would mandate substantial emission restrictions among countries by an equal percentage reduction is clearly impossible. The results are a first step toward a basis for allocating such international reductions, and the multinational process by which they were produced provides an example for further international greenhouse gas abatement costing studies.","CO2 emissions; Energy models; Global warming","carbon emission; energy system; global warming; greenhouse gas; MARKAL model; modelling approach; national strategy; pollution control",,,,,,"Beaver, R., Structural comparison of the models of EMF 12 (1993) Energy Policy, 21 (3), pp. 238-248; Cline, W.R., (1991) Political Economy of the Greenhouse Effect, , Washington Institute for International Economics (mimeographed August); Cline, W.R., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC; Cline, W.R., (1994) Costs and Benefits of Greenhouse Abatement: A Guide to Policy Analysis, , OECD/IEA (1994); Coherence, (1991) Cost-effectiveness Analysis of CO2 Reduction Options Report for the Commission of the European Communities, , DG XII, Brussels; Dean, A., (1994) Costs of Cutting CO2 Emissions: Evidence from 'Top-Down' Models, , OECD/IEA (1994); Fishbone, L.G., Giesen, G., Goldstein, G., Hymmen, H.A., Stocks, K.J., Vos, H., Wilde, D., Abilock, H., (1983) User's Guide for MARKAL (BNL/KFA Version 2.0): A Multi-Period, Linear-Programming Model for Energy Systems Analysis, , IEA International Systems Analysis Project, BNL 51701, Brookhaven National Laboratory and Kernforschungsanlage Jülich; Goldstein, G.A., (1991) PC-MARKAL and the MARKAL Users Support System (MUSS): User's Guide, , BNL-46319, Brookhaven National Laboratory; Goldstein, G.A., (1995) MARKAL-MACRO: A Methodology for Informed Energy, Economy, and Environmental Decision-Making, , BNL-61832, Brookhaven National Laboratory; Grubb, M., Policy modelling for climate change: The missing models (1993) Energy Policy, 21 (3), p. 203; Grubb, M., Rayner, S., Tanabe, A., Russell, J., Ledic, M., Mathur, A., Brackley, P., Energy policies and the greenhouse effect: A study of nationl differences (1991) Energy Policy, 19 (10), p. 917; Hamilton, L.D., Goldstein, G.A., Lee, J., Manne, A.S., Marcuse, W., Morris, S.C., Wene, C.-O., (1992) MARKAL-MACRO: An Overview, , BNL-48377 Brookhaven National Laboratory; Hill, D., More accurate energy conservation supply curves (1991) IEA ETSP NEWS No 4, , Netherlands Energy Research Foundation, Petten; Johansson, T.B., Swisher, J.N., (1994) Perspectives on Bottom-up Analysis of Costs of Carbon Dioxide Emissions Reductions, , OECD/IEA (1994); Kram, T., (1993) National Energy Options for Reducing CO2 Emissions Vol 1 the International Connection: A Report of the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme/Annex IV (1990-1993), 1. , ECN-C-93-046, Netherlands Energy Research Foundation ECN; Manne, A.S., (1981) ETA-MACRO: A User's Guide, , EA-1724, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA; Manne, A.S., Mendelsohn, R., Richels, R.G., MERGE: A model for evaluating regional and global effects of GHG reduction policies (1995) Energy Policy, 23 (1), pp. 17-34; Manne, A.S., Richels, R.G., (1992) Buying Greenhouse Insurance: The Economic Costs of CO2 Emissions, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Manne, A.S., Richels, R.G., The costs of stabilizing global CO2 emissions: A probabilistic model based on expert judgments (1994) Energy Journal, 15 (1), pp. 31-56; Manne, A.S., Rutherford, T.F., International trade in oil, gas and carbon emission rights: An intertemporal general equilibrium model (1994) Energy Journal, 15 (1), pp. 57-76; Manne, A.S., Wene, C.-O., (1992) MARKAL-MACRO: A Linked Model for Energy-Economy Analysis, , BNL-47161, Brookhaven National Laboratory; Nordhaus, W.D., (1994) Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change, , MIT Press, Cambridge; (1994) The Economics of Climate Change: Proceedings of an OECD/IEA Conference, , Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris; Rowe, M.D., Hill, D., (1989) Estimating National Costs of Controlling Emissions from the Energy System: A Report of the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Project.
