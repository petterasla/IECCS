The CSL variability is dominated by the variability of precipitation over the Volga River basin. The precipitation during summer plays a dominant role and can explain the two major events that happened in the 1930s (drop) and after 1977 (rise). Impacts are expected from global warming due to enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations; especially the precipitation over the Volga River basin is expected to increase. It is, however, compensated more or less by increased evaporation over the Caspian Sea (CS) itself. It is shown that the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (Hamburg) models are able to simulate most processes relevant for the CSL variability quite realistically, i.e., within the uncertainty of observational data. The simulations suggest a slight increase of the CSL in the 21st century; but due to a large variability of precipitation over the Volga River basin a statement concerning the future development of the CSL cannot be made with confidence at the moment. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Caspian Sea Level; Global warming; Model simulations; Sea level variability","atmospheric circulation; coastal zone; evaporation; global warming; greenhouse gas; modeling; precipitation (climatology); sea level change; Caspian Sea; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Volga Basin",,,,,,"Allen, A., Jackson, J., Walker, R., Late Cenozoic reorganisation of the Arabia-Eurasia collision and the comparison of the short-term and long-term deformation rates (2004) Tectonics, 23, pp. TC2008. , 10.1029/2003TC001530; Arpe, K., Bengtsson, L., Golitsyn, G.S., Mokhov, I.I., Semenov, V.A., Sporyshev, P.V., Connection between Caspian Sea level variability and ENSO (2000) Geophysical Research Letters, 27, pp. 2693-2696; Cazenave, A., Bonnefond, K., Dominh, K., Schaeffer, P., Caspian sea level from Topex-Poseidon altimetry: level now falling (1997) Geophysical Research Letters, 24, pp. 881-884; Elguindi, N., Giorgi, F., Projected changes in the Caspian Sea level for the 21st century based on the latest AOGCM simulations (2006) Geophysical Research Letters, 33; Gedney, N., Cox, P.M., Betts, R.A., Boucher, O., Huntingford, C., Stott, P.A., Detection of a direct carbon dioxide effect in continental river run off records (2006) Nature, 439, pp. 835-838; Golitsyn, G.S., The Caspian sea level as a problem of diagnosis and prognosis of the regional climate change.
