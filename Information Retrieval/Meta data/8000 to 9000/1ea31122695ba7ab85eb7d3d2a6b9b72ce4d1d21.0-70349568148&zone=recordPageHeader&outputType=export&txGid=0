Four treatments including Treatment CK 1, DCD-1 (application of DCD with basal fertilizer), DCD-2 (DCD with tillering fertilizer) and DCD-3 (DCD with panicle initiation fertilizer), were designed and implemented in pot experiment. Total N 2O and CH 4 emissions from DCD-treated soils were decreased profoundly when compared with that from urea alone (P &lt; 0.05). Application of DCD together with basal fertilizer, tillering fertilizer and panicle initiation fertilizer reduced N 2O emission by 8, 30 and 2%, respectively, while those for CH 4 were 21, 8 and 1%. The field experiment with four treatments was carried out subsequently, and a kind of urease inhibitor hydroquinone (HQ) was also incorporated with DCD simultaneously. The combined use of HQ and DCD with basal fertilizer, tillering fertilizer and panicle initiation fertilizer decreased N 2O emissions by 24, 56 and 17%, respectively, while those for CH 4 were 35, 19 and 12%. N 2O emission was effectively reduced by the inhibitor(s) applied with tillering fertilizer before midseason aeration, while CH 4 emission was effectively decreased by the combined use of inhibitor(s) with basal fertilizer before rice transplanting. Furthermore, an increase in rice yield and a reduction of total global warming potential (GWP) of CH 4 and N 2O could be achieved by using inhibitor(s) in rice paddy field. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","CH4 emission; Greenhouse gases; GWP; Mitigation strategy; N2O emission; Nitrification inhibitor; Rice paddy field; Timing of application; Urease inhibitor","agricultural emission; crop yield; fertilizer application; fieldwork; global warming; inhibitor; methane; mitigation; nitrification; nitrous oxide; paddy field; rice; transplantation; urea",,,,,,"Arah, J.R.M., Smith, K.A., Steady state denitrification in aggregated soils: A mathematical model (1989) J Soil Sci, 40, pp. 139-149. , doi:10.1111/j.1365-2389.1989.tb01262.x; Aulakh, M.S., Singh, B., Nitrogen losses and fertilizer N use efficiency in irrigated porous soils (1997) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 7, pp. 1-16; Aulakh, M.S., Doran, J.W., Mosier, A.R., Soil denitrification-significance, measurement, and effects of management (1992) Adv Soil Sci, 18, pp. 2-42; Boeckx, P., Xu, X.K., van Cleemput, O., Mitigating of N2O and CH4 emission from rice and wheat cropping systems using dicyandiamide and hydroquinone (2005) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 72, pp. 41-49. , doi:10.1007/s10705-004-7352-4; Bronson, K.F., Mosier, A.R., Suppression of methane oxidation in aerobic soil by nitrogen fertilizers, nitrification inhibitors and urease inhibitors (1994) Biol Fertil Soils, 17, pp. 263-268. , doi:10.1007/BF00383979; Cai, Z.C., Xu, H., Zhang, H.H., Estimate of methane emission from rice paddy field in Taihu Region, China (1994) Pedosphere, 4 (4), pp. 297-306; Crill, P.M., Martikainen, P.J., Nyakanen, H., Silvola, J., Temperature and N fertilization effects on methane oxidation in a drained peat land soil (1994) Soil Biol Biochem, 26, pp. 1331-1339. , doi:10.1016/0038-0717(94)90214-3; Denier van der Gon, H.A.C., Neue, H.U., Oxidation of methane in the rhizosphere of rice plants (1996) Biol Fertil Soils, 22, pp. 359-366. , doi:10.1007/BF00334584; Ghosh, S., Majumdar, D., Jain, M.C., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from an irrigated rice of North India (2003) Chemosphere, 51, pp. 181-195. , doi:10.1016/S0045-6535(02)00822-6; Granli, T., Bockman, O.C., Nitrous oxide from agriculture (1994) Nor J Agric Sci, (SUPPL. 12), pp. 1-128; http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf, IPCC (2007a) Climate change 2007: changes in atmospheric constituents and in radioactive forcing., Accessed 17 Jan 2008http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter7.pdf, IPCC (2007b) Climate change 2007: couplings between changes in the climate system and biogeochemistry., Accessed 25 Feb 2008http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter8.pdf, IPCC (2007c) Climate change 2007: agriculture.
