Many of the distributed generations are set up in the vicinity of customers, with the advantage that this decreases transmission losses and transmission capacity. However, output power generated from renewable energy such as wind power and photovoltaics, is influenced by weather conditions. Therefore if the distributed generation increases with conventional control schemes, the voltage variation in a distribution system becomes a serious problem. In this paper, an optimal control method of distribution voltage with coordination of distributed installations, such as On Load Tap Changer (OLTC), Step Voltage Regulator (SVR), Shunt Capacitor (SC), Shunt Reactor (ShR), and Static Var Compensator (SVC), is proposed. In this research, the communication infrastructure is assumed to be widespread in the distribution network. The proposed technique combines genetic algorithm (GA) and Tabu search (TS) to determine the control operation. In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulation results are presented for a distribution network model with distributed (photovoltaic) generation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
