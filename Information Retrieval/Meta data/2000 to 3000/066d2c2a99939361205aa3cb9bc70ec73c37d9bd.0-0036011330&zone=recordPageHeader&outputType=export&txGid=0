NC 8288) were grown at 28/22°C or 32/26°C day/night temperature regimes and then transferred to the opposite regime for 0-15 d before or 0-24 h after anthesis. For plants initially grown at 28/22°C, moderate temperature stress before anthesis decreased the percentage of fruit set per plant, but did not clarify the thermosensitive period. The same level of stress did not significantly reduce fruit set when applied immediately after anthesis. For plants initially grown at 32/26°C, fruit set was completely prevented unless a relief period of more than 5 d was provided before anthesis. The same level of stress relief for 3-24 h after anthesis also increased fruit set. Plants were most sensitive to 32/26°C temperatures 7-15 d before anthesis. Microscopic investigation of anthers in plants grown continuously at high temperature indicated disruption of development in the pollen, endothecium, epidermis, and stomium. This disruption was reduced, but still observable in plants relieved from high temperature for 10 d before anthesis.","Anther; Fruit set; Global warming; Heat tolerance; Male reproductive structures; Microsporogenesis; Pollen; Temperature-sensitive period; Thermotolerance","Fruits; High temperature effects; Physiology; Tomatoes; Plants (botany); Endothecium; Lycopersicon; Lycopersicon esculentum; adaptation; article; cytology; ecosystem; fruit; growth, development and aging; physiology; plant; plant stem; pollen; reproduction; temperature; time; tomato; Adaptation, Physiological; Ecosystem; Fruit; Lycopersicon esculentum; Plant Components; Plant Stems; Pollen; Reproduction; Temperature; Time Factors",,,,,,"Ahmed, F.E., Hall, A.E., DeMason, D.A., Heat injury during floral development in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata, Fabaceae) (1992) American Journal of Botany, 79, pp. 784-791; Baker, J.T., Allen L.H., Jr., Contrasting crop species responses to CO2 and temperature: Rice, soybean and citrus (1993) Vegetatio, 104-105, pp. 239-260; Baker, J.T., Allen L.H., Jr., Boote, K.J., Temperature effects on rice at elevated CO2 concentration (1992) Journal of Experimental Botany, 43, pp. 959-964; Baker, J.T., Allen L.H., Jr., Boote, K.J., Jones, P., Jones, J.W., Response of soybean to air temperature and carbon dioxide concentration (1989) Crop Science, 29, pp. 98-105; Bangerth, F., Ho, L.C., Fruit position and fruit set sequence in a truss as factors determining final size of tomato fruits (1984) Annals of Botany, 53, pp. 315-319; Bertin, N., Competition for assimilates and fruit position affect fruit set in indeterminate greenhouse tomato (1995) Annals of Botany, 75, pp. 55-65; Borthwick, H.A., Hendricks, S.B., Parker, M.W., The reaction controlling floral initiation (1952) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 38, pp. 929-934; Clement, C., Audran, J.C., Anther wall layers control pollen sugar nutrition in Lilium (1995) Protoplasma, 187, pp. 172-181; Foster, A.C., Tatman, E.C., Environmental conditions influencing the development of tomato pockets or puffs (1937) Plant Physiology, 12, pp. 875-880; Gardner, R.G., Mountain Gold tomato (1993) HortScience, 28, pp. 348-349; Geisenberg, C., Stewart, K., Field crop management (1986) The tomato crop.
