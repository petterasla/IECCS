Potential changes in rivers are outlined in this review in the context of changes in the intensity of rainfall, the activity of tropical cyclones, runoff response (including that of Europe, dry lands and high latitude environments), and geomorphological reactions, including rates of soil erosion. In general, however, much work remains to be done to establish the full range of geomorphological responses that may take place in fluvial systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
