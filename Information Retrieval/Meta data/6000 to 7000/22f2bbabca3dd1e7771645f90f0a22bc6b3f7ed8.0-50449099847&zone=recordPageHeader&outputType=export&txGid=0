The environmental impact results are then compared with the ones obtained for fossil fuels. In this regard, some exergetic expressions are derived depending primarily upon the exergetic utilization ratios of fossil fuels and hydrogen: the fossil fuel based global waste exergy factor, hydrogen based global exergetic efficiency, fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient and hydrogen based global exergetic indicator. These relations incorporate predicted exergetic utilization ratios for hydrogen energy from non-fossil fuel resources such as water, etc., and are used to investigate whether or not exergetic utilization of hydrogen can significantly reduce the fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient (ranging from 1 to +∞) indicating the fossil fuel consumption and contribute to increase the hydrogen based global exergetic indicator (ranging from 0 to 1) indicating the hydrogen utilization at a certain ratio of fossil fuel utilization. In order to verify all these exergetic expressions, the actual fossil fuel consumption and production data are taken from the literature. Due to the unavailability of appropriate hydrogen data for analysis, it is assumed that the utilization ratios of hydrogen are ranged between 0 and 1. For the verification of these parameters, the variations of fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient and hydrogen based global exergetic indicator as the functions of fossil fuel based global waste exergy factor, hydrogen based global exergetic efficiency and exergetic utilization of hydrogen from non-fossil fuels are analyzed and discussed in detail. Consequently, if exergetic utilization ratio of hydrogen from non-fossil fuel sources at a certain exergetic utilization ratio of fossil fuels increases, the fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient will decrease and the hydrogen based global exergetic indicator will increase. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Efficiency; Energy; Exergetic indicator; Exergy; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen; Irreversibility coefficient; Waste exergy","Energy conservation; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Exergy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Heat engines; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Ketones; Nonmetals; Range finding; Steel metallurgy; Water resources; Efficiency; Energy; Exergetic efficiency; Exergetic indicator; Fossil fuel consumption; Fossil fuel resources; Fossil fuel sources; Fossil fuel utilization; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen utilization; Irreversibility coefficient; Non-fossil fuels; Parametric performance; Production data; Sustainable solutions; Utilization ratios; Variations of; Waste exergy; Fuels",,,,,,"Rosen, M.A., Dincer, I., Exergy as the confluence of energy, environment and sustainable development (2001) Exergy, An International Journal, 1 (1), pp. 3-13; Dincer, I., Rosen, M.A., Thermodynamic aspects of renewables and sustainable development (2005) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 9 (2), pp. 169-189; Rosen, M.A., Dincer, I., Kanoglu, M., Role of exergy in increasing efficiency and sustainability and reducing environmental impact (2008) Energy Policy, 36, pp. 128-137; Strong, M.F., Energy, environment and development (1992) Energy Policy, 20, pp. 490-494; Do Sacramento EM, De Lima LC, Oliveria CJ, Veziroglu TN.
