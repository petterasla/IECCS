The motivation of this research is to develop robust analytical cross-calibration techniques for inter-calibration of various satellite radiometer instruments, with the first projected application being the multi-satellite Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation to be launched in 2013. The significance of this work is that it will allow the formation of consistent multi-decadal time series of geophysical measurements for multiple satellite microwave radiometers that are free of instrumental biases and other long-term changes in radiometric calibration, which will allow researchers to study global climate change. Descriptions are given for two independent calibration techniques: a Taylor series expansion of the oceanic brightness temperature (T b) spectrum between dissimilar radiometer channels and a non-linear regression among multi-channel T b measurements. In the first approach, predictions were made of T b's at a destination frequency from T b's of a close by source frequency by expansion of the oceanic brightness temperature spectrum in a Taylor series centered at the source frequency. The relationships between T b's and frequencies were derived from simulations using a radiative transfer model (RTM), which accounts for the total collected emissions from the ocean surface and the atmosphere. Further, earth incidence angle differences between radiometer channels were transformed in a similar manner using the partial derivatives of T b with incidence angle derived from RTM simulations. In the second approach, we used a prediction algorithm that relies on the correlation between radiometer T b's at various frequencies and polarizations and which uses a regression on the T b's and their non-linear transformations developed using an independent radiative transfer model. As a demonstration, near-simultaneous pair-wise ocean T b comparisons are presented between the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI), which is not sun synchronous, and the sun-synchronous polar orbiting WindSat, using oceanic T b observations from 2003-04. The corresponding results between these two inter- satellite calibration techniques are highly correlated, and results demonstrate that fixed channel-by-channel differences, of order 1 - 2 K exist between TMI and WindSat. These are significant radiometric calibration differences, which can be removed prior to forming joint data sets of geophysical parameter retrievals. © 2009, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"algorithm; brightness temperature; calibration; data set; global warming; long-term change; measurement method; microwave imagery; microwave radiometer; precipitation (climatology); regression analysis; satellite imagery; time series analysis",,,,,,"Gaiser, P.W., Germain, K.M.S., Twarog, E.M., Poe, G.A., Purdy, W., Richardson, D., Grossman, W., Chang, P.S., The WindSat spaceborne polarimetric microwave radiometer: Sensor description and early orbit performance (2004) Ieee Trans.
