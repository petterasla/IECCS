Here, we present a pollen-based quantitative temperature reconstruction from the mid latitudes of Australia that spans the last 135 000 years, enabling us to address this critical issue. Gradient analysis of a pollen dataset inclusive of over 1100 Quaternary and modern pollen spectra demonstrates the dominant influence of temperature over Quaternary pollen composition and vegetation change in western Tasmania, Australia. We develop and apply a transfer function for average annual temperature that performs excellently under cross-validation (r 2 = 0.76; RMSEP 1 °C), is not influenced by spatial autocorrelation and that reveals a remarkably close correlation between oceanic and atmospheric temperature change over the last 135 000 years. Significantly, we report a substantially lower degree of cooling during the LGM/MIS 2 (3.7-4.2 °C below present) than previously estimated; a similar degree of cooling during MIS 4 as the LGM (ca 4 °C); and a 1 °C warming during the Last Interglacial relative to today. We conclude that atmospheric and oceanic temperature changes in this region have remained coupled throughout the substantial climatic shifts associated with glacial-interglacial cycles over the last 135 000 years. Western Tasmanian pollen records have great potential as a Southern Hemisphere terrestrial palaeothermometer and are critically located to provide significant input in to debates over the occurrence and influence of regional and global climatic episodes in the Southern Hemisphere. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Australia; Climatic episodes; Climatic shifts; Critical issues; Cross validation; Data sets; Earth's climate; Glacial-interglacial cycles; Global climate changes; Gradient analysis; Last interglacial; Late quaternary; Midlatitudes; Oceanic temperature; Orbital forcing; Pollen composition; Similar degree; Southern Hemisphere; Spatial autocorrelations; Tasmania , Australia; Temperature reconstruction; Tight coupling; Vegetation change; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Earth (planet); Plants (botany); Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; atmosphere-ocean coupling; autocorrelation; climate variation; data set; glacial-interglacial cycle; global climate; interglacial; orbital forcing; paleotemperature; palynology; quantitative analysis; Quaternary; reconstruction; Southern Hemisphere; temperature profile; transfer function; vegetation dynamics; water temperature; Australia; Tasmania",,,,,,"Anderson, R.F., Ali, S., Bratmiller, L.I., Nielsen, S.H.H., Fleisher, M.Q., Anderson, B.E., Burkle, L.H., Wind-driven upwelling in the southern ocean and the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO 2 (2009) Science, 323, pp. 1443-1448; Anderson, B., Mackintosh, A., Temperature change is the major driver of late-glacial and Holocene glacier fluctuations in New Zealand (2006) Geology, 34, p. 121; Anker, S.A., Colhoun, E.A., Barton, C.E., Peterson, M.J., Barbetti, M., Holocene vegetation and paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic history from Lake Johnston, Tasmania (2001) Quaternary Research, 55, pp. 264-274; Ayliffe, L.K., Marinelli, P.C., Moriarty, K.C., Wells, R.T., McCulloch, M.T., Mortimer, G.E., Hellstrom, J.C., 500 ka precipitation record from southeastern Australia: evidence for interglacial aridity (1998) Geology, 26, pp. 147-150; Barrows, T., Juggins, S., De Deckker, P., Calvo, E., Pelegero, C., Long-term surface temperature and climate change in the Australian-New Zealand region (2007) Paleocenography, 22, pp. 1-17; Barrows, T.T., Lehman, S.J., Fifield, L.K., De Deckker, P., Absence of cooling in New Zealand and the adjacent ocean during the Younger Dryas chronozone (2007) Science, 318, p. 86; Barrows, T., Juggins, S., Sea-surface temperatures around the Australian margin and Indian Ocean during the last glacial maximum (2005) Quaternary Science Reviews, 24, pp. 1017-1047; Belyea, L.R., Revealing the Emperor's new clothes: niche-based palaeoenvironmental reconstructing in the light of recent ecological theory (2007) The Holocene, 15, pp. 683-688; Bennett, K.D., Haberle, S., Lumley, S.H., The last glacial-Holocene transition in Southern Chile (2000) Science, 290, pp. 325-328; Berger, A.L., Long-term variations of daily insolation and Quaternary climatic changes (1978) Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 35, pp. 2362-2367; Birks, H.J.B., Numerical tools in paleolimnology progress, potentialities, and problems (1998) Journal of Paleolimnology, 20, pp. 307-332; Bjune, A.E., Seppä, H., Birks, H.J.B., Quantitative summer-temperature reconstructions for the last 2000 years based on pollen-stratigraphical data from northern Fennoscandia (2009) Journal of Paleolimnology, 41, pp. 43-56; Bowden, A., Relict terrestrial dunes: legacies of a former climate in coastal north eastern Tasmania (1983) Zeitschrift Fur Geomorphologie, 45, pp. 153-174; Burge, P.I., Shulmeister, J., An MIS 5a to MIS 4 (or early MIS 3) environmental and climatic reconstruction from the northwest South Island, New Zealand, using beetle fossils (2007) Journal of Quaternary Science, 22, pp. 501-516; Cliff, A.D., Ord, J.K., (1973) Spatial Autocorrelation, , Pion, London; Colhoun, E.A., Glaciations of the west coast range, Tasmania (1985) Quaternary Research, 24, pp. 39-59; Colhoun, E.A., Pre-last glaciation maximum vegetation history at Henty Bridge, western Tasmania (1985) New Phytologist, 100, pp. 681-690; Colhoun, E.A., Lateglacial and Holocene vegetation history at Poets Hill Lake, western Tasmania (1992) Australian Geographer, 23, pp. 11-23; Colhoun, E.A., Application of Iversen's glacial-interglacial cycle to interpretation of the last glacial and Holocene vegetation of western Tasmania (1996) Quaternary Science Reviews, 15, pp. 557-580; Colhoun, E.A., Vegetation and climate during the last interglacial-glacial cycle in western Tasmania, Australia (2000) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 155, pp. 195-209; Colhoun, E.A., Quaternary glaciations of Tasmania and their ages (2004) Quaternary Glaciations: Extent and Chronology, Part III, pp. 353-360. , Elsevier, Rotterdam, J.
