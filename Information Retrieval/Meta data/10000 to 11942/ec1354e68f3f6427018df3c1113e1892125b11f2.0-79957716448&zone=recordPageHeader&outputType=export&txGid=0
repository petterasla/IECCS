Dozens of remediation technologies developed internationally could be divided in two general categories incineration and non-incineration. In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to study the environmental impacts of these two kinds of remediation technologies in selected PCB contaminated sites, where Infrared High Temperature Incineration (IHTI) and Base Catalyzed Decomposition (BCD) were selected as representatives of incineration and non-incineration. A combined midpoint/damage approach was adopted by using SimaPro 7.2 and IMPACTA2002+ to assess the human toxicity, ecotoxicity, climate change impact, and resource consumption from the five subsystems of IHTI and BCD technologies, respectively. It was found that the major environmental impacts through the whole lifecycle arose from energy consumption in both IHTI and BCD processes. For IHTI, primary and secondary combustion subsystem contributes more than 50% of midpoint impacts concerning with carcinogens, respiratory inorganics, respiratory organics, terrestrial ecotoxity, terrestrial acidification/eutrophication and global warming. In BCD process, the rotary kiln reactor subsystem presents the highest contribution to almost all the midpoint impacts including global warming, non-renewable energy, non-carcinogens, terrestrial ecotoxity and respiratory inorganics. In the view of midpoint impacts, the characterization values for global warming from IHTI and BCD were about 432.35 and 38.5kg CO2-eq per ton PCB-containing soils, respectively. LCA results showed that the single score of BCD environmental impact was 1468.97 Pt while IHTI's score is 2785.15 Pt, which indicates BCD potentially has a lower environmental impact than IHTI technology in the PCB contaminated soil remediation process. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental management; Life cycle assessment; PCB contaminated sites; Remediation technologies","Base catalyzed decomposition; BCD process; BCD technology; Climate change impact; Contaminated sites; Contaminated soils; Ecotoxicity; Energy consumption; High temperature; Human toxicity; Inorganics; Life cycle assessment; Life-cycle assessments; Non-renewable energy; Organics; Remediation technologies; Resource consumption; Secondary combustion; Carbon dioxide; Carcinogens; Catalysis; Contamination; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Global warming; Incineration; Life cycle; Organic pollutants; Platinum; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Rating; Remediation; Soil pollution; Technology; Toxicity; Land reclamation; carbon dioxide; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; bioreactor; climate change; comparative study; ecotoxicology; environmental impact; environmental management; incineration; life cycle analysis; PCB; soil remediation; article; base catalyzed decomposition; ecosystem restoration; infrared high temperature incineration; life cycle assessment; waste management; Alkalies; Catalysis; Environmental Remediation; Incineration; Polychlorinated Biphenyls",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Alkalies; Polychlorinated Biphenyls",,,,"Van Caneghem, J., Block, C., Van Brecht, A., Wauters, G., Vandecasteele, C., Mass balance for POPs in hazardous and municipal solid waste incinerators (2010) Chemosphere, 78, pp. 701-708; Buser, H.R., Dolezal, I.S., Wolfensberger, M., Rappe, C., Polychlorodibenzothiophenes, the sulfur analogs of the Polychlorodibenzofurans identified in incineration samples (1991) Environ.
