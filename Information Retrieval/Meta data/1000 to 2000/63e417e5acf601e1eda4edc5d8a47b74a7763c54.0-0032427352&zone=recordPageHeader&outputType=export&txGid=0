The geographical distribution of 195 peatlands previously identified by type were used to test the validity of the reconstructions. The test revealed that the reconstruction using data from Leemans and Cramer was more accurate than the reconstruction using the CCC GCM data. For this reason, the CCC 1XCO2 data was subtracted from the CCC 2XCO2 climatic data to produce an anomalies data set which was then added to the Leemans and Cramer data to project the distribution of the seven types of peatlands at 2XCO2. Results of this prediction were then compared to predictions using 2XCO2 data obtained from the Geophysics Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) GCM. The position of the southern limits of peatland distribution was compared to past distributions resulting from a warming period in the early to mid Holocene. Results of the predictions for the two climate change scenarios indicated a northward migration of the southern boundary of peatland ecosystems of approximately 780 km in the central portion of the Mackenzie River Basin. The model also predicted that Mid-Boreal peatlands would be located along a diagonal running from southeast to northwest from 60°longitude to an area just south of the Mackenzie Delta for both scenarios. High-Boreal and Subarctic peatlands were located to the north of the diagonal, while Low-Boreal peatlands were located to the south. However, the CCC anomalies + Leemans and Cramer predictions did not clearly define the Low-Boreal since Low-Boreal indicators were only located in the Cordilleran Ecological Province. Ecological diversity is anticipated to be maintained in the peatlands because all types were predicted to be found in the Basin at 2XCO2 but at different locations. Comparisons between the predicted position of the southern limits of peatland distribution and that during the early to mid Holocene indicate that the model's predictions were reasonable.",,"Bryophyta; bryophytes; Pteridophyta",,,,,,"Andrus, R.E., Wagner, D.J., Titus, J.E., Vertical zonation of Sphagnum mosses along hummock-hollow gradients (1983) Canadian Journal of Botany, 64, pp. 416-426; Bayley, S.E., Schindler, D.W., Parker, B.R., Staintion, M.P., Beaty, K.G., Effects of forest fire and drought on acidity of a base-poor boreal forest stream: Similarities between climatic warming and acidic precipitation (1992) Biogeochemistry, 17, pp. 191-204; Belland, R.J., Vitt, D.H., Bryophyte vegetation patterns along environmental gradients in continental bogs (1995) Ecoscience, 2, pp. 395-407; Bubier, J.L., Moore, T.R., Roulet, N.T., Methane emissions from wetlands in the midboreal region of northern Ontario, Canada (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 2240-2254","Gignac, L.D.; Faculte Saint-Jean, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alta.
