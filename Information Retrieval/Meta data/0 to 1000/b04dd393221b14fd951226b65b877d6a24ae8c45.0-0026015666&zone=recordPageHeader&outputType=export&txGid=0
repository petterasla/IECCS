Identification of changes in basin characteristics, especially in arid areas where the response to altered climate or land use is generally rapid and readily apparent, might provide the initial direct indications that factors such as global warming and cultural impacts have affected the environment. The Vigil Network provides an opportunity for earth and life scientists to participate in a systematic monitoring effort to detect landscape changes over time, and to relate such changes to possible causes. The Vigil Network is an ever-increasing group of sites and basins used to monitor landscape features with as much as 50 years of documented geomorphic and related observations. © 1991 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Environmental Effects; Monitoring; River Basins; Vigil Network; cultural impact; drainage basin; environment; global warming; landscape change; Vigil Network; USA",,,,,,"Emmett, W.W., The Vigil Network: Methods of measurement and a sampling of data collected (1965) Symposium of Budapest, pp. 89-106. , 28 September-1 October 1965, IAHS Publ. no. 66; Emmett, W.W., Channel aggradation in western United States as indicated by observations at Vigil Network sites (1974) Z.
