The main factor determining climate's temperature parameters is the atmospheric pressure. Glaciations at the end of Paleozoic-Phanerozoic time occurred due to a gradual atmospheric pressure decline as a result of nitrogen consumption by the nitrogen-consuming bacteria that removed nitrogen from the atmosphere and concentrated it in sediments. A warm period in the second half of Mesozoic was associated with the formation of the Pangaea supercontinent and intensified oxygen generation, which compensated for the lowered nitrogen partial pressure.","Adiabatic theory; Climate evolution; Global warming; Greenhouse gases","Atmospheric pressure; Bacteria; Greenhouse effect; Nitrogen; Sediments; Adiabatic theory; Climate evolution; Glaciations; Greenhouse gases; Global warming",,,,,,"Arrhenius, S., On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground (1896) Phil.
