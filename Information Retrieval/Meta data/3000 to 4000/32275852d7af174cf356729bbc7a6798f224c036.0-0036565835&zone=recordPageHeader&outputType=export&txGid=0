The groundwater model MODFLOW is calibrated and verified for the area and used to analyze the impacts of several mean and drought climate change scenarios. Pumping conditions and land use are assumed to remain the same as at present. The climate change scenarios result in either slightly higher, no different, or significantly less annual recharge and groundwater elevations, producing a variety of impacts on wetlands, water supply potential, and low flows. Impacts are most severe under some drought scenarios. The policy response to the possible impacts as recommended by the leader of a watershed advocacy group is that wise management of the aquifer should be advocated with a particular focus on limiting the expansion of water supply from the aquifer and increasing the present amount of groundwater recharge.","Climatic changes; Global warming; Groundwater; Massachusetts; Surface waters","Groundwater recharge; Global warming; Public policy; Water supply; Watersheds; Wetlands; Groundwater; climate change; global warming; recharge; unconfined aquifer; water budget; United States",,,,,,"Arnell, N., Jenkins, A., George, D.G., (1994) The Implications of Climate Change for the National River Authority, , National Rivers Authority, Bristol, U.K; Arnell, N., Bates, B., Lang, H., Magnuson, J., Mulkolland, P., Chapter 10: Hydrology and freshwater ecology (1996) Climate Change 1995, Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientific-technical Analyses, Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K; Bicknell, B.R., Imhoff, J.C., Kittle, J.L., Donigan, A.S., Johanson, R.C., (1996) HSPF-User's Manual for Release II, , Environmental Research Laboratory, U.S. EPA, Athens, Ga; Bouck, B.R., (1996) Upper Charles River Study-growth vs. Water Supply, , Massachusetts Dept. of Environmental Protection, Boston; Populatic pond diagnostic feasibility (1988) Final Rep.
