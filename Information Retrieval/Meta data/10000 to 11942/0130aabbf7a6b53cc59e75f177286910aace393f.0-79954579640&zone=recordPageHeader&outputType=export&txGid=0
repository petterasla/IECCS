On a global scale, livestock farming may contribute 18% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Though methane contribution is less than 2% of all the factors leading to global warming, it plays an important role because it is 21 times more effective than carbon dioxide. Methane emission is a direct result of the fermentation process performed by ruminal microorganisms and, in particular, the archael methanogens. Reducing methane emission would benefit both ruminant production and the environment. Methane generation can be reduced by electron-sink metabolic pathways to dispose of the reducing moieties. An alternative way for methane control in the rumen is to apply inhibitors against methanogens. Generating methane from manure has considerable merit because it appears to offer at least a partial solution to two pressing problems-environmental crisisand energy shortage. An obvious benefit from methane production is the energy value of the gas itself. Control of methane emission by rumen microbes in Korea has mainly been focused on application of various chemicals, such as BES and PMDI, that inhibit the growth and activity of methanogens in the rumen. Alternatives were to apply long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and oils with or without organic acids (malate and fumarate). The results for trials with methane reducing agents and the situation of biogas production industries and a typical biogas plant in Korea will be introduced here.","Biogas; Livestock manure; Methane; Methanogens; Ruminants","Bovidae",,,,,,"Asanuma, N., Iwamoto, M., Hino, T., Effect of the addition of fumarate on methane production by ruminal microorganisms in vitro (1999) Journal of Dairy Science, 82 (4), pp. 780-787; Choi, N.J., Lee, S.Y., Sung, H.G., Lee, S.C., Ha, J.K., Effects of halogenated compounds, organic acids and unsaturated fatty acids on in vitro methane production and fermentation characteristics (2004) Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences, 17 (9), pp. 1255-1259; Cieślak, A., Impact on rumen fermentation when feeding diets supplemented with rapeseed and linseed oil (2003) Proc.
