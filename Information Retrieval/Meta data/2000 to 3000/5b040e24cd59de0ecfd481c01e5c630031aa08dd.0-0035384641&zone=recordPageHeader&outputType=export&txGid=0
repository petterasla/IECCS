Despite great daily and seasonal changes in ambient air temperature, the gradient of air temperatures was simulated by 5°C warmed conditions at the air outlet, rising at a rate of 1°C at 5 m intervals. Also, CO2 concentrations were linearly increased from the air inlet to the outlet; those at the air inlet and 25 m distance from the air inlet were 372 p.p.m and 756 p.p.m. (doubled), respectively. The CTGC proved successful in biological experiments conducted through a full growth season in 1998. This apparatus will be useful for understanding plant response to simultaneous changes in CO2 and temperature. Being a combination of a TGC and a CO2 gradient chamber, the improved CTGC allows parameters and validation data sets to both be obtained for models contributing to plant growth, species composition, and global carbon flux analysis.","CO2-temperature gradient; Field-like conditions; Global warming; Plant population","carbon dioxide; climate change; ecological impact; environmental gradient; experimental apparatus; global warming; plant community; temperature",,,,,,"Bazzaz, F.A., The response of natural ecosystems to the rising global CO2 levels (1990) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 21, pp. 167-196; Bazzaz, F.A., Bassow, S.L., Berntson, G.M., Thomas, S.C., Elevated CO2 and terrestrial vegetation (1996) Implications for and Beyond the Global Carbon Budget: Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems, pp. 43-76. , (eds B.
