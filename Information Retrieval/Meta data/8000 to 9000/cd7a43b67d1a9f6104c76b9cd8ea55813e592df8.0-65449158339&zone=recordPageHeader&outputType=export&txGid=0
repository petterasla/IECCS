The increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases is expected to increase precipitation and evaporation proportionally. However, a few studies have shown a decreasing trend for evaporation over the last 50 years globally. In India, earlier works showed that there was a significant increasing temporal trend in surface temperature and a decreasing trend in grass reference ET (ETo). To study the temporal trend of ETo along with its regionwise spatial variation, 32 years (1971-2002) monthly meteorological data were collected for 133 selected stations evenly distributed over different agro-ecological regions (AERs) of India. ETo was estimated by the globally accepted Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Penman Monteith (PM) method (FAO-56 PM). These ETo values were then analyzed by a nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test (with modified effective sample size approach for serially correlated data) and Sen slope to determine the existence and magnitude of any statistically significant trend over the time period considered in this study. The same analysis was also performed on governing meteorological variables to identify the cause of existence of such trend in ETo. A significant decreasing trend was found in ETo all over India during the study period, which was mainly caused by a significant increase in the relative humidity and a consistent significant decrease in the wind speed throughout the country. However, a general increase in rainfall was not found in recent years. © 2009 ASCE.","Climatic changes; Estimation; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; India","Agro-ecological regions; Atmospheric concentrations; Climatic changes; Correlated datum; Food and agriculture organizations; India; Mann-Kendall; Meteorological datum; Meteorological variables; Non-parametric; Penman-monteith methods; Reference evapotranspirations; Relative humidities; Sample sizes; Spatial variations; Surface temperatures; Temporal trends; Time periods; Wind speed; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Climatology; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Evapotranspiration; Greenhouse gases; Permanent magnets; Surface properties; Vapors; Water supply; Global warming; evapotranspiration; global warming; greenhouse effect; Penman-Monteith equation; surface temperature; trend analysis; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",,,,,,"Allen, R.G., ""Evaluation of procedures for estimating mean monthly solar radiation from air temperature"" (1995) Rep., Food and Agric.
