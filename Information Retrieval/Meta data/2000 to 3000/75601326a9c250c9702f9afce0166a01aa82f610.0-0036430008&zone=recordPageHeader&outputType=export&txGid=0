One method employs conventional processes for the treatment of water and the other one is based on membrane filtration. All inputs (raw materials and energy) and outputs (products, by-products and emissions to air, water and soil) from the two methods were listed and quantified. These inputs and outputs cause different environmental impacts (global warming, ozone depletion, smog formation, acidification, nutrient enrichment, ecotoxicity and human toxicity) and the contribution of each method to each of these impact categories has been quantified, resulting in a score. The ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) methodological framework for life cycle assessments guided this study. By using these methodologies and by tracing all the processes involved in the production of potable water to the interface with the environment, it was found that the main contributor to the overall environmental burden is the generation of electricity. This conclusion is valid for both methods investigated and in order to increase the environmental performance in the production of potable water the energy efficiency of waterworks should be increased.","Conventional processes; Life cycle assessment; Membrane filtration; Potable water","Electricity; Environmental impact; Filtration; Global warming; Life cycle; Potable water; Raw materials; Toxicity; Ecotoxicity; Water treatment; chlorine; drinking water; ozone; developing world; environmental effect; wastewater; water quality; water resource; water treatment; environmental effect; wastewater; water quality; water resource; water treatment; acidification; air; chlorination; comparative study; conference paper; depletion; ecotoxicity; electricity; energy resource; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental monitoring; flocculation; greenhouse effect; membrane filter; ozonation; ozone layer; photooxidation; sedimentation; smog; soil; South Africa; standardization; water supply; water treatment; Environment; Filtration; Membranes, Artificial; Models, Theoretical; South Africa; Water Purification; Water Supply; South Africa",,"Membranes, Artificial",,,,"Friedrich, E., The use of environmental life cycle assessment for the production of potable water (2001), Masters Thesis, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Natal, Durban, South Africa(1992) Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Products - Guide, , Heijungs, R.
