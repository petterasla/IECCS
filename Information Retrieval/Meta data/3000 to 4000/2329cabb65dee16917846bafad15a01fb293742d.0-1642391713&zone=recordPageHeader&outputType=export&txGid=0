Arctic ecosystems are strongly constrained by temperature, and may be expected to be markedly influenced by climate change. Perturbation experiments have been used to predict how Arctic ecosystems will respond to global climatic change, but these have often simulated individual perturbations (e.g. temperature alone) and have largely been confined to the short Arctic summer. The importance of interactions between global change variables (e.g. CO2, temperature, precipitation) has rarely been examined, and much experimentation has been short-term. Similarly, very little experimentation has occurred in the winter when General circulation models predict the largest changes in climate will take place. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that Arctic ecosystems are not dormant during the winter and thus much greater emphasis on experimentation during this period is essential to improve our understanding of how these ecosystems will respond to global change. This, combined with more long-term experimentation, direct observation of natural vegetation change (e.g. at the tundra/taiga boundary) and improvements in model predictions is necessary if we are to understand the future nature and extent of Arctic ecosystems in a changing climate.","Arctic ecosystems; Climate change; Global warming; Perturbation experiments; Snowmelt","arctic environment; climate change; ecosystem response; general circulation model; global warming; precipitation (climatology); Arctic",,,,,,"Aanes, R., Saether, B.-E., Smith, F.M., Cooper, E.J., Wookey, P.A., Óritsland, N.A., The Arctic Oscillation predicts effects of climate change in two trophic levels in a high-arctic ecosystem (2002) Ecology Letters, 5, pp. 455-1453; (2002), http://www.ans.kiruna.seBilbrough, C.J., Welker, J.M., Bowman, W.D., Early spring nitrogen uptake by snow-cover plants: A comparison of Arctic and alpine plant function under the snowpack (2000) Arctic, Antarctic and Alpine Research, 32, pp. 404-411; Callaghan, T.V., Carlsson, B.A., Sonesson, M., Temesváry, A., Between-year variation in climate related growth of circumpolar populations of the moss Hylocomium splendens (1997) Functional Ecology, 11, pp. 157-165; Cattle, H., Crossley, J., Modelling Arctic climate Change (1995) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (a), 352, pp. 201-213; Chapin, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Laundre, J.A., Responses of Arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Chapman, W.L., Walsh, J.E., Recent variations of sea ice and air-temperature in high latitudes (1993) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 71, pp. 33-47; Crawford, R.M.M., (1989) Studies in Plant Survival: Ecological Case Histories of Plant Adaptation to Adversity, 296p. , Blackwell Scientific, Oxford; Crawford, R.M.M., Habitat fragility as an aid to long-term survival in Arctic vegetation (1997) Ecology of Arctic Environments, pp. 113-136. , eds S.
