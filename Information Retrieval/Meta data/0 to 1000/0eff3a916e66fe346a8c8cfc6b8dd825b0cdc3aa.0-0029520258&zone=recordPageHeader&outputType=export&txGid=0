Changes in snow cover may provide an indicator of global climatic trends and are of considerable practical significance. The question of the most suitable indices of changes in snow cover conditions, in terms of their use for change detection and for monitoring applications, is discussed. The use of passive microwave-derived estimates of snow cover extent and water equivalent for continental and regional-scale mapping is illustrated. Problems in interpreting the microwave signatures, as well as difficulties in comparing such data to ground observations, are also noted. -from Authors",,"monitoring; satellite microwave data; snow cover; snow data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03091333,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029520258
