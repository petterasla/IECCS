These data, which now cover the 1882-1984 period, are examined in parallel with humidity and cloud cover data for the same period. From the beginning to the end of this period, observations show that the mean night-time temperature has increased by 2.39°C 100 yr while the mean daytime temperature has decreased by 0.50°C 100 yr. In consequence, the mean annual diurnal temperature range has dropped by 36% 100 yr. The maximum seasonal decrease is 46% 100 yr in spring. Season-to-season and year-to-year inter-relationships between minimum temperature, maximum temperature, relative humidity and cloud cover suggest that the decrease in maximum temperature is related to a concomitant increase of 15% 100 yr in both relative humidity and cloud cover. © 1995.",,"cloud clover; temperature data (1882-1984); temperature rise; France, Pyrenees, Pic du Midi",,,,,,"Bücher, Dessens, Secular trend of surface temperature at an elevated observatory in the Pyrenees (1991) Journal of Climate, 4, pp. 859-868; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change (1990) The IPCC Scientific Assessment, p. 365. , J.T.
