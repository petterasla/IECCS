The environmental performance of steel can affect those of the downstream products. In this work, environmental impacts of individual steels, i.e. slab, hot-rolled, cold-rolled, hot-dipped galvanized, and electro-galvanized steels, were studied, via life cycle assessment. The impact assessment methods of IPCC 2007 GWP 100a and Eco-indicator 99 (H) were used to cover the impact categories of Global warming potential, Fossil fuels, Ecotoxicity, Minerals, Carcinogens, and Respiratory inorganics. In all categories, the slab showed the lowest impacts and the hot-dipped galvanized steel showed the highest impacts. The main causes of the impacts were attributed to these inputs; steel, energy, and zinc. The emissions from steel production plants showed relatively low impacts. Small amount of zinc input can cause huge environmental impacts. The impacts of Fossil fuels, Minerals, and Ecotoxicity, of 1-kg zinc were 2.9, 116.9, and 39.6 times of those caused by 1-kg cold-rolled steel, respectively. The reduction of zinc consumption and the improvement of zinc production process, in terms of reduction of heavy metal emissions, could largely improve environmental performance of the galvanized steels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy; Galvanization; Life cycle assessment; Steel; Zinc","Cold-rolled steel; Eco-Indicator 99; Ecotoxicity; Energy; Environmental performance; Galvanization; Galvanized steels; Global warming potential; Heavy metal emissions; Hot-rolled; Impact assessments; Inorganics; Life cycle assessment; Life-cycle assessments; Steel production; Thailand; Zinc production; Emission control; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Galvanized metal; Galvanizing; Global warming; Heavy metals; Life cycle; Steel sheet; Steelmaking; Zinc; Environmental impact; carcinogen; ecotoxicology; emission; environmental impact assessment; fossil fuel; global warming; industrial production; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; life cycle analysis; mineral; steel; zinc; Thailand",,,,,,"(2009) Steel statistical yearbook 2008, , http://www.worldsteel.org/pictures/publicationfiles/SSY2008%5B1%5D.pdf, World Steel Association, World Steel Association, Brussels, See also:; (2009) Statistical yearbook 2009, , Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand (ISIT), ISIT, Bangkok; Gerst, M., Graedel, T., In-use stocks of metals: status and implications (2008) Environmental Science & Technology, 42 (19), pp. 7038-7045; Berkel, R., Eco-efficiency in primary metals production: context, perspectives and methods (2007) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 51 (3), pp. 511-540; Zhang, X., Jiang, W., Deng, S., Peng, K., Energy evaluation of the sustainability of Chinese steel production during 1998-2004 (2009) Journal of Cleaner Production, 17, pp. 1030-1038; (2006) 14040 Environmental management - life cycle assessment - principles and framework, , ISO - International Organization for Standardization, ISO, Geneva, Switzerland; Finnveden, G., Hauschild, M.Z., Ekvall, T., Guine, J., Heijungs, R., Hellweg, S., Recent developments in life cycle assessment (2009) Journal of Environmental Management, 91, pp. 1-21; http://www.resilience.osu.edu/CFR-site/eco-lca.htm, Center for Resilience, Ohio State University.
