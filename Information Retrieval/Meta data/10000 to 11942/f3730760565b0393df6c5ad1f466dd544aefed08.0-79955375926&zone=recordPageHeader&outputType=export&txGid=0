The main problems of the thermal radiation and convection can be also linked to the influence of the gases on the evolution of global warming. The main element of the system, permitting the evaluation of the thermal and dynamic aspects and its dynamic, is the intensity of the heat exchange. In order to analyse this problem, a model needs to consider: the convection, the radiation and the heat exchange in the atmosphere. The objective is to establish a correlation between the components, the thermal source and the equilibrium of the system. Based on a proposed model, the paper considers some aspects regarding the problems of the thermal convection in the troposphere. The present work tries to analyse some particularities of the convection in the troposphere establishing the variation of the temperature, the turbulence and the speed of the air streams influenced by general and local physical properties of the air. The solutions have to take into account more complex situations in the atmosphere. Finally, the goal of the model is to bring a contribution to the questions on the climate changes.","Air; Atmosphere; Convection; Dynamics; Temperature","air temperature; climate change; cloud cover; thermal convection; troposphere; turbulence",,,,,,"Schlesinger, M.E., Model projections of the climatic changes induced by increased atmospheric CO 2 (1989) Climate and Geo-Sciences, pp. 275-415. , Eds A.
