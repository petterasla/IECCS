Yet because human-induced climate change will most hurt the poorest on the planet, seriously reduce the quality of life for future generations, and threaten plants and animals around the world, global warming must be understood to raise very serious ethical issues. In fact, because global warming policy options will likely determine which people, plants and animals will live and die, human-induced climate change must be understood to raise the most momentous ethical dilemma. This is particularly the case because those who currently emit the most greenhouse gases are not likely those who will be most harmed by global warming. Yet despite the profound ethical questions raised by global warming, most of the debate in the United States and many other nations has been concerned with issues such as scientific certainty about global warming impacts and economic cost of climate change programs, arguments that pretend to be ethically neutral but often hide dubious ethical positions. For instance, if a nation refuses to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions until science can describe global warming impacts with high levels of confidence, such nation is implicitly asking the victim of global warming to bear the burden of risk in light of the fact that harm may be experienced before scientific uncertainties are resolved. For this reason, insisting on high levels of scientific proof before ceasing high-risk behavior is an ethical question often hidden in arguments about science.",,"environmental issue; environmental policy; ethics; global warming; Animalia",,,,,,"Brown, D., (2002) American Heat: Ethical Problems With the United States Response to Global Warming; Summary for policy makers (2001) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report, , http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/syr/pdf/fourthvolume.pdf, [hereinafter 2001 IPCC Synthesis], available at (visited on November 5); Stevens, W., Experts doubt a greenhouse gas can be curbed (1997) N.Y Times, pp. A1. , Nov. 3; Harris, P.G., Considerations of equity and international institutions (1996) Envtl.
