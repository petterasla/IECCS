Water temperature is a key characteristic of stream ecosystems that is gaining scientific and managerial relevance as maximum temperatures in aquatic ecosystems increase worldwide. 2. To assess the effect of surface-subsurface water exchange on stream water temperature patterns, four alluvial reaches in the Tagliamento River basin (NE Italy), constrained by geomorphic knickpoints at the upper and lower end, and two to four hyporheic flowpaths within each reach, were continuously studied during summer 2007 and winter 2007-08. Water temperature was continuously monitored at the upstream and downstream knickpoints of the floodplains, as well as at discrete upwelling areas within each reach. Discharge and vertical hydraulic gradient were measured along the alluvial reaches, and the residence time and chemistry of upwelling water were assessed four times during the study. 3. Discharge variation along the study reaches revealed that massive hyporheic exchange occurred in all sites, ranging from 21% in reach 2-52% in reach 1. End member mixing analysis showed little influence of ground water, as almost all upwelling water was freshly infiltrated hyporheic water. Importantly, hyporheic exchange flows shaped surface temperature at the upwelling locations in all study reaches, providing potential thermal refugia for aquatic biota. At sites with highest hyporheic flow rates, net temperature change was also reflected at the floodplain scale. 4. The magnitude of the thermal change along a hyporheic flowpath was not related to the flowpath length but to the estimated 222Rn water age. Reduction in the diel thermal amplitude by hyporheic flows rather than net temperature change, reduced temperature extremes. Therefore, restoration activities to create thermal refugia should consider the role of hyporheic flows and enhance the exchange between surface and hyporheic waters. © 2008 The Authors.","Floodplain ecology; Global warming; Hyporheic zone; Thermal refugia; Water temperature",,,,,,,"Acuña, V., Dahm, C.N., Impact of monsoonal rains on spatial scaling patterns in water chemistry of a semiarid river network (2007) Journal of Geophysical Research - Biogeosciences, 112. , G04009. doi:; Acuña, V., Wolf, A., Uehlinger, U., Tockner, K., Temperature dependence of stream benthic respiration in an Alpine river network with relevance to global warming (2008) Freshwater Biology, 53, pp. 2076-2088; Adams, P.W., Policy and management for headwater streams in the Pacific Northwest: Synthesis and reflection (2007) Forest Science, 53, pp. 104-118; Alexander, M.D., Caissie, D., Variability and comparison of hyporheic water temperatures and seepage fluxes in a small Atlantic salmon stream (2003) Ground Water, 41, pp. 72-82; Arscott, D.B., Tockner, K., Ward, J.V., Thermal heterogeneity along a braided floodplain river (Tagliamento River, northeastern Italy) (2001) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 58, pp. 2359-2373; Battin, J., Wiley, M.W., Ruckelshaus, M.H., Palmer, R.N., Korb, E., Bartz, K.K., Imaki, H., Projected impacts of climate change on salmon habitat restoration (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104, pp. 6720-6725; Baxter, C., Hauer, F.R., Woessner, W.W., Measuring groundwater-stream water exchange: New techniques for installing minipiezometers and estimating hydraulic conductivity (2003) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 132, pp. 493-502; Beschta, R.L., Taylor, R.L., Stream temperature increases and land-use in a forested Oregon watershed (1988) Water Resources Bulletin, 24, pp. 19-25; Bilby, R.E., Characteristics and frequency of cool-water areas in a western Washington stream (1984) Journal of Freshwater Ecology, 2, pp. 593-602; Boulton, A.J., Hyporheic rehabilitation in rivers: Restoring vertical connectivity (2007) Freshwater Biology, 52, pp. 632-650; Brunke, M., Gonser, T., The ecological significance of exchange processes between rivers and groundwater (1997) Freshwater Biology, 37, pp. 1-33; Burns, D.A., McDonnell, J.J., Hooper, R.P., Peters, N.E., Freer, J.E., Kendall, K., Beven, K., Quantifying contributions to storm runoff through end member mixing analysis and hydrologic measurements at the Panola Mountain Research Watershed (2001) Hydrological Processes, 15, pp. 1903-1924; Cardenas, M.B., Wilson, J.L., Zlotnik, V.A., Impact of heterogeneity, bed forms, and stream curvature on subchannel hyporheic exchange (2004) Water Resources Research, 40. , W08307; Chen, Y.D., Carsel, R.F., McCutcheon, S.C., Nutter, W.L., Stream temperature simulation of forested riparian areas: I.
