The behaviour of storm waves in the nearshore is thus one of the most important factors in carrying out risk management and mitigation processes. This paper focuses on the analysis of storm wave data collected in across surfzone during by Cyclone Hamish in 2009. The data was collected by means of a manometer tube system and were analyzed by two different method namely wave-by-wave time domain approach and frequency domain approach. The data is then used to evaluate existing empirical surfzone wave transformation formulae and provides a reliable base for developing more detailed storm wave transformation models.","Empirical wave parameter; Field study; Monometer tubes; Storm waves; Tropical cyclones; Wave setup","coastal zone; environmental factor; frequency analysis; global warming; nearshore environment; numerical model; risk assessment; storm; transformation; tropical cyclone; Australia; Queensland",,,,,,"Cartwright, N., Callaghan, D.P., Nielsen, P., (2009) Coastal Field Research Facility: The Spit, Gold Coast, , Australia, The University of Queensland; Nairn, R.B., (1990) Prediction of Cross-shore Sediment Transport and Beach Profile Evolution, , University of London, London, England; Nielsen, P., Local approximations: A new way of dealing with irregular waves (1986) Proc. 20th Int.
