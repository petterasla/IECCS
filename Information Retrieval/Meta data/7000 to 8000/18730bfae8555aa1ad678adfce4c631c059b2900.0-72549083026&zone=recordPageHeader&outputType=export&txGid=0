However, accounting of biogenic CO2 emissions and sequestered biogenic carbon in landfills and in soils, amended with compost, is carried out in different ways in reported studies. A simplified model of carbon flows is presented for the waste management system and the surrounding industries, represented by the pulp and paper manufacturing industry, the forestry industry and the energy industry. The model calculated the load of C to the atmosphere, under ideal conditions, for 14 different waste management scenarios under a range of system boundary conditions and a constant consumption of C-product (here assumed to be paper) and energy production within the combined system. Five sets of criteria for assigning GWP indices to waste management systems were applied to the same 14 scenarios and tested for their ability to rank the waste management alternatives reflecting the resulting CO2 load to the atmosphere. Two complete criteria sets were identified yielding fully consistent results; one set considers biogenic CO2 as neutral, the other one did not. The results showed that criteria for assigning global warming contributions are partly linked to the system boundary conditions. While the boundary to the paper industry and the energy industry usually is specified in LCA studies, the boundary to the forestry industry and the interaction between forestry and the energy industry should also be specified and accounted for.","Biogenic carbon; Carbon balances; Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestering; Fossil carbon; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; LCA modelling; System boundaries; Waste management","Carbon balance; Carbon balances; Carbon-sequestering; Fossil carbon; LCA modelling; System boundaries; System boundary; Boundary conditions; Carbon dioxide; Composting; Energy conversion; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Life cycle; Paper and pulp industry; Renewable energy resources; Timber; Waste management; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; compost; global warming; greenhouse gas; landfill; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; modeling; waste management; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; composting; criterion variable; energy resource; energy yield; environmental parameters; forestry; global warming potential; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; landfill; life cycle assessment; paper industry; priority journal; pulp mill; review; waste management; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Models, Theoretical; Waste Management; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Chelation; Composting; Forestry; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Greenhouses; Life Cycle; Renewable Resources; Waste Management",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Air Pollutants; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Bogner, J., Ahmed, M., Diaz, C., Faaij, A., Gao, Q., Hashimoto, S., Mareckova, K., Zhang, T., Waste management (2007) Climate Change 2007: Mitigation.
