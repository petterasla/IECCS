The aim of the present study is to evaluate, through LCA, the potential environmental impact associated to urban waste dumping in a sanitary landfill for four case studies and to compare different technologies for waste treatment and leachate or biogas management in the framework of the EPD® system. Specific data were collected on the four Italian landfills during a five-year campaign from 2000 to 2004. This work also analyses the comparability of EPD results for different products in the same product category. For this purpose, a critical review of PSR 2003:3, for preparing an EPD on 'Collection, transfer and disposal service for urban waste in sanitary landfills', is performed. Methods. PSR 2003:3 defines the requirements, based on environmental parameters, that should be considered in an LCA study for collecting and disposal service of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in a sanitary landfill. It defines functional unit, system boundaries towards nature, other technical systems and boundaries in time, cut-off rules, allocation rules and parameters to be declared in the EPD. This PSR is tested on four case studies representing the major landfills located from the farthest west to the farthest east side of the Ligurian Region. Those landfills are managed with different technologies as concerns waste pre-treatment and leachate or biogas treatment. For each landfill, a life cycle assessment study is performed. Results and Discussion. The comparison of the LCA results is performed separately for the following phases: transport, landfill, leachate and biogas. The following parameters are considered: Resource use (Use of non-renewable resources with and without energy content, Use of renewable resources with and without energy content, Water consumption); Pollutant emissions expressed as potential environmental impact (Global Warming Potential from biological and fossil sources, Acidification, Ozone depletion, Photochemical oxidant formation, Eutrophication, Land use, Hazardous and other Waste production). The comparison of the LCA results obtained for alternative landfill and biogas management techniques in the case studies investigated shows that the best practicable option that benefits the environment as a whole must be identified and chosen in the LCA context. For example, a strong waste pre-treatment causes a high biological GWP in the landfill phase, but a low GWP contribution in the biogas phase, due to the consequent low biogas production, evaluated for 30 years since landfill closure. Conclusion. The analysis of four case studies showed that, through the EPD tool, it is possible to make a comparison among different declarations for the same product category only with some modification and integration to existent PSR 2003:3. Results showed that different products have different performances for phases and impact categories. It is not possible to identify the 'best product' from an environmental point of view, but it is possible to identify the product (or service) with the lowest impact on the environment for each impact category and resource use. Recommendation and Perspective. In consequences of the verification of the comprehensiveness of existent PSR 2003:3 for the comparability of EPD, some modifications and integration to existent rules are suggested. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Environmental Product Declaration (EPD); Italy; Landfill, sanitary; Municipal Solid Waste (MSW); Product Category Rules (PCR); Product-Specific Requirements (PSR); Specific rules, type III label; Waste disposal","biogas; article; environmental impact; landfill; landfill leachate; life cycle assessment; priority journal; waste disposal; waste management",,,,,,"(1997) ISO 14040: Environmental management - Life-cycle assessment - Principles and framework, , ISO , International Organisation for Standardisation; Del Borghi, A., Binaghi, L., Del Borghi, M., Gallo, M., Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) As A Tool Of Sustainable Design For Waste Management (2003) Chemical Engineering Transactions, 3, pp. 745-750; Finnveden, G., Methodological aspects of life cycle assessment of integrated solid waste management systems (1999) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 26, pp. 173-187; Finnveden, G., Johansson, J., Lind, P., Moberg, A., Life cycle assessment of energy from solid waste - part 1: General methodology and results (2004) Journal of Cleaner Production, , in press; ISO (2003): ISO CD 14025.1: Environmental Labels and Declarations - Type III Environmental Declarations - Principles and procedures.
