Two main gradients were found. The first ordination axis clearly relates to a gradient in forest vegetation succession, the second to a gradient in peat nutrient level and pH. The secondary succession towards forest vegetation started soon after drainage and proceeded most rapidly on the most nutrient-rich site types. This led to a more uniform vegetation composition between the site types. Original mire species reacted differently to the changing post-drainage environment. Tall sedges (Carex lasiocarpa, C. rostrata), disappeared soon after drainage. The coverage of the mire dwarf shrubs gradually decreased with increasing tree stand volumes; Betula nana appears to have been the most sensitive species. Coverages of the Sphagna studied appear to have decreased in response to increasing tree stand shading in the order: S. fuscum > S. recurvum complex > S. magellanicum > S. russowii. The development towards forest vegetation on mires may diminish the regional (gamma-) diversity on forest-dominated landscapes, even if the species (alpha-) diversity on individual sites is little affected. Long-term vegetation changes after artificial water level drawdown can be used to mimic the effects of the predicted global climatic warming on mire vegetation. -from Authors",,"drawdown; global warming; mire; pH; pine mire; secondary succession; sedge; succession; Finland; Betula nana; Carex lasiocarpa; Carex rostrata; Cyperaceae; Rostrata; Sphagnum fuscum; Sphagnum magellanicum; Sphagnum recurvum; Sphagnum russowii",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028995526
