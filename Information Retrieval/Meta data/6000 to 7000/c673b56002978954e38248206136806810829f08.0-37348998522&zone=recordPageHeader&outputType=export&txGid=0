Results showed that totally 26 species were identified. The Ostracoda diversity was opposite to the change of its density in most seasons which reflected an uneven assignment of Ostracoda density among its different species. The Ostracoda density was 0.70 ind./m3 in spring, 1.72 ind./m3 in summer, 2.57 ind./m3 in autumn and 0.90 ind./m3 in winter. Euconchoecia chierchiae in spring and winter, Euconchoecia maimai in summer and Cypridina dentata in autumn were main dominant species in each season. The Ostracoda density did not show an obvious linear relationship with the hydrologic factors in summer and autumn, but was related to the surface salinity in spring and the surface temperature in winter. Its high density areas mainly distributed in the north offshore in all the seasons while in the south offshore in winter and in spring, and the south nearshore in summer and autumn, implied the zooplankton was a typical warm water animal, whose high density distribution in autumn were located in a similar position to Todarodes pacificus, Navodon Septentrionalis, Scomber japonicus and other fishes in the sea, so as to be an important indicator for fishing ground. The main species dominating in Ostracoda now are different from the species twenty years ago probably attributes to global warming.","Distribution; Diversity; East China Sea; Ostracoda; Zooplankton","community composition; ostracod; population density; species diversity; zooplankton; East China Sea; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Cypridina; Euconchoecia; Euconchoecia chierchiae; Ostracoda; Pisces; Scomber japonicus; Todarodes pacificus",,,,,,"Ruixiang, C., Distribution of planktonic Ostracoda a-long the west of the Taiwan Strait (1982) Acta Oceanologica Sinica, 4 (5), pp. 617-625. , in Chinese; Ruixiang, C., The planktonic Ostracoda in the offshore area of the East China Sea (1982) Marine Science Bulletin, 1 (6), pp. 45-67. , in Chinese; Ruixiang, C., Jinghong, L., Distribution of planktonic Ostracoda in Kuroshio and the west of the Taiwan Strait (1992) Acta Oceanologica Sinica, 14 (15), pp. 101-106. , in Chinese; Ruixiang, C., Jinghong, L., Ecological characteristies of planktonic Ostracoda in the South Yellow Sea and the East China Sea (1993) Acta Oceanologica Sinica, 15 (5), pp. 104-111. , in Chinese; Ruixiang, C., Jinghong, L., Ecological study of planktonic Ostracoda in the middle of the South China Sea (1993) Acta Oceanologica Sinica, 15 (6), pp. 91-98. , in Chinese; Ruixiang, C., Jinghong, L., Large-scale ecological study on planktonic Ostracoda in China' s seas and adjacent waters - I.
