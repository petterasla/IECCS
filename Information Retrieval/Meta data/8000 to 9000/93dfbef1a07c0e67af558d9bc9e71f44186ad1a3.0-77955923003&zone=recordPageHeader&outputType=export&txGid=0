Five years (2000-2004) of data from 614 non-polluted, soft-bottom stations from the National Coastal Assessment were analyzed. Multi-dimensional scaling done on Bray-Curtis similarity matrices of species' relative abundance (547 species) suggested seven subregions: two based on salinity (oligohaline, mesohaline) and five based on latitude. Species' distribution patterns for stations with salinities ≥18 (n = 558) were strongly influenced by latitude; Cape Cod was a clear faunal transition zone (R = 0.92, p < 0.001). Conversely, for stations with salinities <18 (n = 56), salinity was the more important factor. An ordination of abiotic variables (temperature, salinity, sediment percent silt-clay, depth) correlated well with the ordination of species' relative abundance data (R = 0.77, p < 0.001). The first split of a multivariate regression tree was by a summer bottom temperature of 20°C at Cape Cod. Salinity and percent silt-clay led to further splits. These results support the existence of Virginian and Transhatteran biogeographic provinces. They constitute a baseline for addressing broad-scale and long-term issues such as global climate change, species invasions, and conservation planning. © 2010 U.S. Government.","Acadian biogeographical province; Biogeography; Marine benthic ecology; Northeast US coast; Northwestern Atlantic; Virginian biogeographical province","benthos; biogeographical region; biogeography; climate change; conservation planning; geographical distribution; macroinvertebrate; multivariate analysis; relative abundance; sea surface salinity; sea surface temperature; soft-bottom environment; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Cape Cod; Delaware Bay; Massachusetts; Passamaquoddy Bay; United States",,,,,,"Anderson, D.M., Kulis, D.M., Doucette, F.J., Gallagher, J.C., Balech, E., Biogeography of toxic dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium from the northeastern United States and Canada (1994) Marine Biology, 120, pp. 467-478; Anraku, M., Influence of the Cape Cod Canal on the hydrography and on the copepods in Buzzards Bay and Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts.
