The CO2 gas samples were measured by using an infra-red analyzer (IRGA). The results showed that (i) CO2 emission was detected from all kinds of the snow-covered grounds, which provides direct evidence that the arctic tundra is functioning as a source of atmospheric CO2; (ii) CO2 release was also detected from the permanent ice profile and icecap, and (iii) CO2 evolution from terrestrial ecosystems in higher latitudes increased with an increase of surface temperature in accordance with the exponential function. This indicates a close coincidence with that under normal temperature conditions, and provides a useful method for predicting change in CO2 flux in the arctic ecosystems with the global climate change.","Arctic; CO2 emission; High latitudes; Icecap","arctic environment; carbon dioxide; ice sheet; temporal variation; Canada",,,,,,"Post, W.M., Emanuel, W.R., Zinke, P.J., Soil carbon pools and world life zones (1982) Nature, 298, p. 156; Fang, J., Carbon cycle in the arctic terrestrial ecosystems in relation to the global warming (1998) Acta Scientiae Circumstantiae (in Chinese), 18, p. 113; Raich, J.W., Schlesinger, W.H., The global carbon dioxide flux in soil respiration and its relationship to vegetation and climate (1992) Tellus, 44 B, p. 81; Oechel, W.C., Billings, W.D., (1992) Arctic Ecosystems in a Changing Climate, , New York : Academic Press; D'Arrigo, R., Gordon, C.J., Fung, I.Y., Boreal forests and atmosphere-biosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (1987) Nature, 329, p. 321; Poole, D.K., Miller, P.C., Carbon dioxide flux from three arctic tundra types in north-central Alaska, USA (1982) Arctic and Alpine Research, 14, p. 27; Zimov, S.A., Semiletov, I.P., Daviodov, S.P., Wintertime CO2 emission from soils of northeastern Siberia (1993) Arctic, 46, p. 197; Oechel, W.C., Vourlitis, G.L., Changes in arctic CO2 flux over two decades: Effect of climate change at Barrow, Alaska (1995) Ecological Applications, 5, p. 846; Billings, W.D., Arctic tundra: A source or sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide in a changing environment?
