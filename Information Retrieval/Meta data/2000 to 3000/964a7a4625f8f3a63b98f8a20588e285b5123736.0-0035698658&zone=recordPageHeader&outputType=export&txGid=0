Agricultural and related goods transport has increased steadily in the recent decades, and empty haulage is common (up to about 45%) in the sector. The resulting transport intensification leads to environmental degradation by contributing to air pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, resource depletion, congestion and traffic accidents. The main objective of the current work is to map out the material flow and to investigate the possibilities of coordinated transport of agricultural produce and agricultural means of production, supported by information technology. It is assumed that the information achieved through this investigation will assist to develop an effective transport-logistics system, which may enable an efficient utilization of vehicles to meet the current demand for attenuating environmental impacts. Data collection on daily goods distribution and collection including geographical location of collections/distribution points and routes was done using the global positioning system, GPS. A total of 196 routes were measured and optimization of goods distribution/collection and route was done made using the gathered data to estimate the environmental benefit. Possibilities and constraints of coordinated goods distribution and collection were analysed. Optimization of routes and distribution/collection and the computed emissions from the vehicles as a result of optimization are presented. © 2001 Silsoe Research Institute.",,,,,,,,"Anlér, N., (1999), Interview, from Johan Hansson AB grain trade, Uppsala, SwedenArla, (1999), Unpublished material.
