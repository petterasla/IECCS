Southern Greenland coastal and Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures were uncorrelated between the 1960s and early 1990s but were significantly positively correlated thereafter. This relationship appears to have been modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation, whose summer index was significantly (negatively) correlated with southern Greenland summer temperatures until the early 1990s but not thereafter. Significant warming in southern Greenland since ∼1990, as also evidenced from Swiss Camp on the west flank of the ice sheet, therefore reflects general Northern Hemisphere and global warming. Summer 2003 was the warmest since at least 1958 in coastal southern Greenland. The second warmest coastal summer 2005 had the most extensive anomalously warm conditions over the ablation zone of the ice sheet, which caused a record melt extent. The year 2006 was the third warmest in coastal southern Greenland and had the third-highest modeled runoff in the last 49 yr from the ice sheet; five of the nine highest runoff years occurred since 2001 inclusive. Significantly rising runoff since 1958 was largely compensated by increased precipitation and snow accumulation. Also, as observed since 1987 in a single composite record at Summit, summer temperatures near the top of the ice sheet have declined slightly but not significantly, suggesting the overall ice sheet is experiencing a dichotomous response to the recent general warming: possible reasons include the ice sheet's high thermal inertia, higher atmospheric cooling, or changes in regional wind, cloud, and/or radiation patterns. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Clouds; Ice; Precipitation (meteorology); Runoff; Snow; Wind effects; Atmospheric cooling; Ice sheet melt; Snow accumulation; Summer; Thermal inertia; Global warming; climate effect; global warming; ice sheet; meltwater; North Atlantic Oscillation; Northern Hemisphere; runoff; snow accumulation; summer; temperature effect; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet",,,,,,"Abdalati, W., Steffen, K., Snowmelt on the Greenland ice sheet as derived from passive microwave satellite data (1997) J.
