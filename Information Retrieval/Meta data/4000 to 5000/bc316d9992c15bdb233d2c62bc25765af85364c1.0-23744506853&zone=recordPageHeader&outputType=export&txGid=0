Surface and short-core sediments from the Lunawa Estuary were collected, and analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, sulfur and hydrocarbon contents, hydrogen index and other related sediment properties. Water quality and surface sediment data indicate that the Lunawa Estuary is presently an anoxic water body. The upper part of the sediment cores, characterized by very high TOC values of more than 10%, and absence of bioturbation along with strong laminations indicate anoxic water since 1970 AD, determined by 14 C dating. However, before 1970 AD, lower TOC content and presence of bioturbation and homogenous sediments with animal traces suggest the presence of oxic bottom water and thus a much better physicochemical condition. The lower part of the cores may also suggest the influence of gradual global warming. Regular laminations in the upper portions of the cores probably resulted from monsoon pulses with material preserved under anoxic condition. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Anoxia; Lunawa Estuary; Organic matter; Sri Lanka; TOC","Carbon; Estuaries; Geochronology; Global warming; Hydrogen; Water pollution; Anoxia; Lunawa estuary; Organic matter; Sri Lanka; Total organic carbons (TOC); Sediments; estuarine pollution; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; South Asia; Sri Lanka; World; Animalia",,,,,,"Alwis, P.D., Ariyarathna, S., Azmy, S.A.M., Dassanayake, N.H., Environmental pollution and its impact on the fishery management: Lunawa Estuary (1994) Sri Lanka Information, 8, pp. 1-15; Anderson, R.F., Lyons, T.W., Cowie, G.L., Sedimentary record of a shoaling of the oxic/anoxic interface in the Black Sea (1994) Mar Geol, 116 (3-4), pp. 373-384; Bechtel, A., Gratzer, R., Püttmann, W., Oszczepalski, S., Geochemical characteristics across the oxic/anoxic interface (Rote Fäule front) within the Kupferschiefer of the Lubin-Sieroszowice mining district (SW Poland) (2002) Chem Geo, 185 (1-2), p. 15; Bray, E.E., Evans, E.D., Distribution of n-paraffin as a clue to the recognition of source beds (1961) Geochim Cosmochim Acta, 22, pp. 2-9; Buesseler, K.O., Livingston, H.D., Casso, S.A., Mixing between oxic and anoxic waters of the Black Sea as traced by Chernobyl cesium isotopes (1991) Deep Sea Res I, 38 (SUPPL.), pp. 725-745; Claridge, P.N., Potter, I.C., Hardisty, M.W., Seasonal changes in movements, abundance, size composition and diversity of the fish fauna of the Severn Estuary (1986) J Mar Biol Ass UK, 66, pp. 229-258; Conley, D.J., Biogeochemical nutrient cycles and nutrient management strategies (2000) Hydrobiologia, 419, pp. 87-96; Demaison, G.J., Moore, G.T., Anoxic environments and oil source bed genesis (1980) Am Assoc Pet Geol Bull, 64, pp. 1179-1209; Espitalie, J., Senga Makadi, K., Trichet, J., Role of the mineral matrix during kerogen pyrolysis (1984) Org Geochem, 6, pp. 365-382; Hedges, J.I., Clark, W.A., Quay, P.D., Richey, J.E., Devol, A.H., Santos, U.D.M., Compositions and fluxes of particulate organic material in the Amazon River (1986) Limnol Oceanogr, 31, pp. 717-738; Johnson, B.L.C., Scrivenor, M.L.M., (1981) Sri Lanka: Land, People and Economy, p. 145. , Heinemann Educational Books Ltd., London; Kigata, Y., Morishita, H., Yonenbe, Y., Hattor, Y., 14C concentration in tree trunks (1991) Seminars in Researches Using AMS at Nagoya University (IV), pp. 88-93; Meyers, P.A., Ishiwatari, R., The Early Diagenesis of organic matter in lacustrine sediments (1993) Organic Geochemistry Principles and Applications, pp. 1-17. , Engel MH, Macko SA (eds) Plenum, New York; Mirlean, M., Andrus, V.E., Baisch, P., Griep, G., Casartelli, M.R., Arsenic pollution in Patos Estuary estuarine sediments, Brazil (2003) Mar Pollut Bull, 46 (11), pp. 1480-1484; Nichols, P.D., Volkman, J.K., Palmisano, A.C., Smith, G.A., White, D.C., Occurrence of an isoprenoid C25 diunsaturated alkene and high natural lipid content in Antarctic sea-ice diatom communities (1988) J Phycol, 24, pp. 90-96; Paerl, H.W., Coastal eutrophication and harmful algal blooms: Importance of atmospheric deposition and groundwater as new nitrogen and other nutrient sources (1997) Limnol Oceanogr, 42, pp. 1154-1165; Pedersen, T.F., Calvert, S.E., Anoxia vs. productivity: What controls the formation of organic carbon-rich sediments and sedimentary rocks?
