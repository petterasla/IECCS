Two conceptual daily rainfall-runoff models are used to simulate runoff across the Macquarie-Castlereagh region for historical (1895-2006) and future (∼2030) climate based on outputs from 15 of the 23 IPCC AR4 GCMs for the A1B global warming scenario. The estimates of future runoff are used as inputs to the river system model. The mean annual historical rainfall averaged across the Macquarie-Castlereagh region is 544 mm and the simulated runoff is 34 and 30 mm for SIMHYD and Sacramento rainfall-runoff models, respectively. The mean annual future rainfall and runoff across the region are projected to decrease. The modelling results show a median estimate of a 5% reduction for SIMHYD (50% confidence interval - 11 to + 7%) and a 7% reduction for Sacramento (50% confidence interval - 15 to + 8%) in mean annual runoff under a ∼2030 climate for the region. The results from the river system modelling indicate that under the ∼2030 climate scenario, the median of general security and supplementary diversions are projected to decrease by 4% (50% confidence interval - 10 to + 5%) and 2% (50% confidence interval - 5 to + 3%) respectively for the SIMHYD inflows and 8% (50% confidence interval - 17 to + 6%) and 5% (50% confidence interval - 11 to + 3%) for the Sacramento inflows. The future annual and seasonal storage volumes for the Burrendong Dam and inflows at all major locations across the region are projected to be lower than the historical records. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..","Climate change; Rainfall-runoff modelling; River system modelling; Storage behaviour; Water allocation","Annual runoff; Australia; Climate scenarios; Confidence interval; Future climate; Historical records; Rainfall-runoff modelling; Rainfall-runoff models; River basins; River system modelling; River systems; Runoff generation; Seasonal storage; Water allocation; Water availability; Catchments; Computer simulation; Global warming; Rain; Rivers; Runoff; Water management; Watersheds; Climate models; catchment; climate change; climate effect; global warming; inflow; rainfall-runoff modeling; river basin; river system; water availability; water management; water resource; Australia; Castlereagh Basin; Macquarie Basin; New South Wales",,,,,,"(2007), Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO. .
