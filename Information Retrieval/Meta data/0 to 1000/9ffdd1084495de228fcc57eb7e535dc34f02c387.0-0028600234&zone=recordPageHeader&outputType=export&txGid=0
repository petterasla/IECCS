Using cross-sectional data on climate, farmland prices, and other economic and geophysical data for almost 3000 counties in the US, we find that higher temperatures in all seasons except autumn reduce average farm values, while more precipitation outside of autumn increases farm values. Applying the model to a global-warming scenario shows a significantly lower estimated impact of global warming on US agriculture than the traditional production-function approach and, in one case, suggests that, even without CO2 fertilization, global warming may have economic benefits for agriculture. -Authors",,"agricultural impact; economic effect; global warming; land price; Ricardian analysis; USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00028282,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028600234
