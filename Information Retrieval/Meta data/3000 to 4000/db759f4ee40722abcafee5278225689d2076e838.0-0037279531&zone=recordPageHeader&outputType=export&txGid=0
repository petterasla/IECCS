Thus, the solid material evaporation system was designed to generate flluorocarbon species from solid materials by a CO2 laser evaporation. The electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) O2 plasma equipped with the solid material evaporation system was applied to a-Si and W etching for chamber cleaning process after chemical vapor deposition (CVD). As a result, etching rates using fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) evaporation were about five times as high as those using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) evaporation and etching rates of a-Si and W films were 31 and 27 nm/min, respectively.",,"Amorphous silicon; Carbon dioxide lasers; Chemical vapor deposition; Electron cyclotron resonance; Environmental impact; Evaporation; Fluorocarbons; Greenhouse effect; Polypropylenes; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Solids; Tungsten; Carbon dioxide laser irradiation; Chemical vapor deposition chamber; Environmentally benign etching; Fluorinated ethylene propylene; Green house gas; Plasma etching",,,,,,"Fujita, K., Ito, M., Hori, M., Goto, T., (1999) J.
