Concerns are increasing as native regeneration appears to be decreasing. Preservation of plant species is usually possible through seeds, but success requires knowledge of optimal harvest, storage, and germination requirements. Despite the diligence of a few researchers, this information is still scarce. This review brings together information on native seeds published in the last two decades, building on the previous review published in this journal in 1991. Suggestions for research in the future, in both approach and priorities, are made. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 2007.","Dormancy; Scarification; Seed germination; Stratification; Viability","germination; global warming; land use; literature review; native species; regeneration; research work; Australasia; New Zealand",,,,,,"Allen RB, Partridge TR, Lee WG, Efford M 1992.
