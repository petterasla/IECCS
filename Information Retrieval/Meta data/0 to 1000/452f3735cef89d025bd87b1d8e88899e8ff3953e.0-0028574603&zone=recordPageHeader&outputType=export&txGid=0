Since the downturn in oil prices in the mid 1980's environmental concerns, especially fears of global warming, have replaced oil scarcity as a driving force in support of renewable energy. Decentralized solar photovoltaics (PV), grid-connected windpower, biomass waste-to-energy conversion, and geothermal power appear to have the greatest near-term promise. Issues of human capacity building, access to credit, as well as the active involvement of the commercial sector are basic to progress in these areas. © 1994.","biomass waste-to-energy; fuelwood and charcoal; geothermal power; global warming; Solar photovoltaics; windpower","energy supply; renewable energy; Developing countries; Environmental protection; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse effect; Solar energy; Technology; Wind power; Wood fuels; Decentralized solar photovoltaics; Global warming; Grid connected wind power; Oil price downturn; Trends; Renewable energy resources",,,,,,,"Lovejoy, D.; Unite Nations Department of Development Support, Management Services (DDSMS) New York, 10017, United States",,,,,,,,09601481,,,,"English","Renew.
