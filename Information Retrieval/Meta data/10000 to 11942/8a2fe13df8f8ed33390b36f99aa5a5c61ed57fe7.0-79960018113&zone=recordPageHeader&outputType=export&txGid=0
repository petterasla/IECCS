In a context of climate change, with the expected increase in temperature, dryness and intensity of heat waves, green areas assume even higher importance as they can create a cooling effect that extends to the surrounding areas. This study analyses the thermal performance of a small green space (0.24 ha) and its influence in the surrounding atmospheric environment of a densely urbanised area in Lisbon. Measurements of weather parameters (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar and infrared radiation) were carried out along a selected path, starting from inside the green area to surrounding streets with different orientations and solar exposure. It was found that the garden was cooler than the surrounding areas, either in the sun or in the shade. These differences were higher in hotter days and particularly related to the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt). The highest difference found was of 6.9 °C in relation to air temperature and 39.2 °C in relation to Tmrt; in both cases this difference occurred between the shaded site inside the garden and the sunny site in an E-W oriented street in the southern part of the studied area. Besides the local weather conditions, particularly the low wind speed, the sun exposure and the urban geometry are the potential factors that explain these differences. The cooling effect of green areas on the surrounding environment can be enhanced by additional measures related to the urban features of each city. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Global warming; Green areas; Mitigation; Park cool island; Urban heat island","Air temperature; Atmospheric environment; Cooling effects; Green areas; Green spaces; Heat waves; Local weather conditions; Low wind speed; Mean radiant temperature; Mitigation; Solar exposure; Surrounding environment; Thermal Performance; Urban environments; Urban features; Urban geometry; Urban heat island; Urbanised areas; Weather parameters; Wind speed; Atmospheric humidity; Climatology; Global warming; Infrared radiation; Wind effects; air temperature; cooling; garden; global warming; greenspace; heat island; infrared radiation; relative humidity; solar radiation; urban area; wind velocity; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",,,,,,"Decker, E.H., Elliott, S., Smith, F.A., Blake, D.R., Rowland, F.S., Energy and material flow through the urban ecosystem (2000) Annual Review of Energy and Environment, 25, pp. 685-740; Hough, M., (2004) Cities and Natural Processes: a basis for sustainability, , Routledge, New York; Bridgman, H., Warner, R., Dodson, J., (1995) Urban Biophysical environments, , Oxford University Press; Patz, J.A., Campbell-Lendrum, D., Holloway, T., Foley, J.A., Impact of regional climate change on human health (2005) Nature, 438 (7066), pp. 310-317; (2007) Climate change 2007: impacts, adaptation and Vulnerability.
