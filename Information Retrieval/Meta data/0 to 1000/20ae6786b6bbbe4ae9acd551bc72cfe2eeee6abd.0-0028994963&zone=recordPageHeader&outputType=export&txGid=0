It also appears that as per capita incomes accelerate across countries emissions increases, for the most part, tend to decelerate. It could be that higher income levels lead to increased demand for environmental protection. Only emissions reduction proposals that assure incomes will not be adversely affected, particularly those of less developed countries (LDCs), will have any possibility of successful implementation. © 1995.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Global warming","carbon emission; environmental economics; global perspective",,,,,,"Elkins, The sustainable consumer society (1990) Int.
