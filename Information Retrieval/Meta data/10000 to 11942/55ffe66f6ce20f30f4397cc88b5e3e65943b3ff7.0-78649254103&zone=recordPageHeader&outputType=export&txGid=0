We investigated whether warming altered the balance of CH4 efflux relative to gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) in a freshwater mesocosm experiment. Whole ecosystem CH4 efflux was strongly related to temperature with an apparent activation energy of 0.85eV. Furthermore, CH4 efflux increased faster than ER or GPP with temperature, with all three processes having sequentially lower activation energies. Warming of 4°C increased the fraction of GPP effluxing as CH4 by 20% and the fraction of ER as CH4 by 9%, in line with the offset in their respective activation energies. Because CH4 is 21 times more potent as a greenhouse gas, relative to CO2, these results suggest freshwater ecosystems could drive a previously unknown positive feedback between warming and the carbon cycle. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon cycle; Ecosystem respiration; Global warming; Metabolic theory; Methane; Primary production","activation energy; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; freshwater ecosystem; global warming; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; mesocosm; methane; primary production",,,,,,"Allen, A.P., Gillooly, J.F., Brown, J.H., Linking the global carbon cycle to individual metabolism (2005) Functional Ecology, 19, pp. 202-213; Bales, J.D., Nardi, M.R., (2007), p. 33. , Automated routines for calculating whole-stream metabolism - theoretical background and user's guide: US Geological Survey Techniques and Methods, 4-C2, Available atBartlett, K.B., Harriss, R.C., Nato Advanced Research Workshop on Atmospheric Methane: Sources, Sinks and Role in Global Change (1991), pp. 261-320. , Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd, Mt Hood, OR. -Bastviken, D., Cole, J., Pace, M., Tranvik, L., Methane emissions from lakes (2004) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 18. , dependence of lake characteristics, two regional assessments, and a global estimate., GB4009, doi: DOI: 10.1029/2004GB002238; Benton, T.G., Solan, M., Travis, J.M.J., Sait, S.M., Microcosm experiments can inform global ecological problems (2007) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 22, pp. 516-521; Brown, J.H., Gillooly, J.F., Allen, A.P., Savage, V.M., West, G.B., Toward a metabolic theory of ecology (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 1771-1789; Chanton, J.P., Bauer, J.E., Glaser, P.A., Radiocarbon evidence for the substrates supporting methane formation within northern minnesota peatlands (1995) Geochimica Et Cosmochimica Acta, 59, pp. 3663-3668; Christensen, T.R., Ekberg, A., Strom, L., Factors controlling large scale variations in methane emissions from wetlands (2003) Geophysical Research Letters, 30. , L1414, doi: DOI: 10.1029/2002GL016848; Christensen, T.R., Panikov, N., Mastepanov, M., Biotic controls on CO2 and CH4 exchange in wetlands - a closed environment study (2003) Biogeochemistry, 64, pp. 337-354; Cole, J.J., Caraco, N.F., Atmospheric exchange of carbon dioxide in a low-wind oligotrophic lake measured by the addition of SF6 (1998) Limnology and Oceanography, 43, pp. 647-656; Cole, J.J., Pace, M.L., Carpenter, S.R., Kitchell, J.F., Persistence of net heterotrophy in lakes during nutrient addition and food web manipulations (2000) Limnology and Oceanography, 45, pp. 1718-1730; Conrad, R., Wetter, B., Influence of temperature on energetics of hydrogen metabolism in homoacetogenic, methanogenic and other anaerobic bacteria (1990) Archives of Microbiology, 155, pp. 94-98; Enquist, B.J., Economo, E.P., Huxman, T.E., Allen, A.P., Ignace, D.D., Gillooly, J.F., Scaling metabolism from organisms to ecosystems (2003) Nature, 423, pp. 639-642; Gedney, N., Cox, P.M., Huntingford, C., Climate feedback from wetland methane emissions (2004) Geophysical Research Letters, 31. , L20503, doi: DOI: 10.1029/2004GL020919; Huser, B.A., Wuhrmann, K., Zehnder, A.J.B., Methanothrix soehngenii gen-nov-spp-nov, a new acetotrophic non-hydrogen oxidizing methane bacterium (1982) Archives of Microbiology, 132, pp. 1-9; Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) Climate change 2007, pp. 7-22. , IPCC the physical sciences basis.
