Waterborne disease agents, such as Giardia cysts and Cryposporidium oocysts have been positively correlated with rainfall. El Niño-related extreme weather conditions can have a significant impact on vector- and water-borne diseases. The linkages between weather, terrestrial ecology and human health have been discovered for some diseases, such as rodentborne hantavirus. Marine ecology also plays a role in determining human health risks, such as from cholera, and other enteric pathogens. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, and water control systems singly, and in combination have been accompanied by increases in or emergence of diseases like malaria and schistosomiasis in some regions of the world. Long-term climate change may increase the frequency of heat waves and potentially air pollution episodes, increase the number of extreme weather events, cause coastal flooding and salination of fresh water aquifers, and displace coastal settlements. Ultimately, a two-pronged approach (empirical and modeling studies) is required to better understand these linkages between climatological and ecological change as determinants of disease. © 2001 by ASP.","Air pollution; Deforestation; El Niño; Global warming; Malaria; Waterborne disease",,,,,,,"Atherholt, T.B., LeChevallier, M.W., Norton, W.D., Effect of rainfall on giardia and crypto (1998) J Am Water Works Assoc, 90 (9), pp. 66-80; Bouma, M.J., Poveda, G., Rojas, W., Predicting high-risk years for malaria in Colombia using parameters of El Nino Southern Oscillation (1997) Trop Med Int Health, 2 (12), pp. 1122-1127; Outbreak of acute febrile illness and pulmonary hemorrhage-Nicaragua, 1995 (1995) JAMA, 274, p. 1668; Coluzzi, M., Sabatini, A., Petrarca, V., Chromosomal differentiation and adaptation to human environments in the Anopheles gambiae complex (1979) Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 73 (5), p. 483497; Colwell, R.R., Global climate and infectious disease: The cholera paradigm (1996) Science, 274, pp. 2025-2031; Colwell, R.R., Patz, J.A., (1998) Climate, Infectious Disease and Health: An Interdisciplinary Perspective, , American Academy of Microbiology, Washington, DC, USA; Curriero, F.C., Patz, J.A., Rose, J.B., Analysis of the association between extreme precipitation and waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States, 1948-1994 (2001) Am J Public Health (Aug), 91, pp. 1194-1199; Downs, W.G., Pittendrigh, C.S., Bromeliade malaria in Trinidad, British West Indies (1946) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 26, pp. 47-66; Engelthaler, D.M., Mosley, D.G., Cheek, J.E., Climatic and environmental patterns associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Four Corners region, United States (1999) Emerg Infect Dis, 5 (1), pp. 87-94; Glass, G.E., Cheek, J., Patz, J.A., Using remotely sensed data to identify areas at risk for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (2000) J Emerg Infect Dis, 6 (3), pp. 238-246; Hales, S., Kovats, S., Woodward, A., What El Niño can tell us about human health and global climate change (2000) Global Change and Human Health, 1 (1), pp. 66-77; Hallegraeff, G.M., A review of harmful algal blooms and their apparent global increase (1993) Phycologia, 32 (2), pp. 79-99; Jobin, W., (1999) Ecological Design and Health Impacts of Large Dams, Canals, and Irrigation Systems, , E and FN Spon, London, UK; Kalkstein, L.S., Greene, J.S., An evaluation of climate/mortality relationships in large U.S. cities and possible impacts of a climate change (1997) Environ Health Perspect, 105 (1), pp. 2-11; Kaplan, J.E., Larrick, J.W., Yost, J., Infectious disease patterns in the Waorani, an isolated Amerindian population (1980) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 29 (2), pp. 298-312; Kilian, A.H.D., Langi, P., Talisuna, A., Rainfall pattern, El Nino and malaria in Uganda (1999) Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 93, p. 2223; Kirk-Davidoff, D.B., Hintsa, E.J., Anderson, N.G., The effect of climate change on ozone depletion through changes in stratospheric water vapour (1999) Nature, 402, pp. 399-401; Ko, A.I., Galvao Reis, M., Ribeiro Dourado, C.M., Urban epidemic of severe leptospiro-sis in Brazil (1999) Lancet, 354 (9181), pp. 820-825. , Salvador Leptospirosis Study Group; Koren, H.S., Bromberg, P.A., Respiratory responses of asthmatics to ozone (1995) Int Arch Allergy Immunol, 107 (1-3), pp. 236-238; Koren, H.S., Utell, M.J., Asthma and the environment (1997) Environ Health Perspect, 105 (5), pp. 534-537","Patz, J.A.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 615 N.
