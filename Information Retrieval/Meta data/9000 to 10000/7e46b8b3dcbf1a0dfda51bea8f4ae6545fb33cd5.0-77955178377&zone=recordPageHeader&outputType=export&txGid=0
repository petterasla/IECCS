Automobile petrol demand has been of particular interest to researchers and policy-makers, given that the automobile is a major contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect. This paper forecasts Australia's automobile petrol demand up to the year 2020 based on the best performing forecasting model selected out of eight models. In order to establish ways to reduce the demand for petrol, and the consequent by-product of reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, we have estimated the impact on CO2 for several potential policy instruments, using Transportation and Environment Strategy Impact Simulator (an integrated transport, land use and environmental strategy impact simulation programme). We find that a carbon tax of AU$0.50/kg can reduce automobile kilometres by 5.9%, resulting in reduced demand for petrol and a reduction in CO2 of 1.5%. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.","CO2; Environmental policies; Forecasting models; Greenhouse gas emissions; Passenger cars; Petrol demand; TRESIS","A-carbon; Australia; Environmental policies; Environmental policy; Environmental strategy; Forecasting models; Impact simulation; Integrated transport; Policy instruments; Policy makers; Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Environmental management; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Fuel consumption; Gasoline; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Passenger cars; Transportation; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; environmental policy; forecasting method; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; policy making; pollution tax; transportation economics; Australia",,,,,,"(2001) Survey of Motor Vehicle Use, , ABS, Australia, Oct. 2000.
