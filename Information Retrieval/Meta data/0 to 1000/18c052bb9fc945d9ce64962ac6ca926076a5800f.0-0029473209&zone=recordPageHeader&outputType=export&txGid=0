We re-evaluate the effect of the cool thermal skin and present a high-resolution seasonal estimate of its effect on the air-sea flux of CO2. We compare air-sea flux estimates derived using both a mean wind field and a more realistic Rayleigh distribution of the wind field. Using the mean monthly wind stress and a linear relationship between wind speed and the gas exchange coefficient of CO2 (Tans et al., 1990), we estimate that excluding the southern ocean, the surface skin correction increases the air-sea flux of carbon by 0.48 Gt yr-1. -Authors",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; air-sea flux; air/sea flux; carbon dioxide; sea surface temperature; SST; thermal skin; thermal skin effect; gas exchange; sea; sea surface temperature; skin; skin surface; solubility; velocity",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,,,,,,,,,,08866236,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029473209
