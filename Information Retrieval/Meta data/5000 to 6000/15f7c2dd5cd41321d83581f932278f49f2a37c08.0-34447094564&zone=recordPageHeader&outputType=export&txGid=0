A nation can mitigate by reducing CO2 emissions, which reduces the probability of a catastrophic event; it can adapt by altering the infrastructure so that damages can be reduced in the event a catastrophe is realized. Herein we add to the current literature by extending the endogenous risk framework into a dynamic framework permitting analysis of both mitigation and adaptation while allowing for the dynamic process of global climate change. Our results suggest adaptation to catastrophe is a small fraction of the national climate protection budget relative to mitigation when nations cooperate fully, when damages are both continuous and catastrophic, and when nations have a short planning horizon. Adaptation becomes more important relative to mitigation when nations are unlikely to cooperate, when damages are mainly catastrophic, or when the nation's planning horizon increases. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; International cooperation; Planning; Probability; Risk management; Catastrophic events; Catastrophic risks; Dynamic process; Climate change; adaptation; catastrophic event; climate; climate change; global climate; mitigation; risk assessment",,,,,,"Hammitt, J.K., Adams, J.L., The value of international cooperation for abating global climate change (1996) Resour Energy Econ, 18, pp. 219-241; Hanley, N., Shogren, J.F., White, B., (2006) Environmental Economics: In Theory and Practice, , 2 Palgrave London; Kane, S., Shogren, J., Linking adaptation and mitigation in climate change policy (2000) Clim Change, 45, pp. 75-102. , 1; Nordhaus, W.D., An optimal transition path for controlling greenhouse gases (1992) Science, 258, pp. 1315-1319; Nordhaus, W.D., Expert opinion on climate change (1994) Am Sci, 82, pp. 45-51; Nordhaus, W.D., Climate Allowances Protocol (CAP): Comparison of alternative global tradable emissions regimes (1997) NBER/Yale Workshop on International Environmental Economics, , Paper presented to the, Snowmass, Colorado, June 17, 1997; Nordhaus, W.D., Yang, Z., A regional dynamic general-equilibrium model of alternative climate-change strategies (1996) Am Econ Rev, pp. 741-764; Peck, S.C., Teisberg, T.J., International CO2 emissions control: An analysis using CETA.
