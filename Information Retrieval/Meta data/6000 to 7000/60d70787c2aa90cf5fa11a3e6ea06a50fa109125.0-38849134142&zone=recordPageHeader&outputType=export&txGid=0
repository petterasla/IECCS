We modeled the effects of elevational limits on the extinction risk of landbirds, 87% of all bird species. Elevational limitation of range size explained 97% of the variation in the probability of being in a World Conservation Union category of extinction risk. Our model that combined elevational ranges, four Millennium Assessment habitat-loss scenarios, and an intermediate estimate of surface warming of 2.8° C, projected a best guess of 400-550 landbird extinctions, and that approximately 2150 additional species would be at risk of extinction by 2100. For Western Hemisphere landbirds, intermediate extinction estimates based on climate-induced changes in actual distributions ranged from 1.3% (1.1° C warming) to 30.0% (6.4° C warming) of these species. Worldwide, every degree of warming projected a nonlinear increase in bird extinctions of about 100-500 species. Only 21% of the species predicted to become extinct in our scenarios are currently considered threatened with extinction. Different habitat-loss and surface-warming scenarios predicted substantially different futures for landbird species. To improve the precision of climate-induced extinction estimates, there is an urgent need for high-resolution measurements of shifts in the elevational ranges of species. Given the accelerating influence of climate change on species distributions and conservation, using elevational limits in a tested, standardized, and robust manner can improve conservation assessments of terrestrial species and will help identify species that are most vulnerable to global climate change. Our climate-induced extinction estimates are broadly similar to those of bird species at risk from other factors, but these estimates largely involve different sets of species. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Avian biogeography; Biodiversity; Extinction likelihood; GIS; Global warming; Lapse rates; Macroecology; Mountain endemics; Ornithology; Tropical forests","biodiversity; climate change; extinction risk; GIS; global warming; habitat loss; macroecology; modeling; ornithology; tropical forest; altitude; animal; article; biological model; bird; demography; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; physiology; species extinction; Altitude; Animals; Birds; Demography; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Biological; Aves",,,,,,"Benning, T.L., Lapointe, D., Atkinson, C.T., Vitousek, P.M., Interactions of climate change with biological invasions and land use in the Hawaiian Islands: Modeling the fate of endemic birds using a geographic information system (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99, pp. 14246-14249. , and; (2000) Threatened Birds of the World., , BirdLife International.
