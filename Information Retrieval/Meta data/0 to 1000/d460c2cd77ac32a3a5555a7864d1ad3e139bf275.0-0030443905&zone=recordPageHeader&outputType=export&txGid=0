Box 18, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Many cultivated crop plants of temperate and cool temperate zones haveduring their domestication been transferred far from their original habitatsand been distributed over a wide range of climates. In general crop plantsseem to possess potential to climatic adaptation. Processes in the past havetaken hundreds or thousands of years and over large number of generations.The concern on the velocity of the expected global warming and of subsequentchanges in other factors justifies planning of breeding for global warming.Perennial plants, forest trees in particular are more at the focal point thanannual plants. Most agricultural annuals may be replaced any year withanother cultivar or species better adapted to contemporary circumstances.Trees need tens of years to reach commercial dimensions or fructiferous age.Capriciousness is the main problem of climate change. Large variation oftemperature, precipitation among years actually masks the gradual change ofaverage values. The amplitude of variation among years exceeds the predictedaverage change. Thus, plasticity of individuals besides within populationvariation in adaptive traits is a comer stone of breeding plans. From theecological point of view two factors are significant: 1. mild winters mayinterfere dormancy release and frost tolerance, and also alter host-parasiterelationships. 2. The timing of thermal seasons will change in relation tophotoperiod. This phenomenon is most prominent in the far north, where therelative warming is largest and the photoperiodic pattern steepest. Eventhough perennial plants display potential of acclimatization, selection andbreeding are eligible measures to improve productivity. As long as themagnitude and velocity of the global warming remain uncertain, it isimpossible to set specified aims to breeding. The only reasonable method isto run parallelly several lines with differing patterns of adaptive traits.Multiple population breeding system (MPBS) seems to be tailored to thispurpose.","acclimatization; adaptation; annualrhythm; diversity; photoperiod; tem perature",,,,,,,"Beuker, E., Long-term effects of temperature on the wood production of Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.)
