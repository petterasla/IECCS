Without changing any dehumidifier components, experimental results demonstrate that superior performance characteristics can be achieved with 67.5 g of HC refrigerant, which is only 50% of the original mass of the R-134a refrigerant. Generally, the refrigerant in domestic dehumidifiers can be changed from R-134a to a R-600a/R-290 refrigerant mixture, and the ozone depletion potential and global warming potential are negligible when compared with those of the R-134a refrigerant.
