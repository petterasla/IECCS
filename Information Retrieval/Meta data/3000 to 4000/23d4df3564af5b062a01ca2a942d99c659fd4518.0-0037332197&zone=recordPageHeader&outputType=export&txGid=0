This study finds that global population change over the last two decades is more than proportionally associated with growth in carbon dioxide emissions, and that the impact of population change on emissions is much more pronounced in developing countries than in developed countries. The empirical findings are based on a data for 93 countries over the period 1975-1996. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
