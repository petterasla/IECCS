Such frameworks should be subjected to critical review to determine if they meet crucial expectations. In the case of the US Global Change Research Program, we perceive that most research follows a framework that we define as the predictive model framework. We believe this framework is insufficient for resolving the unprecedented predicaments posed by global change. We recommend a complementary framework, the system response framework, which directs research toward useful indicators of change rather than precise predictions. We further argue that, even if research is complementary and effective under the two frameworks, conclusive results prior to decisions should not be expected. The burden of proof must itself be a continuing topic of open discourse and inquiry. © 1994 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Climate change; Decisions; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Indicators; Interdisciplinary; Research","ecology; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; global climate; greenhouse effect; policy; research; risk assessment; short survey; society; technology; climate change; ecological indicator; Global Change Research Programme; USA",,,,,,"Ausubel, J.H., A second look at the impacts of climate change (1991) American Scientist, 79, pp. 210-221; Bella, D., (1992) Research and the future of the technosphere, , Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon; Bella, D.A., Overton, W.S., Environmental planning and ecological possibilities (1972) Journal of Sanitary Engineering Division, American Society of Civil Engineering, 3 SA, pp. 579-592; Bella, D., Li, H., Jacobs, R., (1992) Ecological indicators of global climate change: Proceedings of a US Fish and Wildlife Service Workshop, 13–15 November 1990, , Oregon State University, Corvallis; Bohr, N., (1934) Atomic theory and the description of nature, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bohr, N., On the notions of causality and complementarity (1950) Science, 3, pp. 51-54; Broecker, W.A., Peteet, D.M., Rind, D., Does the ocean-atmosphere system have more than one stable mode of operation?
