The optimal date of sowing was also evaluated in view of the increase in seasonal temperature. The yield of these crops, especially wheat, already showing signs of stagnation in most places of northwest India, is most likely to be affected by temperature changes. The solar radiation-temperature interactions study in wheat reveals some interesting trends and is seen to vary from one location to another. Keeping in view the trends in global climate change, a shift in sowing time, as an adaptation strategy is recommended. The simple and empirical relations between yield and seasonal temperature change can be well used for a crude estimate of yield dependence of temperature rise of these winter crops.","Radiation; Simulation; Sowing time; Temperature change; Winter crops; Yield","Brassica; Cicer arietinum; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Das, D.K., Kalra, N., Adjustments to weather variation through cropping systems and fertilizer use (1995) Fert.
