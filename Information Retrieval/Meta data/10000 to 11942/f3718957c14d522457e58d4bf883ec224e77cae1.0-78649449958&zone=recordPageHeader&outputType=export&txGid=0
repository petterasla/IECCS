From the viewpoint of building physics, the main problem concerning subtropical climate is the high level of humidity in combination with high temperature. In this study, a flexible building envelope consisting of wood and clay components was developed so that the materials and the assemblies can be easily tailored to comply with local climatic conditions. The movement and accumulation of moisture in the wall was of prime concern. This has been investigated by means of testing full scale walls in a climate chamber and the corresponding one dimensional transient heat and transfer simulation. In order to achieve a consistency between calculation and measurement, the individual materials were tested for their hygric and thermal properties. Based on these findings attempts were made to calculate the behavior of an optimized wall assembly under real climatic conditions of central Japan. As a result, it was shown that the hygrothermal behavior of the envelope is predictable by means of the models and the simulation program used, and that no risk of interstitial condensation and mold growth was predicted under the real climatic conditions of Kyoto. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Clay and wood mixture; Climate chamber; Diffusion open; Japanese climate; Sustainable building envelope; Wood fiber insulation","Climate chambers; Japanese climate; Sustainable building; Wood fiber insulation; Wood mixtures; Computer simulation; Global warming; Intelligent buildings; Solar buildings; Sustainable development; Thermodynamic properties; Wood products; Tropics; climate conditions; climate effect; computer simulation; construction material; heat transfer; insulation; subtropical region; urban climate; Buildings; Insulation; Simulation; Thermal Properties; Tropics; Wood Fibers; Wood Products; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Kyoto",,,,,,"(1999) CIB.
