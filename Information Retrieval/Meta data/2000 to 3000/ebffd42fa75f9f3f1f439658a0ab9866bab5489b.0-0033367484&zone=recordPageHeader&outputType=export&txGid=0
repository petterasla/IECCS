The U.S. Senate voted unanimously to oppose any agreement that does not require emissions reductions in low-income countries. The ethics of this position are examined in this paper which shows that there are good moral reasons for supporting the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol. Such a conclusion follows easily from considerations of distributive justice but can also be supported by more narrowly self-interested arguments.","Development; Distributive justice; Ethics; Global warming; U.S. politics","ethics; global warming; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; North-South relations",,,,,,"Audi, R., (1997) Moral Knowledge and Ethical Character, , Oxford University Press, New York; Audi, R., Outline of a Kantian Intuitionism in Moral Epistemology and Normative Ethics (1998) Moral Theory and Its Practical Application: An Interdisciplinary Seminar, , notes from the seminar entitled University of Nebraska, Lincoln June 8-13; Baier, A., The Rights of Past and Future Persons (1981) Responsibilities to Future Generations, , Ernest Partridge (ed), Prometheus Books, Buffalo, NY; Banuri, T., Göran-Mäler, K., Grubb, M., Jacobson, H.K., Yamin, F., Equity and Social Considerations (1996) Climate Change 1995: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change, , James P.
