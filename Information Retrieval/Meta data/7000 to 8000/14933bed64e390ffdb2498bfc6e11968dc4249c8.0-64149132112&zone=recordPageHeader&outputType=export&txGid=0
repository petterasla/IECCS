These are »weighed« indicators: the individual emissions or discharges of components contributing to a certain theme are multiplied with a weighing factor and aggregated. Eco-efficiency indicators are calculated by dividing the »weighed« indicators by a value related to production. These relative indicators make it possible to quantify the evolution of the environmental performance for a process, company or industrial site and to evaluate which component(s) contribute(s) most to a given theme, thus allowing to set priorities for lowering the environmental impact. Examples illustrate the proposed method. Attention is also given to the emission of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) during the incineration of waste, trying to answer the question: are waste incinerators sinks or sources of POPs? It is shown that for non-carcinogenic effects of POPs, according to the incineration scenario, the weighed input/output ranges from 0.3 to 20,500 when considering the POPs in flue gases and solid residues.","Company; Eco-efficiency; Environmental performance or impact indicator; Footprint; Industrial site; POPs; Process; Region; Waste incinerator","acidification; article; ecotoxicity; environmental health; environmental impact; eutrophication; flue gas; fluid intake; greenhouse effect; incineration; industrial area; industrial production; industrialization; occupational toxicology; ozone depletion; photochemical efficiency; pollutant; pollution; quantitative analysis; waste management",,,,,,"(2000) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, , http://www.globalreporting.org, Global Reporting Initiative GRI; AZAPAGIC, A., PERDAN, S., Indicators of Sustainable Development for Industry (2000) Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 78 (B4), pp. 243-261; THORESEN, J., Environmental performance evaluation-a tool for industrial improvement (1999) Journal of Cleaner Production, 7, pp. 365-370; Vereniging van de Nederlandse Chemische Industrie (VNCI) 2006 Environmental Performance Indicators for the Chemical Industry; the EPI method, (http://www.vnci.nl)SCHWARZ, J., BELOFF, B., BEAVER, E., (2002) Use sustainability metrics to guide decision-making, pp. 58-63. , www.cepmagazine.org; BLOCK, C., VAN GERVEN, T., Industry and energy sectors in Flanders: Environmental perfoemance and response indicators (2007) Clean Techn Environ Policy, 9, pp. 43-51; HOUGHTON, J.T., DING, X., GRIGGS, D.J., NOGUER, M., VAN DER LINDEN, P.J., DAI, X., MASKELL, K., JOHNSON, C.A., Climate change 2001 - The Scientific Basis (2001) Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report, , of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
