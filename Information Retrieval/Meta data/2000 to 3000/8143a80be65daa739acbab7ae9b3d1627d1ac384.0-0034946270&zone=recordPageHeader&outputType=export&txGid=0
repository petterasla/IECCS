To a great extent, all these factors are negligible in the case of a 200-m-deep borehole located near the town of Evora, in southern Portugal. This allows confidence in the interpretation of the borehole temperature versus depth (T-z) profile in terms of the GST changes during the last 150-200 years. To obtain estimates of the GST history, the functional space inversion method was used, which allows incorporation of uncertainties in the data as a priori standard deviations. The method yielded a GST history that indicates warming of about 1 K since the second half of the last century to the middle of the 1990s, with an increase in the last 10-15 years. The results agree with the surface air temperatures (SAT) recorded at the Lisbon meteorological station since 1856, which display a warming trend with an amplitude of about 1 K for the same period. The reduced temperature of the studied T-z profile was used to extend the observed SAT series to times before the instrumental period by estimating the long-term pre-observational mean (POM). The shape of the reduced temperature curve is best fit by POM values that are a few 10ths of a degree Celsius higher than 15.6°C, which is the mean of the SAT series in the period 1856-1900. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Borehole temperatures; Global warming; Portugal; Recent climate","borehole; climate change; surface temperature; Portugal",,,,,,"Beltrami, H., Mareschal, J.-C., Ground temperature histories for central and eastern Canada from geothermal measurements: Little ice age signature (1992) Geophys.
