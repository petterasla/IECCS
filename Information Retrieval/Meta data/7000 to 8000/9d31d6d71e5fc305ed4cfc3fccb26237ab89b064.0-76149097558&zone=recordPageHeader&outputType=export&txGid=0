We present a simple conceptual model of anthropogenic CO2 emissions to highlight the trade off between delay in commencing mitigation, and the strength of mitigation then required to meet specific atmospheric CO2 stabilization targets. We calculate the effects of alternative emission profiles on atmospheric CO2 and global temperature change over a millennial timescale using a simple coupled carbon cycle-climate model. For example, if it takes 50 years to transform the energy sector and the maximum rate at which emissions can be reduced is -2.5% year-1, delaying action until 2020 would lead to stabilization at 540 ppm. A further 20 year delay would result in a stabilization level of 730 ppm, and a delay until 2060 would mean stabilising at over 1,000 ppm. If stabilization targets are met through delayed action, combined with strong rates of mitigation, the emissions profiles result in transient peaks of atmospheric CO2 (and potentially temperature) that exceed the stabilization targets. Stabilization at 450 ppm requires maximum mitigation rates of -3% to -5% year-1, and when delay exceeds 2020, transient peaks in excess of 550 ppm occur. Consequently tipping points for certain Earth system components may be transgressed. Avoiding dangerous climate change is more easily achievable if global mitigation action commences as soon as possible. Starting mitigation earlier is also more effective than acting more aggressively once mitigation has begun. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.",,"Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric CO; Carbon cycles; Climate change mitigation; Climate model; Conceptual model; Earth systems; Emission profile; Energy sector; Global temperature change; Stabilization target; Time-scales; Tipping point; Trade off; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Stabilization; Targets; Climate models; action plan; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; global warming; human activity; mitigation; temperature effect; trade-off",,,,,,"Achard, F., Eva, H.D., Stibig, H.-J., Mayaux, P., Gallego, J., Richards, T., Malingreau, J.-P., Determination of deforestation rates of the world's humid tropical forests (2002) Science, 297, pp. 999-1002; (2007) Statistical Review of World Energy., , BP, London: BP plc; Broecker, W.S., CO2 arithmetic (2007) Science, 315, p. 1371; Defries, R.S., Houghton, R.A., Hansen, M.C., Field, C.B., Skole, D., Townshend, J., Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation and regrowth based on satellite observations for the 1980s and 1990s (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 99, pp. 14256-14261; den Elzen, M.G.J., van Vuuren, D.P., Peaking profiles for achieving long-term temperature targets with more likelihood at lower costs (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 104, pp. 17931-17936; den Elzen, M., Meinshausen, M., van Vuuren, D., Multi-gas emission envelopes to meet greenhouse gas concentration targets: Costs versus certainty of limiting temperature increase (2007) Glob Environ Change, 17, pp. 260-280; (2006) International Energy Outlook 2006, , EIA, Washington, DC: Energy Information Administration, US Department of Energy; (2005) Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005: Progress Towards Sustainable Forest Management., , FAO, Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; Friedlingstein, P., Cox, P., Betts, R., Bopp, L., von Bloh, W., Brovkin, V., Cadule, P., Zeng, N., Climate-carbon cycle feedback analysis: Results from C4MIP model intercomparison (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 3337-3353; Hansen, J., Sato, M., Kharecha, P., Russell, G., Lea, D.W., Siddall, M., Climate change and trace gases (2007) Phil Trans R Soc A, 365, pp. 1925-1954; Hasselmann, K., Latif, M., Hooss, G., Azar, C., Edenhofer, O., Jaeger, C.C., Johannessen, O.M., Wokaun, A., The challenge of long-term climate change (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1923-1925; Houghton, R.A., Revised estimates of the annual net flux of carbon to the atmosphere from changes in land use and land management 1850-2000 (2003) Tellus, 55 B, pp. 378-390; Houghton, R.A., Hackler, J.L., (2002) Carbon Flux to the Atmosphere from Land-Use Changes.
