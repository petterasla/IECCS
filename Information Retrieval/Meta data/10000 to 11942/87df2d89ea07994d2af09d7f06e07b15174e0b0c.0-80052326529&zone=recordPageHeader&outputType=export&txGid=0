An important method of investigating GHG emissions in agricultural ecosystems is model simulation. Field measurements quantifying N 2O and CO 2 fluxes were taken in a summer maize ecosystem in Zhangye City, Gansu Province, in northwestern China in 2010. Observed N 2O and CO 2 fluxes were used for validating flux predictions by a DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model. Then sensitivity tests on the validated DNDC model were carried out on three variables: climatic factors, soil properties and agricultural management. Results indicated that: (1) the factors that N 2O emissions were sensitive to included nitrogen fertilizer application rate, manure amendment and residue return rate; (2) CO 2 emission increased with increasing manure amendment, residue return rate and initial soil organic carbon (SOC); and (3) net global warming potential (GWP) increased with increasing N fertilizer application rate and decreased with manure amendment, residue return rate and precipitation increase. Simulation of the long-term impact on SOC, N 2O and net GWP emissions over 100 yr of management led to the conclusion that increasing residue return rate is a more efficient method of mitigating GHG emission than increasing fertilizer N application rate in the study area. © Author(s) 2011.",,"agricultural emission; agricultural management; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition; denitrification; environmental factor; fertilizer application; field method; flux measurement; global warming; greenhouse gas; maize; management practice; nitrous oxide; numerical model; oasis; pollutant source; precipitation (climatology); sensitivity analysis; soil amendment; soil organic matter; soil property; China; Gansu; Zhangye; Zea mays",,,,,,"Addiscott, T.M., Whitmore, A.P., Computer simulation of changes in soil mineral nitrogen and crop nitrogen during autumn, winter and spring (1987) J.
