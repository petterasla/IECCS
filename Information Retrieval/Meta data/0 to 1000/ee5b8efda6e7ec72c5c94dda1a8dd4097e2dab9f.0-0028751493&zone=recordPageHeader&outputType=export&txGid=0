Japan successfully overcame two energy crisis in the 1970s despite the fragile nature of its energy structure and was able to maintain economic growth, resulting in a dramatic improvement in its industrial technology as a whole. Noteworthy is that such efforts were successful because they included such means as substituting an unconstrained production factor (technology) for a constrained production factor (energy) in a manner similar to an ecosystem. Given the two-directional nature of CO2 discharge and energy consumption, the experience of Japan can provide informative suggestions in response to current worldwide concerns regarding global warming due to CO2 discharge. However, Japan may now face the prospect of energy and environmental constraints again following the fall of international oil prices. In response, MITI established the New Sunshine Program (R&amp;D program on Energy and Environmental Technologies) by integrating related R&amp;D programs. A PV power generation system is one of the priority projects in the Program.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Operations research; Power generation; Productivity; Carbon dioxide discharge; Energy and environmental constraints; Energy crisis; Photovoltaic power generation system; Photovoltaic cells",,,,,,,"Toma, Kenichi; Inst of Applied Energy, Tokyo, Japan",,,"Mita Press, Tokyo, Japan",,,,,09125434,,ODTEE,,"English","Optoelectron Devices Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028751493
