There, winter conditions are subject to rapid climate change. The potential loss of a longer-lasting snow cover with implications to other plantrelated climate parameters and overwintering strategies make the temperate zone particularly vulnerable to winter climate change. A formalized literature search in the ISI Web of Science shows that plant related research on the effects of winter climate change is generally underrepresented. Temperate regions in particular are rarely studied in this respect, although the few existing studies imply strong effects of winter climate change on species ranges, species compositions, phenology, or frost injury. The generally positive effect of warming on plant survival and production may be counteracted by effects such as an increased frost injury of roots and shoots, an increased insect pest risk, or a disrupted synchrony between plants and pollinators. Based on the literature study, gaps in current knowledge are discussed. Understanding the relative effects of interacting climate parameters, as well as a stronger consideration of shortterm events and variability of climatic conditions is urgent. With respect to plant response, it would be particularly worthwhile to account for hidden players such as pathogens, pollinators, herbivores, or fungal partners in mycorrhization. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate change; Frost; Global warming; Snow; Temperate zone; Winter ecology","snow; soil; biological production; climate change; ecosystem function; frost; mycorrhiza; overwintering; plant; plant-pollinator interaction; snow cover; survival; synchrony; temperate environment; vegetation dynamics; vulnerability; article; climate; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; plant; season; soil; temperature; plant development; Climate; Ecosystem; Plants; Seasons; Snow; Soil; Temperature; Hexapoda; Climate; Ecosystem; Plant Development; Seasons; Snow; Soil; Temperature",,"Soil; Soil",,,,"Andresen, L.C., Michelsen, A., Off-season uptake of nitrogen in temperate heath vegetation (2005) Oecologia, 144, pp. 585-597; Banuelos, M.J., Kollmann, J., Hartvig, P., Quevedo, M., Modelling the distribution of Ilex aquifolium at the north-eastern edge of its geographical range (2004) Nordic Journal of Botany, 23, pp. 129-142; Bates, J.W., Thompson, K., Grime, J.P., Effects of simulated long-term climatic change on the bryophytes of a limestone grassland community (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 757-769; Berger, S., Soehlke, G., Walther, G.-R., Pott, R., Bioclimatic limits and range shifts of cold-hardy evergreen broad-leaved species at their northern distributional limit in Europe (2007) Phytocoenologia, 37, pp. 523-539; Bilbrough, C.J., Welker, J.M., Bowman, W.D., Early spring nitrogen uptake by snow-covered plants: A comparison of arctic and alpine plant function under the snowpack (2000) Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, 32, pp. 404-411; Box, E.O., Crumpacker, D.W., Hardin, E.D., A. climatic model for location of plant species in Florida, USA (1993) Journal of Biogeography, 20, pp. 629-644; Brown, J., Ferrians Jr., O.J., Heginbottom, J.A., Melnikov, E.S., (1998) Circum-Arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground-ice Conditions, , National Snow and Ice Data Center/World Data Center for Glaciology, Digital Media, Boulder, Colorado, USA, Revised February 2001; Cleavitt, N.L., Fahey, T.J., Groffman, P.M., Hardy, J.P., Henry, K.S., Driscoll, C.T., Effects of soil freezing on fine roots in a northern hardwood forest (2008) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 38, pp. 82-91; Crumpacker, D.W., Box, E.O., Hardin, E.D., Implications of climatic warming for conservation of native trees and shrubs in Florida (2001) Conservation Biology, 15, pp. 1008-1020; Darrow, H.E., Bannister, P., Burritt, D.J., Jameson, P.E., The frost resistance of juvenile and adult forms of some heteroblastic New Zealand plants (2001) New Zealand Journal of Botany, 39, pp. 355-363; Dewar, R.C., Watt, A.D., Predicted changes in the synchrony of larval emergence and budburst under climatic warming (1992) Oecologia, 89, pp. 557-559; Felton, A.J., Climate change, conservation and management: An assessment of the peer-reviewed scientific journal literature (2009) Biodiversity and Conservation, 18, pp. 2243-2253; Fox, L.R., Ribeiro, S.P., Brown, V.K., Masters, G.J., Clarke, I.P., Direct and indirect effects of climate change on St John's wort, Hypericum perforatum L.
