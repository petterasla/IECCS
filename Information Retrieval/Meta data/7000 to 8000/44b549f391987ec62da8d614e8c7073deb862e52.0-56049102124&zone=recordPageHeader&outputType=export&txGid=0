Regression is often used to estimate forest variables (including carbon) using satellite sensor data though a low coefficient of determination (R2) is apparent and this research was designed to investigate both traditional and alternate regression approaches to increase the magnitude of R2. The study area was located in southeastern Bangladesh. Data from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and ground-based forest survey were used. This research explored the use of dummy variables in regression models to increase R2, while the dummies were set from the optimal stratification of forestland. The finding will heighten the accuracy of forest attribute estimation and help to understand terrestrial carbon dynamics and global climate change.",,"Carbon; Climate control; Climatology; Regression analysis; Bangladesh; Carbon dynamics; Carbon emissions; Coefficient of determinations; Dummy variables; Forest carbons; Forest covers; Global climate changes; Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plusses; Periodic monitoring; Regression models; Satellite sensor datums; Study areas; Climate change; carbon cycle; carbon emission; climate change; estimation method; forest cover; Landsat thematic mapper; numerical model; regression analysis; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; Asia; Bangladesh; Eurasia; South Asia",,,,,,"Alchrona, E., (1988) The Impact of Climate and Man on Land Transformation in Central Sudan, Meddelande Fran Lunds Universitets Geografiska Institutioner, , Lund University Press, Lund; Ardo, J., Volume quantification of coniferous forest compartments using spectral radiance recorded by Landsat Thematic Mapper (1992) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 13, pp. 1779-1786; Baten, S.A., (1969) Revised Working Plan for the Forests of the Chittagong Division for the Period from 1968-69 to 1977-78, , Forest Department, Government of East Pakistan, Dhaka; Brown, S., Gillespie, A.J.R., Lugo, A.E., Biomass estimation methods for tropical forest with applications to forest inventory data (1989) Forest Science, 35, pp. 881-902; Champion, H.G., Seth, S.K., Khattak, G.M., (1965) Forest Types of Pakistan, , Pakistan Forest Institute, Peshawar; Chavez Jr., P.S., Image-based atmospheric corrections-revisited and revised (1996) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 62, pp. 1025-1036; Cochran, W.G., (1977) Sampling Techniques, , Wiley, New York; Draper, N.R., Smith, H., (1998) Applied Regression Analysis, , Wiley, New York; (1997) Estimating Biomass and Biomass Change of Tropical Forests: A Primer, , FAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome; (2005) Global Forest Resource Assessment 2005, , FAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome; Foody, G.M., Boyd, D.S., Cutler, M.W.J., Predictive relations of tropical forest biomass from Landsat TM data and their transferability between regions (2003) Remote Sensing of Environment, 85, pp. 463-474; (1966) Chittagong Hill Tracts Soil and Landuse Survey 1964-1966, , FORESTAL Forestry and Engineering International Limited, Vancouver; Franco-Lopez, H., Ek, A.R., Bauer, M.E., Estimation and mapping of forest stand density, volume and cover type using the k-nearest neighbors method (2001) Remote Sensing of Environment, 77, pp. 251-274; Franklin, J., Thematic mapper analysis of coniferous forest structure and composition (1986) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 7, pp. 1287-1301; Franklin, J., Logan, T.L., Woodcock, C.E., Strahler, A.H., Coniferous forest classification and inventory using Landsat and digital terrain data (1986) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 24, pp. 139-149; Gjertsen, A.K., Two-phase sampling for forest inventory based on satellite imagery (1996) Proceedings of the 15th EARSeL Symposium, pp. 63-71. , A.A.
