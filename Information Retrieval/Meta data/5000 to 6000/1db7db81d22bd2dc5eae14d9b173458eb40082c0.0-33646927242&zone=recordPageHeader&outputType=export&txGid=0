Simple theories suggest that global warming will reduce the strength of the mean tropical atmospheric circulation4,5. An important aspect of this tropical circulation is a large-scale zonal (east-west) overturning of air across the equatorial Pacific Ocean - driven by convection to the west and subsidence to the east - known as the Walker circulation6. Here we explore changes in tropical Pacific circulation since the mid-nineteenth century using observations and a suite of global climate model experiments. Observed Indo-Pacific sea level pressure reveals a weakening of the Walker circulation. The size of this trend is consistent with theoretical predictions, is accurately reproduced by climate model simulations and, within the climate models, is largely due to anthropogenic forcing. The climate model indicates that the weakened surface winds have altered the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These results support model projections of further weakening of tropical atmospheric circulation during the twenty-first century4,5,7. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Earth (planet); Global warming; Heat convection; Mathematical models; Tropical engineering; Atmospheric structure; Earth atmosphere; Natural sciences; Radiation; Thermoanalysis; Anthropogenic forcing; Atmospheric circulation; Climate models; Radiative balance; Climate model simulations; Thermal structure; Tropical atmospheric circulation; Atmospherics; Tropics; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric general circulation model; climate modeling; global warming; human activity; nineteenth century; radiation balance; radiative forcing; sea level pressure; tropical region; Walker circulation; zonal wind; convection; global climate; simulation; theoretical study; tropical environment; accuracy; air; anthropogenic forcing; article; atmosphere; force; global climate; greenhouse effect; Pacific Ocean; pressure; priority journal; sea level; simulation; thermodynamics; tropical atmospheric circulation; tropics; wind; air; atmosphere; history; human activities; theoretical model; time; tropic climate; wind; climate; model; temperature; tropics; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Pacific Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean (West); sea water; Air Movements; Atmosphere; Greenhouse Effect; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Human Activities; Models, Theoretical; Pacific Ocean; Seawater; Time Factors; Tropical Climate; Wind",,,,,,"Houghton, J., (2001) Climate Change 2007: The Scientific Basis, , Cambridge Univ.
