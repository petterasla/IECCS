Using the data of the Tokyo metropolitan W2IO table, I apply this model to obtain the optimal wastewater treatment options under alternative scenarios. The Pareto frontiers of environmental loads are derived to show the trade-off relationships among various types of environmental load and the effect of the introduction of high-temperature incineration of dewatered sludge on the generation of environmental loads. The main conclusion of the study is that when all three types of environmental load (landfill level, global warming potential, and chemical oxygen demand) are considered, the introduction of high-temperature incineration causes the widening of the Pareto frontier of environmental loads and also causes it to move closer to the origin. © 2011 by Yale University.","Emission reduction; Environmental load; Industrial ecology; Input-output model; Sewage sludge; Waste incineration","Dewatered sludge; Emission reduction; Environmental loads; Global warming potential; High temperature; Industrial ecology; Input-output; Input-output model; Linear programming models; Pareto frontiers; Trade-off relationship; Chemical oxygen demand; Computer programming; Global warming; Ground vehicle parts and equipment; Incineration; Linear programming; Pareto principle; Reclamation; Sewage sludge; Waste incineration; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Industrial water treatment; chemical oxygen demand; emission control; global warming; high temperature; identification method; incineration; industrial ecology; landfill; linearity; metropolitan area; numerical model; sludge; trade-off; waste management; wastewater; water treatment",,,,,,"Azapagic, A., Clift, R., Life-cycle assessment and linear-programming: Environmental optimization of product system (1995) Computers & Chemical Engineering, 19, pp. S229-S234; Azapagic, A., Clift, R., Linear programming as a tool in life cycle assessment (1998) International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 3 (6), pp. 305-316; Azapagic, A., Clift, R., Life cycle assessment and multiobjective optimisation (1999) Journal of Cleaner Production, 7, pp. 135-143; Bloemhof-Ruwaard, J.M., Koudijs, H.G., Vis, J.C., Environmental impacts of fat blends: A methodological study combining life cycle assessment, multicriteria decision analysis and linear programming (1999) Environmental and Resource Economics, 6, pp. 371-387; (2004) Technique investigation annual report of 2004, , Bureau of Sewerage, Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
