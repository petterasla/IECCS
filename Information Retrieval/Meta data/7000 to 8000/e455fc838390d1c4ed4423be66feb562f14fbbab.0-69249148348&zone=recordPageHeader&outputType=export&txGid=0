Although these temperatures are easily observed in individual stands, extrapolating the net temperature effect to an actively logged terrain is difficult due to the heterogeneous mixture of different forest stand heights and densities. Previous work has related the percentage of tree shade observed in remotely sensed imagery to forest stand structure; we further developed this proxy to derive an estimate of the near-surface daytime air temperature during the summer months. This temperature proxy can be integrated across a region using both actual shade from the modern landscape and an idealized data set representing old-growth forest. In our 10 × 20 km study area on Mt. Adams, Washington, the temperature difference between these two data sets implies that as much as 0.6°C of recent near-surface air temperature rise may be attributed to land cover change. Our results demonstrate that differences in regional temperatures caused by industrial-scale logging are large enough to play a significant role in other physical system responses, such as the retreat of alpine glaciers near logged forests. Because industrial-scale logging is globally pervasive and operates in the same timescale and direction as global warming trends, forcings due to land cover change may have been heretofore overlooked as a cause of the retreat of some glacier systems.
