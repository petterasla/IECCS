The production of these gases is dominated by natural sources, but smaller, important anthropogenic sources, such as agricultural fumigation and/or biomass burning, also exist. As absorbers of infrared radiation these gases are of interest for their potential effect on the tropospheric energy balance as well as for chemical interactions. In this study we estimate the radiative forcing and Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) of CH<inf>3</inf>Cl and CH<inf>3</inf>Br. Our calculations use an infrared radiative transfer model based on the correlated κ -distribution algorithm for band absorption. Radiative forcing values of 0.0047 W/m2 per part per billion by volume (ppbv) for CH<inf>3</inf>Cl in the troposphere and 0.0049 W/m2 per ppbv for CH<inf>3</inf>Br in the troposphere were obtained. On a per molecule basis the radiative forcing values are about 2% of the forcing of CFC-11 and about 270 times the forcing of CO<inf>2</inf>. GWPs for these gases are about 8 for CH<inf>3</inf>Cl and about 4 for CH<inf>3</inf>Br (100 year time integration, CO<inf>2</inf> = 1). These results indicate that while CH<inf>3</inf>Cl and CH<inf>3</inf>Br have direct GWPs similar to that of CH<inf>4</inf>, the current emission rates are too low to contribute meaningfully to atmospheric greenhouse heating effects.
