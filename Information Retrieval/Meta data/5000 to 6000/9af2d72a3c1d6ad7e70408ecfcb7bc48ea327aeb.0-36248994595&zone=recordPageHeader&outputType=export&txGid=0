An attempt was made to monitor CO2 levels in ambient air of Nagpur city at industrial, commercial and residential sites. In addition to this a remote sensing studies and biotic survey for floral biodiversity were carried out to study the green cover at respective sampling locations. The observations showed that the largest amount of CO2 occurred at night due to absence of photosynthesis and lowest concentration of CO2 was observed in the afternoon due to photosynthesis at its maximum level. The most pollution tolerant species found in Nagpur city are having higher Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) value, which acts as a natural sink for CO2 sequestration. In case of commercial site the CO2 level is highest (366 ppm) because of lowest vegetation and vehicular pollution. The generation of database of CO2 concentration and floral biodiversity along with percentage of green cover helps to formulate the strategy for prevention of global worming phenomenon. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","CO2 sequestration; Greenhouse; Remote sensing; Vegetation","Air pollution; Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Air pollution tolerance index (APTI); Carbon dioxide sequestration; Environmental parameters; Environmental impact assessments; carbon dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; biodiversity; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; flora; urban area; vegetation cover; air analysis; air pollution; ambient air; article; biodiversity; controlled study; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; greenhouse; greenhouse effect; India; industrial area; night; photosynthesis; plant ecology; species difference; vegetation; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; India; Time Factors; Asia; Eurasia; India; Maharashtra; Nagpur; South Asia",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Bazzaz, F.A., (1996) Plants in Changing Environment, Linking Physiological Population and Community Ecology, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Beadle, C.L., Jarvis, P.G., Neilson, R.E., Leaf conductance as related to xylem water potential and carbon dioxide concentration in Sitka Spruce (1979) Physiologia Plantarum, 45, pp. 158-166; (2006), http://www.iaea.org/inis/aws/eedrb/data/IN-enemc.html, Energy and Environment Data Reference bank (EEDRB) Link toGarg, A., Shukla, P.R., (1952) Emission Inventory of India, , New Delhi: Tata Mac Grow Hills; Grimmond, C.S.B., King, T.S., Gropley, F.P., Nowak, D.J., Souch, C., Local scale fluxes of carbon dioxide in urban environments: Methodological challenge and results from Chikago (2002) Environmental Pollution, 116, pp. 5243-5254; Highwood, E.J., Shine, K.P., Radiative forcing and global warming potential of 11 halogenated compounds (2000) Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy & Radiative Transfer, 66, pp. 169-183; (1990) Climate Change, , Houghton, J.
