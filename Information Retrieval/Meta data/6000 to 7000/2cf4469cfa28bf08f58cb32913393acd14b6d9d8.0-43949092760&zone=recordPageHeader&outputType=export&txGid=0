This paper examines scientific and political representations of Arctic indigenous peoples that have been central to the production and articulation of these claims. ACIA employs novel forms and strategies of representation that reflect changing conceptual models and practices of global change science and depict indigenous peoples as expert, exotic, and at-risk. These portrayals emerge alongside the growing political activism of Arctic indigenous peoples who present themselves as representatives or embodiments of climate change itself as they advocate for climate change mitigation policies. These mutually constitutive forms of representation suggest that scientific ways of seeing the global environment shape and are shaped by the public image and voice of global citizens. Likewise, the authority, credibility, and visibility of Arctic indigenous activists derive, in part, from their status as at-risk experts, a status buttressed by new scientific frameworks and methods that recognize and rely on the local experiences and knowledges of indigenous peoples. Analyses of these relationships linking scientific and political representations of Arctic climate change build upon science and technology studies (STS) scholarship on visualization, challenge conventional notions of globalization, and raise questions about power and accountability in global climate change research. © SSS and SAGE Publications.","Climate change; Global environmental change; Globalization; Indigenous knowledge; Indigenous peoples; Representation; Visualization","Arctic; article; climate; ethnic and racial groups; history; human; Arctic Regions; Climate; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Population Groups",,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Kelly, P.M., 'Social Vulnerability to Climate Change and the Architecture of Entitlements' (1999) Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, 4, pp. 253-66; Svetlana, A., (1983) The Art of Describing: Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press); Climate Impact Assessment, A., (2004) Impacts of A Warming Arctic, , http://amap.no/acia/, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press), available at: accessed 17 July 2007; Climate Impact Assessment, A., (2005) Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); Globe, B., (2004) 'A Lift for Cape Wind', Editorial (9 November); Karen, B., 'Native contributions to Arctic Science at Barrow, Alaska' (1997) Arctic, 50 (3), pp. 277-83; Impact Assessment Program, C., (1975) Monograph 5: The Impacts of Climate Change on the Biosphere, , Washington, DC: US Department of Transportation); Lorraine, D., Galison, P., 'The Image of Objectivity' (1992) Representations, 40, pp. 81-128; David Leonard, D., Fenge, T., Northern Lights Against POPs: Combatting Toxic Threats in the Arctic Published for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference Canada; Joseph, D., (2003) Picturing Personhood: Brain Scans and Biomedical Identity, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press); Earthjustice, (2004) Inuit Leader Sheila Watt-Cloutier Announces Intention to File A Human Rights Claim, , www.earthjustice.org/news/display.html?ID=935; Ford James, D., Smit, B., A Framework for Assessing the Vulnerability of Communities in the Canadian Arctic to Risks Associated with Climate Change (2004) Arctic, 57, pp. 389-400; Shari, F., (2003) When the Weather Is Uggianaqtuq: Inuit Observations of Environmental Change, , Boulder, CO: University of Colorado Geography Department Cartography Lab, Distributed by National Snow and Ice Data Center; CD-ROM); Gordon, F., Law, J., (1988) Picturing Power: Visual Depiction and Social Relations, , London & New York: Routledge & Kegan Paul); Emily, G., (2004) World Press Weighs in on the Arctic Council Report, , www.worldchanging.com/archives/001550.html; Lorne, G., Ecological Indian Is a Myth: Neither Criminals Nor Saints, Early Natives Were Simply Human (1999) Edmonton Journal, , www.lewrockwell.com/orig/gunter1.html; John, H., (2004) Scientists Find Arctic Warming Quickly, , www.livescience.com/environment/global_warming_041108.html, Associated Press (8 November), available at <; (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability: The Contribution of Working Group II to the Third Scientific Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Cambridge : Cambridge University Press); (2000) Inuit Observations on Climate Change (Film), , International Institute for Sustainable Development; Circumpolar Conference, I., (2004) Plenary Intervention at the Tenth COP to the un Framework Convention on Climate Change, , www.inuitcircumpolar.com/index.php?ID=283&Lang=En, Buenos Aires, Argentina (17 December), available at <; Sheila, J., Long Martello, M., (2004) Earthly Politics: Local and Global in Environmental Governance, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press); Joanna, K., (2004) 'Sheila Watt-Cloutier', Encyclopedia of the Arctic, , www.routledge-ny.com/ref/arctic/watt.html, New York: Routledge), available at <; Jeffrey, K., Earth is at the Tipping Point (2006) TIME, pp. 34-42; Pia, K., Mead, L., Schipper, L., Wilkins, H., IPCC-22 Highlights, Wednesday, 10 November 2004 (2004) Earth Negotiations Bulletin, 12 (247). , www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12247e.html; Shepard, K., (1999) The Ecological Indian: Myth and History, , New York: W.W.
