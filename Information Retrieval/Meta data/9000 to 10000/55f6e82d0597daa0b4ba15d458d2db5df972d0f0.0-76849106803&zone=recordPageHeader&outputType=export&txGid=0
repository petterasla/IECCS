Principal component analysis (PCA), a frequently used component extraction technique, provides an orthogonal representation of the multivariate dataset and maximizes the variance explained by successive components. A disadvantage of PCA, however, is that the interpretability of the second and higher components may be limited. For this reason, a Varimax rotation is often applied to the PCA solution to enhance the interpretability of the components by maximizing a simple structure. An alternative rotational approach is known as independent component analysis (ICA), which finds a set of underlying 'source signals' which drive the multivariate 'mixed' dataset. Here we compare the capacity of PCA, the Varimax rotation and ICA in explaining climate variability present in globally distributed SST anomaly (SSTA) data. We find that phenomena which are global in extent, such as the global warming trend and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are well represented using PCA. In contrast, the Varimax rotation provides distinct advantages in interpreting more localized phenomena such as variability in the tropical Atlantic. Finally, our analysis suggests that the interpretability of independent components (ICs) appears to be low. This does not diminish the statistical advantages of deriving components that are mutually independent, with potential applications ranging from synthetically generating multivariate datasets, developing statistical forecasts, and reconstructing spatial datasets from patchy observations at multiple point locations. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate variability; EI nino-southern oscillation; Independent component analysis; Principal component analysis; Sea surface temperature; Varimax","Climate variability; Component extraction; Data sets; EI nino-southern oscillation; Ei nino-southern oscillations; High-dimensional; Independent components; Interpretability; Multiple points; Multivariate data sets; Orthogonal representation; Potential applications; Sea surface temperatures; Simple structures; Source signals; Southern Oscillation; Spatial datasets; SST anomalies; Tropical atlantic; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Global warming; Hemodynamics; Independent component analysis; Multivariant analysis; Nickel compounds; Rotation; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Principal component analysis; climate modeling; climate variation; data set; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; sea surface topography; signal processing; spatial variation; trend analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Tropical)",,,,,,"Aires, F., Chedin, A., Nadal, J.P., Analyse de series temporelles geophysiques et theorie de l'information: L'analyse en composants independants (1999) Geophysique Externe, Climat Et Environnement/external Geophysics, Climate and Environment, 328, pp. 569-575; Aires, F., Chedin, A., Nadal, J.P., Independent component analysis of multivariate time series: Application to the tropical SST variability (2000) Journal of Geophysical Research-atmospheres, 105 (D13), pp. 17437-17455; Aires, F., Rossow, W.B., Chedin, A., Rotation of EOFs by the independent component analysis: Toward a solution of the mixing problem in the decomposition of geophysical time series (2002) Journal of The Atmospheric Sciences, 59 (1), pp. 111-123; Basak, J., Sudarshan, A., Trivedi, D., Santhanam, M.S., Weather data mining using independent component analysis (2004) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, pp. 239-253; Cane, M.A., Clement, A.C., Kaplan, A., Kushnir, Y., Pozdhyakov, D., Seager, R., Zebiak, S.E., Murtugudde, R., Twentieth-century sea surface temperature trends (1997) Science, 275 (5302), pp. 957-960; Ciaramella, A., Lauro, E.D., Martino, S.D., Lieto, B.D., Falanga, M., Tagliaferri, R., Characterisation of Strombolian events by using independent component analysis (2004) Nonlinear Processes In Geophysics, 11, pp. 453-461; Comon, P., Independent component analysis: A new concept?
