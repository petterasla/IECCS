Even though temperatures in such high-latitude regions should also increase under a doubling of CO2, as long as those temperatures remain below freezing, the increased precipitation should accumulate as snow. A study of both current and double CO2 temperature and precipitation data for all land areas poleward of 60° latitude using three different general circulation models suggests possible changes in snow accumulation due to increasing CO2. Increased snow accumulation will occur in the Antarctic whereas a small decrease in snow depth is to be expected in the Northern Hemisphere. Total snow accumulation for all land areas poleward of latitude 60° is found to increase under a double CO2 scenario.","General circulation models; Global climate change; Snow cover","carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; GCM; global warming; snow cover",,,,,,"Gleick, P.H., Regional hydrologic consequences of increases in atmospheric CO2 and other gases (1987) Clin.
