Energy consumption of prototype European-style refrigerators made with a foam formulation with HFC-245fa as the blowing agent was measured and compared with energy consumption of the same model as currently produced (using a foam with a pentane blend for the blowing agent). Results were used in a LCCP study, considering both direct and indirect climate impacts due to blowing agent emissions and energy consumption in manufacturing processes and over the life cycle of the refrigerator. An assumption is made that the refrigerator is built and used in the European market. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.
