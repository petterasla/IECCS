We asked whether the frequency of warm temperature anomalies is positively related to the frequency of coral disease across 1,500 km of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. We used a new high-resolution satellite dataset of ocean temperature and 6 y of coral disease and coral cover data from annual surveys of 48 reefs to answer this question. We found a highly significant relationship between the frequencies of warm temperature anomalies and of white syndrome, an emergent disease, or potentially, a group of diseases, of Pacific reef-building corals. The effect of temperature was highly dependent on coral cover because white syndrome outbreaks followed warm years, but only on high (>50%) cover reefs, suggesting an important role of host density as a threshold for outbreaks. Our results indicate that the frequency of temperature anomalies, which is predicted to increase in most tropical oceans, can increase the susceptibility of corals to disease, leading to outbreaks where corals are abundant. © 2007 Bruno et al.",,"article; Australia; coral reef; disease predisposition; driver; environmental change; environmental disease; environmental temperature; human; marine environment; nonhuman; temperature stress; tropics; animal; animal disease; Anthozoa; ecosystem; epidemic; greenhouse effect; heat; Pacific Ocean; physiology; Anthozoa; Animal Diseases; Animals; Anthozoa; Disease Outbreaks; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Hot Temperature; Pacific Ocean; Queensland",,,,,,"Sanford, E., Regulation of keystone predation by small changes in ocean temperature (1999) Science, 283, pp. 2095-2097; Allen, A.P., Brown, J.H., Gillooly, J.F., Global biodiversity, biochemical kinetics, and the energetic-equivalence rule (2002) Science, 297, pp. 1545-1548; Allen, A.P., Gillooly, J.F., Savage, V.M., Brown, J.H., Kinetic effects of temperature on rates of genetic divergence and speciation (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 103, pp. 9130-9135; Thomas, C.D., Cameron, A., Green, R.E., Bakkenes, M., Beaumont, L.J., Extinction risk from climate change (2004) Nature, 427, pp. 145-148; Helmuth, B., Mieszkowska, N., Moore, P., Hawkins, S.J., Living on n the edge of two worlds: Forecasting the responses of rocky intertidal ecosystems to climate change (2006) Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst, 37, pp. 373-404; O'Connor, M.I., Bruno, J.F., Gaines, S.D., Halpern, B.S., Lester, S.E., Temperature control of larval dispersal and its implications for marine ecology, evolution, and conservation (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 104, pp. 1266-1271; Harvell, C.D., Mitchell, C.E., Ward, J.R., Altizer, S., Dobson, A.P., Climate warming and disease risks for terrestrial and marine biota (2002) Science, 296, pp. 2158-2162; Lafferty, K.D., Holt, R.D., How should environmental stress affect the population dynamics of disease?
