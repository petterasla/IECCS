Given these findings, a 'wait-and-see' stance towards new initiatives in energy and environmental policy is not economically justifiable. Achieving signifincant emissions reductions, however, will require commitments to policies aimed at enabling energy markets to function more efficiently and supporting legislation where market forces do not suffice. © 1991.","Economics; Global warming; Greenhouse gases","emission control; energy consumption; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; market efficiency; pollution problem",,,,,,"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Policy-makers Summary of the Formulation of Response Strategies, report prepared for IPCC by Working Group IIIIPCC, (1990) Policymakers Summary of the Scientific Assessment of Climate Change, , report prepared for, IPCC by Working Group I; World Energy Conference, (1989) World Energy Horizons: 2000–2020, , Editions Technip, Paris; A.S.

The capital cost drops to $1 670/kW for the target light-water reactor. These estimates are from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The nuclear fuel-cycle cost $0.84/GJ (¢1.11/kWhe: EPRI's projection for 1990 to 2000) and the operations and maintenance costs (¢0.91/kWhe) are the 1985 US averages for nuclear plants. This busbar-cost derivation is shown in R.H. Williams and E.D. Larson, ‘Expanding roles for gas turbines in power generation’, in T.B. Johansson, B. Bodlund and R.H. Williams, eds, Electricity: Efficient End-Use and New Generation Technologies, and Their Planning Implications, Lund University Press, Sweden, 1989, p 525The indirect costs of implementing measures vary according to many factors. Performance standards, for example, can have a negligible cost per unit of energy saved while costs can be higher for conservation programmes, especially during initial ‘learning’ periods. European lighting efficiency programmes have shown implementation costs of only ¢0.3/kWh, ie approximately 1/20 the cost of the energy they save. See E.

The prime attractiveness of methanol vehicles lies in the opportunity to use biomass feedstocks. However, creating a methanol vehicle fleet would also create a market for methanol produced from coal feedstocks. This eventuality should be avoided because producing, transporting, and burning coal-based methanol leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline, compared on a per-vehicle-kilometre basis; see C. Difiglio et al, ‘Cost effectiveness of future fuel economy improvements’, The Energy Journal, Vol 11, No 1, pp 65–86. It should be noted that methanol vehicles are potential emitters of large quantities of formaldehyde: a highly toxic gas that can also contribute to the production of tropospheric ozone. Formaldehyde emissions can be [[Truncated]]; This is the fuel economy inurban driving conditions. Due to the regenerative breaking system in the Impact, urban and highway mileage are about equal.

This discussion is based on. The electricity production potential is 2 780 TWhe/year. The potential contribution of barbojo depends on how much of the resource can be covered cost-effectively. By utilizing only bagasse fuel in this estimate, 900 TWh could be produced, or 55% of 1987 electricity demand. (Based on note c to Table 13 of Ogden et al.). This scenario uses biomass-integrated gasifier technology with intercooled steam-injected gas turbines (BIG/ISTIG). The scenario is calculated assuming growth in sugar cane production of 3%/year (the historical rate of annual growth since 1960) over the 40-year period. Half of the growth is assumed to be committed to sugar production (equivalent to the World Bank projection of the sugar demand growth rate to 1995) and half to the alcohol production. This much more efficient use of potential cane resources would considerably improve the economics of the cane industry, and in effect turn it into an electricity-production industry with sugar and/or alcohol as marketable byproductsSolar, The Potential of Renewable Energy: An Interlaboratory White Paper (1990) Solar Energy Research Institute Report, SERI/TP-260-3674; Solar Energy Research Institute, The Potential of Renewable Energy: An Interlabotoratory White Paper (1990) Solar Energy Research Institute Report, SERI/TP-260-3674; Carlson, Low-cost power from thin-film photovoltaics (1989) Electricity: Efficient End-Use and New Generation Technologies, and Their Planning Implication, p. 595. , T.B.

As an incentive to exceed the target efficiency level, approximately $80/refrigerator will be paid to the manufacturer for each reduction of 15% in electricity-use beyond the target value given. The procurement guidelines also invited manufacturers to create an ‘energy label’ to compare the energy-use of their design to that of models already on the market.
