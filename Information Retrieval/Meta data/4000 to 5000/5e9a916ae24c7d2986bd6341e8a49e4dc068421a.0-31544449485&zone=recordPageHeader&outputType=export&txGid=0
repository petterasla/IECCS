The new model and the ZHOU & ZHANG model 1996 were then used to simulate NPP for agricultural land and natural ecosystems in China, respectively. The results showed that the overall accuracy improved when simulating the present NPP. As a general trend, NPP declined from southeast to northwest, with the lowest NPP in the Xinjiang Autonomous region. Except in extremely arid or extremely humid areas, agricultural NPP was usually lower than natural NPP, especially in northeastern China and the North China plain. The two models were also used to simulate NPP in China under three climatic change scenarios. The results demonstrated that if air temperature increased by 2°C and rainfall decreased by 20 %, both low NPP and high NPP area would decrease, resulting in an increase of medium NPP area. The other two scenarios, characterized by a temperature increase of 2°C, combined with precipitation increase of 20 % and with precipitation unchanged, showed a decrease in low NPP area and a increase in medium and high NPP area, however, the former resulted in a greater medium NPP increase. In conclusion, our approach supplied better predictions than those based on only a natural NPP model.","Agricultural vegetation; China; Global climate change; Net primary productivity (NPP); Terrestrial ecosystem",,,,,,,"Cramer, W., Field, C.B., Comparing global models of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) (1999) Global Change Biol., 5 (1 SUPPL.), pp. iii-iv; Kicklighter, D.W., Bondeau, A., Moore, B., Churkina, G., Nemry, B., Ruimy, A., Schloss, A.L., Comparing global models of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP), overview and key result (1999) Global Change Biol., 5 (1 SUPPL.), pp. 1-15; Feng, Q., Cheng, G., Endo, K., Carbon storage in desertified lands: A case study from North China (2001) Geojournal., 51, pp. 181-189; Gao, Q., Yu, M., Yang, X., An analysis of sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystems in China to climate change using spatial simulation (2000) Climatic Change, 47, pp. 373-400; Hou, X.Y., Sun, S.Z., Zhang, J.W., He, M.G., Wang, Y.F., Kong, D.Z., Wang, S.Q., (1982) Vegetation Map of People's Republic of China, , China map publisher, Beijing; Luo, T., Li, W., Zhu, H., Estimated biomass and productivity of natural vegetation on the Tibetan plateau (2002) Ecol.
