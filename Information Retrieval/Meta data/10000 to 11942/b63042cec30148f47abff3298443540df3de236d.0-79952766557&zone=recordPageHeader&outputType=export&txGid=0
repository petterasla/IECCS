Earlier floral anthesis has been suggested, in turn, to have a role in human disease by increasing time of exposure to pollen that causes allergic rhinitis and related asthma. However, earlier floral initiation does not necessarily alter the temporal duration of the pollen season, and, to date, no consistent continental trend in pollen season length has been demonstrated. Here we report that duration of the ragweed (Ambrosia spp.) pollen season has been increasing in recent decades as a function of latitude in North America. Latitudinal effects on increasing season length were associated primarily with a delay in first frost of the fall season and lengthening of the frost free period. Overall, these data indicate a significant increase in the length of the ragweed pollen season by as much as 13-27 d at latitudes above ∼44°N since 1995. This is consistent with recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections regarding enhanced warming as a function of latitude. If similar warming trends accompany long-term climate change, greater exposure times to seasonal allergens may occur with subsequent effects on public health.","Aerobiology; Allergies; Global warming","allergen; article; autumn; climate change; flowering; latitude; North America; priority journal; ragweed pollen; seasonal variation; warming; Ambrosia; Asthma; Climate; Humans; North America; Pollen; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Seasons; Temperature; Ambrosia",,,,,,"(2005) Allergies and Hayfever, , www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastabs/allergies.htm, Available at Accessed February 3, 2011; Frenz, D.A., Interpreting atmospheric pollen counts for use in clinical allergy: Allergic symptomology (2001) Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 86, pp. 150-158; Chapman, J.A., Aeroallergens of southeastern Missouri (1986) Grana, 25, pp. 235-246; Gergen, P.J., Turkeltaub, P.C., Kovar, M.G., The prevalence of allergic skin test reactivity to eight common aeroallergens in the U.S. population: Results from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1987) Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 80 (5), pp. 669-679; Wodehouse, R.P., (1971) Hayfever Plants, , Hafner, New York, 2nd Ed; (2008) A Review of the Impact of Climate Variability and Change in Aeroallergens and Their Associated Effects (Final Report), , United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA, Washington, DC), EPA/600/R-06/164F; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.
