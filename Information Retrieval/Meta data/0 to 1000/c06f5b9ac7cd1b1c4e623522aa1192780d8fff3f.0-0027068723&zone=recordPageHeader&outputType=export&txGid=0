Effects of deep peat fire on decomposition were also simulated by burning the upper layer (0-10 cm) of peat and adding the ash to peat samples from the 10-20 cm layer. CH4 release averaged &lt;1% of total carbon loss in flooded samples. Release of CO2 was 4.9 times greater from the 0-10 cm layer than from the 30-40 cm layer. Higher temperatures strongly promoted decomposition of samples exposed to drying cycles but had little effect on decomposition of continuously flooded samples. Ash addition had variable effects on CO2 emissions but may have promoted CH4 production. The results indicate that deeper peats are resistant to decay even when exposed to warm, aerobic conditions. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide; decomposition; drought; fire; methane; peat; Canada, Alberta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10510761,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027068723
