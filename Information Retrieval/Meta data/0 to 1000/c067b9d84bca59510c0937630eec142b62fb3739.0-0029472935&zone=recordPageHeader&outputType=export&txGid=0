We can infer the water vapor feedback from the data. Results of this study indicate that water vapor feedback over the Arctic Ocean is substantially more complex than in other regions because of the relative lack of convective coupling between the surface and the atmosphere and the different thermodynamic and radiative environment in the Arctic. -from Authors",,"clear sky greenhouse effect; climate feedback mechanism; convective coupling; greenhouse effect; polar meteorology; water vapour; water vapour feedback; Arctic Ocean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029472935
