The three-body mechanics of the problem are investigated to optimize the shield location, thus minimizing the shield mass and improving on previous studies of this concept. While shield mass is minimized, the required mass is still of order 1011 kg to offset an enhancement of greenhouse warming of order 2 K. Clearly, such schemes require significant technological capabilities, although the optimization presented in this paper reduces the scale of the problem to some extent.","Climate control; Global warming; Solar shield","Global surface temperature; Greenhouse warming; Lagrange points; Minimum mass; Order 2; Solar shield; Technological capability; Three body; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Greenhouses; Optimization; Climate control",,,,,,"Seifritz, W., Mirrors to halt global warming (1989) Nature, 340, p. 603; Early, J.T., Space-based solar shield to offset greenhouse effect (1989) JBIS, 42, pp. 567-569; Hudson, H., A space parasol as a countermeasure against the greenhouse effect (1991) JBIS, 44, pp. 139-141; Mautner, M., A space-based solar screen against climatic warming (1991) JBIS, 44, pp. 135-138; Roy, K.I., (2001) Solar Sails: An Answer to Global Warming, CP552, Space Technology and Applications International Form, American Institute of Physics, , New York; Govindasamy, B., Caldeira, K., Geoengineering Earth's radiation balance to mitigate CO 2-induced climate change (2000) Geophysical Research Letters, 27, pp. 2141-2144; Mclnnes, C.R., Solar sailing: Technology, dynamics and mission applications (1999) Springer-Praxis Series in Space Science and Technology, , London; (1979) Asteroids, , T.
