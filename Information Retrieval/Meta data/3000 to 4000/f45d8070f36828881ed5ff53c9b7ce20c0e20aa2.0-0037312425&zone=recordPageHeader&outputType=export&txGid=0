The existence of 'pre-adapted' individuals in standing tree populations would reduce temperature-based advantages for invading species and, if general, bring into question assumptions currently used in models of global climate change. Our results demonstrate a methodology useful for investigating the important ecological issue of adaptation vs. range shifts as a means of response to climate change.","Climate change; Global change; Global warming; Population structure; Sympatric speciation; Vegetation change","adaptation; climate change; global warming; population structure; speciation (biology); tree; Betula; Betula pendula",,,,,,"Andreasen, K., Baldwin, B.G., Unequal evolutionary rates between annual and perennial lineages of checker mallows (Sidalcea, Malvaceae): Evidence from 18S-26S rDNA internal and external transcribed spacers (2001) Mol.
