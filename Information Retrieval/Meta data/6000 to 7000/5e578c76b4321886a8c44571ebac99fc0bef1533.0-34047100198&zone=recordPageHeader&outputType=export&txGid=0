Although CO2 uptake during the growing season can be substantial, losses during winter months reduce annual sequestration, potentially turning grazing lands into net carbon sources. The goal of this research was to quantify the magnitude of winter fluxes for humid-temperate pastures in the northeastern USA. The study was conducted from 2003 to 2005 on two pastures in the ridge and valley region of central Pennsylvania, one dominated by a mix of cool-season grasses and the other transitioning from an alfalfa to mixed-grass pasture. Pasture-scale CO2 fluxes were quantified using eddy covariance techniques. The alfalfa pasture was less of a CO2 source to the atmosphere during winter months (1 December to 31 March) than the grass pasture, averaging 2.68 g CO2 m-2 day-1 compared with 3.09 g CO2 m-2 day-1 for the grass pasture. Cumulative efflux for the winter months averaged 326 g CO2 m-2 (88 g C m-2) for the alfalfa and 375 g CO2 m-2 (101 g C m-2) for the grass pasture. In the absence of snow cover, eddy covariance measurements estimated that photosynthetic CO2 uptake occurred at temperatures below 0 °C. Canopy and leaf chamber measurements in the field and in controlled environments suggested minimum temperatures for photosynthetic CO2 uptake of about -4 °C. Even when daytime uptake occurred, nighttime efflux from the system was greater so that the pastures remained CO2 sources throughout the winter.","Carbon sequestration; Dormant-season; Photosynthesis; Respiration","alfalfa; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; eddy covariance; global warming; growing season; nutrient uptake; pasture; photosynthesis; respiration; North America; Pennsylvania; United States; Medicago sativa; Poaceae",,,,,,"Amiro, B., Orchansky, A., Sass, A., A perspective on carbon dioxide flux measurements using an open-path infrared gas analyzer in cold environments (2006) Proceedings Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 27th Conference, , San Diego, California; Burba, G.G., Anderson, D.J., Xu, L., McDermitt, D.K., Correcting apparent off-season CO2 uptake due to surface heating of an open path gas analyzer: progress report of an ongoing study (2006) Proceedings Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 27th Conference, , San Diego, CA; Dai, A., Wigley, T.M.L., Boville, B.A., Kiehl, J.T., Buja, L.E., Climates of the 20th and 21st centuries simulated by the NCAR climate system model (2001) J.
