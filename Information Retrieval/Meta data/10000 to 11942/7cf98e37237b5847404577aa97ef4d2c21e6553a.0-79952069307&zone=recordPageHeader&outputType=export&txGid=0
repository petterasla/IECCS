Until recently, empirical evidence generally suggests that there is a negative relationship between temperature and income, and, therefore, global warming has an adverse impact on economic activity. However, Nordhaus (2006) argues that the temperature-income relationship depends on how income is measured. We show in this paper that the results of Nordhaus (2006) may be due to an omitted-variable problem. Based on a well-motivated temperature-income model, we find that the relationship between temperature and income is not dependent on income measurement. Our regression results show that the adverse impact of an increase of 1. °C in temperature can be as much as a 3% decrease in total income for the G-7 nations. Therefore, our results suggest an aggressive climate mitigation policy. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Income; Quantile regression; Temperature","emission control; empirical analysis; environmental economics; estimation method; global warming; income; measurement method; numerical model; pollution policy; regression analysis; temperature effect",,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J., The colonial origins of comparative development: an empirical investigation (2001) American Economic Review, 91, pp. 1369-1401; Choinière, C.J., Horowitz, J.K., (2006), A production function approach to the GDP-temperature relationship.
