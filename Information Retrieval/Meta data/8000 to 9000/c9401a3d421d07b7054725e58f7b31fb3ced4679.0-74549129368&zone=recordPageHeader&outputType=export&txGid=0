Deberiotstraat 32, 3000 Leuven, Belgium","There is growing awareness that microevolutionary dynamics may alter ecological processes. Rising temperatures under global change are expected to open windows for establishment of species and genotypes from warmer regions. Yet, microevolutionary tracking of temperature change by local populations may reduce establishment success of these immigrants. We exposed a UK population of the water flea, Daphnia magna, to two temperature regimes during a 1.5-year experimental evolution trial, and subsequently compared competitive strength of non-warm-adapted and warm-adapted D. magna in competition with French genotypes. Our results indicate that local microevolutionary responses to global warming may reduce establishment success of immigrant genotypes that are preadapted to warmer climate. Simulation modeling shows that microevolution results in a reduced likelihood and speed of displacement of local populations by immigrant genotypes under realistic immigrant/resident ratios. We conclude that local evolutionary dynamics may shift the relative impact of local and regional processes in response to global change. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Daphnia; Ecological-evolutionary interface; Establishment success; Evolving metacommunities; Global warming; Immigration; Local adaptation; Rapid evolution; Temperature; Warm-adapted genotypes","computer simulation; crustacean; genotype-environment interaction; global change; global warming; high temperature; immigration; local adaptation; numerical model; temperature effect; United Kingdom; Cladocera; Daphnia; Daphnia magna; Siphonaptera (fleas)",,,,,,"Altermatt, F., Pajunen, V.I., Ebert, D., Climate change affects colonization dynamics in a metacommunity of three Daphnia species (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 1209-1220; Bradshaw, W.E., Holzapfel, C.M., Evolutionary response to rapid climate change (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1477-1478; Bryant, M.J., Reznick, D., Comparative studies of senescence in natural populations of guppies (2008) American Naturalist, 163, pp. 55-68; Carroll, S.P., Facing change: forms and foundations of contemporary adaptation to biotic invasions (2008) Molecular Ecology, 17, pp. 361-372; Carroll, S.P., Hendry, A.P., Reznick, D.N., Fox, C.W., Evolution on ecological time-scales (2007) Functional Ecology, 21, pp. 387-393; Crutsinger, G.M., Souza, L., Sanders, N.J., Intraspecific diversity and dominant genotypes resist plant invasions (2008) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 16-23; Davis, M.B., Shaw, R.G., Etterson, J.R., Evolutionary responses to changing climate (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 1704-1714; De Meester, L., Louette, G., Duvivier, C., Van Damme, C., Michels, E., Genetic composition of resident populations influences establishment success of immigrant species (2007) Oecologia, 153, pp. 431-440; Deutsch, C.A., Tewksbury, J.J., Huey, R.B., Sheldon, K.S., Ghalambor, C.K., Haak, D.C., Martin, P.R., Impacts of climate warming on terrestrial ectotherms across latitude (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), 105, pp. 6668-6672; Feuchtmayr, H., Moran, R., Hatton, K., Global warming and eutrophication: effects on water chemistry and autotrophic communities in experimental hypertrophic shallow lake mesocosms Journal of Applied Ecology, 46, pp. 713-723. , (in press); Figuerola, J., Green, A.J., Dispersal of aquatic organisms by waterbirds: a review of past research and priorities for future studies (2002) Freshwater Biology, 47, pp. 483-494; Franks, S.J., Sim, S., Weis, A.E., Rapid evolution of flowering time by an annual plant in response to a climate fluctuation (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), 104, pp. 1278-1282; Frisch, D., Green, A.J., Figuerola, J., High dispersal capacity of a broad spectrum of aquatic invertebrates via waterbirds (2007) Aquatic Sciences, 69, pp. 568-574; Fussmann, G.F., Loreau, M., Abrams, P.A., Eco-evolutionary dynamics of communities and ecosystems (2007) Functional Ecology, 21, pp. 465-477; Gienapp, P., Teplitsky, C., Alho, J.S., Mills, J.A., Merilä, J., Climate change and evolution: disentangling environmental and genetic responses (2008) Molecular Ecology, 17, pp. 167-178; Gomulkiewicz, R., Holt, R.D., When does evolution by natural selection prevent extinction (1995) Evolution, 49, pp. 201-207; Green, A.J., Figuerola, J., Recent advances in the study of long-distance dispersal of aquatic invertebrates via birds (2005) Diversity and Distributions, 11, pp. 149-156; Hairston N.G., Jr., Ellner, S.P., Geber, M.A., Yoshida, T., Fox, J.A., Rapid evolution and the convergence of ecological and evolutionary time scales (2005) Ecology Letters, 8, pp. 1114-1127; Heino, J., Virkkala, R., Toivonen, H., Climate change and freshwater biodiversity: detected patterns, future trends and adaptations in northern regions (2009) Biological Reviews, 84, pp. 39-54; Hickling, R., Roy, D.B., Hill, J.K., Fox, R., Thomas, C.D., The distributions of a wide range of taxonomic groups are expanding polewards (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 450-455; Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability (2001) Contribution of Working Group II to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC (eds, McCarthy JJ, Canziani OF, Leary NA, Dokken DJ, White KS).
