As they deepen, higher waves will propagate into back-reef areas, altering the ecological and sedimentological zonation patterns and accelerating the erosion of leeward shelves and shores. Resuspended sediment will increase the turbidity, causing the demise of sediment-sensitive corals and psosibly entire reef communities.",,"computer program; coral reef; global warming; modeling; sedimentology; Caribbean Sea",,,,,,"Adey, W.H., Burke, R.R., Holocene bioherms of lesser antilles-geologic control of development (1977) Reefs and Related Carbonates - Ecology and Sedimentology, , S.H.
