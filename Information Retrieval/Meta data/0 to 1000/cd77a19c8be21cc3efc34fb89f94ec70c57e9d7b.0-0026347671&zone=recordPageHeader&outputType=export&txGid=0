The introduction of new chemicals and the increasing ambient levels of existing chemicals have resulted in atmospheric degradation. This paper reviews some of the adverse effects of stratospheric ozone depletion and global warming. Because the atmospheric effects of ozone depletion are fairly well characterized, quantitative risk estimates have been developed. However, because the atmospheric effects of global warming are less understood, public health problems that could be intensified by climate change are assessed qualitatively. The interactive effects of these two phenomena are also discussed.",,"climate; greenhouse effect; human; ozone layer; public health; review; Acclimatization; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Animals; Cataract; Climate; Disease Vectors; Environmental Health; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Incidence; Male; Mortality; Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced; Ozone; Public Health; Risk Factors; Skin Neoplasms; Ultraviolet Rays; United States",,"Ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,,"Longstreth, J.; Battelle Washington Operations, 370 L'Enfant Promenade SW, Washington, DC 20024-2115, United States",,,,,,,,00916765,,EVHPA,1820256,"English","ENVIRON.
