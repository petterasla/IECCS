In this study, a national forest inventory database was used to estimate the past and current pools and fluxes of C in deciduous and coniferous forest and woodland ecosystems (20.7 × 106 ha) of Turkey. Growing C stock was 12.63 t C ha-1 in 1960 and 16.55 t C ha -1 in 1995. Total C store in the whole live woody biomass was estimated at 22.77 t C ha-1 in 1996. The total flux of C from the atmosphere into the forest and woodland ecosystems driven by primary productivity was about 1.46 t C ha-1 (or 30.2 Mt C) in 1996. The estimated net release of C from the forest and woodland ecosystems of Turkey to the atmosphere was about 1.34 t C ha-1 (or 21.5 Mt C) in 1996. When C released was taken into account, net ecosystem sequestration (NES) resulted in 0.12 t C ha-1 per year. Such analytical tools as national forest C budgets are needed to improve our preventive and mitigative strategies for dealing with global climate change.",,"article; biomass; data base; environmental monitoring; forest; priority journal; source sink relationship; Turkey (republic); Atmosphere; Carbon; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Trees; Turkey; Nes",,"Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Mackenzie, F.T., Ver, L.M., Lerman, A., (2002) Chem.
