In Japan, biologists have found climate change is affecting species and ecosystems, including the earlier flowering time of cherry trees which are an important cultural symbol in Japan. Cherry blossom festivals are also important to local economies. This study explored the perceptions of Japanese residents regarding climate change impacts on culturally significant events such as flower timing of cherry trees. We conducted interviews of stakeholders of three cherry blossom festivals, including sixteen organizers of festivals and 26 managers of festival-dependent businesses, to understand their awareness, attitudes and behaviors toward global climate change and impacts on cherry blossom festivals. Most organizers of the festival in Kakunodate were concerned about global warming and its impact on cherry blossom times while organizers of festivals in Nakano and Komoro felt it was unimportant if flower timing affected the festival schedule. Most (92%) managers of festival-dependent businesses mentioned that global warming is occurring and affecting the flower timing of cherry trees, but there were diverse perceptions of global warming impacts on their business. Managers more dependent on income from cherry blossom festivals indicated greater concern for the effects of climate change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Attitude; Cherry blossom festival; Climate change; Interview; Japan; Stakeholder","climate modeling; cultural change; economic impact; flowering; fruit; global climate; global warming; questionnaire survey; stakeholder; Japan",,,,,,"ABC News, 2009 March 21, Japan monitors climate link as cheery blossoms appear early (2009), http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/21/2522589.htm, <> (accessed 04.09)Ando, S., 2004.
