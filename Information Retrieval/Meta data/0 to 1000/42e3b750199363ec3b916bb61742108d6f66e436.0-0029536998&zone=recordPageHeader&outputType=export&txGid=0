Flux correction is used to control the mean climate of the coupled system, and in one configuration of the coupled model, interannual variability in the tropical Pacific is dominated by westward moving anomalies. Through a series of experiments in which the equatorial ocean wave speeds and ocean-atmosphere coupling strength are varied, it is demonstrated that these westward moving disturbances are probably some manifestation of what Neelin describes as an ""SST mode'. A fairly modest change in the mean climate is all that is required to excite eastward moving anomalies in place of the westward moving SST modes found previously. -from Author",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; GCM; interannual variability; mean climate state; ocean/atmosphere coupling; tropical environment; tropical interannual variability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08948755,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029536998
