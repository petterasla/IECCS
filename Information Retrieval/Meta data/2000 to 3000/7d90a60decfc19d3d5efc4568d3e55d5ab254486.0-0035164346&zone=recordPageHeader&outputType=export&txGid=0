Earlier work demonstrated a 2-3°C increase in both summer and winter temperatures at Sevilleta over this time period. In that study, Neotoma albigula's adult mean body mass decreased as temperature increased. Dipodomys merriami's adult mean body mass differed significantly among years for both sexes but there was no trend across years. There was also no relationship to climate variables. Abundance showed a positive relationship with one axis of a PCA of the correlated climate variables. © 2001 Academic Press.","Bergmann's Rule; Body size; Dipodomys merriami; Global warming; Kangaroo rat; Neotoma albigula; Sevilleta; Woodrat","Bergmann Rule; body size; climate change; rodent; United States",,,,,,"Baumgardner, G.D., Geographic patterns of size and correlation with selected abiotic variables (1989) Morphologic variation in kangaroo rats (genus Dipodomys), pp. 46-92. , Ph.D. dissertation, Memphis State University. 469 pp; Baumgardner, G.D., Kennedy, M.L., Morphometric variation in kangaroo rats (genus Dipodomys) and its relationship to selected abiotic variables (1993) Journal of Mammalogy, 74, pp. 69-85; Brown, J.H., Adaptation to environmental temperature in two species of woodrats, Neotoma cinerea and Neotoma albigula (1968) Miscellaneous Publications of the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, 135, pp. 1-48; Brown, J.H., Heske, E.J., Control of a desert-grassland transition by a keystone rodent guild (1990) Science, 250, pp. 1705-1707; Brown, J.H., Kurzius, M.A., Composition of desert rodent faunas: Combinations of coexisting species (1987) Annales Zoology.
