With the former, it is customary to use Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for making tradeoffs among greenhouse gases. A number of studies have shown the arbitrariness of this approach and have argued that tradeoffs should be based on the contribution of each gas to achieving a particular target. Focusing on radiative forcing bypasses the need to rely on GWPs andprovidesfor tradeoffs among gases based on their relative value. Copyright © 2006 by the IAEE.
