Many strategies to reduce emissions are targeting the methanogens that inhabit the rumen, but such an approach can only be successful if it targets all the major groups of ruminant methanogens. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the diversity of these microbes in different breeds of cattle and sheep, as well as in response to different diets, is required. A study was undertaken using the molecular techniques denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DNA cloning and DNA sequence analysis to define the extent of diversity among methanogens in ruminants, particularly Bos indicus cross cattle, on differing forages in Queensland. It was found that the diversity of methanogens in forage-fed cattle in Queensland was greater than in grain-fed cattle but there was little variability in methanogen community composition between cattle fed different forages. The species that dominate the rumen microbial communities of B. indicus cross cattle are from the genus Methanobrevibacter, although rumen-fluid inoculated digestors fed Leucaena leucocephala leaf were populated with Methanosphaera-like strains, with the Methanobrevibacter-like strains displaced. If ruminant methane emissions are to be reduced, then antimethanogen bioactives that target both broad groups of ruminant methanogens are most likely to be needed, and as a part of an integrated suite of approaches that redirect rumen fermentation towards other more useful end products. © CSIRO 2008.","Archaea; Pasture","cattle; community composition; fermentation; global warming; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; ruminant; species diversity; Australasia; Australia; Queensland; Animalia; Archaea; Bos; Bos indicus; Bovidae; Leucaena leucocephala; Methanobrevibacter; Methanosphaera; Ovis aries",,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) Journal of Molecular Biology, 215, pp. 403-410; Amann, R.I., Ludwig, W., Schleifer, K.H., Phylogenetic identification and in situ detection of individual microbial cells without cultivation (1995) Microbiological Reviews, 59, pp. 143-169; Barns, S.M., Fundyga, R.E., Jeffries, M.W., Remarkable archaeal diversity detected in a Yellowstone national park hot spring environment (1994) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 91, pp. 1609-1613. , doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1609; Fricke, W.F., Seedorf, H., Henne, A., Kruer, M., Liesegang, H., Hedderich, R., Gottschalk, G., Thauer, R.K., The genome sequence of Methanosphaera stadtmanae reveals why this human intestinal archaeon is restricted to methanol and H2 for methane formation and ATP synthesis (2006) Journal of Bacteriology, 188, pp. 642-658. , doi: 10.1128/JB.188.2.642-658.2006; Joblin, K.N., Ruminal acetogens and their potential to lower ruminant methane emissions (1999) Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 50, pp. 1307-1313. , doi: 10.1071/AR99004; Klieve, A.V., Holroyd, R.G., Turner, A.F., Lindsay, J.A., Rumen bacterial and protozoal populations in cattle being relocated in tropical Queensland (1998) Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 49, pp. 1153-1159. , doi: 10.1071/A97164; Klieve, A.V., Hennessey, D., Ouwerkerk, D., Forster, R.J., Mackie, R.I., Attwood, G.T., Establishing populations of Megasphaera elsdenii YE 34 and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens YE 44 in the rumen of cattle fed high grain diets (2003) Journal of Applied Microbiology, 95, pp. 621-630. , doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2672.2003.02024.x; Klieve, A.V., O'Leary, M.N., McMillen, L., Ouwerkerk, D., Ruminococcus bromii, identification and isolation as a dominant community member in the rumen of cattle fed a barley diet (2007) Journal of Applied Microbiology, 103, pp. 2065-2073. , doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03492.x; Kocherginskaya, S.A., Cann, I.K.O., Mackie, R.I., Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (2005) Methods in gut microbial ecology for ruminants, pp. 119-128. , Eds HPS Makkar, CS McSweeny pp, International Atomic Energy Agency, Springer Academic Press: Amsterdam; NGGIC (2007) 'National greenhouse gas inventory 2005 with methodology supplement.'
