The annual rise in lake level is held for an extended duration at a regulated ""full pool' level which is approximately 3 m above its natural base elevation. The total time for a complete cycle of lake level change also has been increased from 100 days to over 300 days. Alteration of the natural lake level fluctuation has resulted in a transfer of annual wave energy from base elevations corresponding to the pre-dam nearshore shelf, to elevations corresponding to the limnetic foreshore environment, thereby inducing lake-wide erosion. The most extensive erosion has occurred along the low-lying dissipative north shore of the lake. The redistribution of annual wave energy due to regulated lake level fluctuation is the main factor contributing to that erosion. Altering the regulated lake level fluctuation by changing the timing and increasing the rate of lake level drawdown, would result in a significant reduction in the amount of annual wave energy that reaches the eroding full pool shoreline, thereby reducing the potential for lake-wide shoreline erosion. -from Authors",,"lake level; regulation; reservoir; shoreline erosion; wave energy; USA, Montana, Flathead Lake; Erosion; Flathead Lake, Montana, USA; Lakes; Wave Forces",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,07490208,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027789102
