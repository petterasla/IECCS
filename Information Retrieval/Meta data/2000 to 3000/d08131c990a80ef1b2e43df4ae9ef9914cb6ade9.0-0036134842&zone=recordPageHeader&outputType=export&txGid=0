We examined the influence of 6 years of tillage (no-till, NT; chisel plowing, CP; and moldboard plowing, MP), cover crop (hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) vs. winter weeds), and N fertilization (0, 90, and 180kg N ha -1) on soil organic C and N concentrations in a Norfolk sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic, Typic Kandiudults) under tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and silage corn (Zea mays L.). In a second experiment, we compared the effects of 7 years of non-legume (rye (Secale cereale L.)) and legume (hairy vetch and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.)) cover crops and N fertilization (HN (90 kg N ha -1 for tomato and 80 kg N ha -1 for eggplant)) and FN (180 kg N ha -1 for tomato and 160 kg N ha -1 for eggplant)) on soil organic C and N in a Greenville fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic, Rhodic Kandiudults) under tomato and eggplant (Solanum melogena L.). Both experiments were conducted from 1994 to 2000 in Fort Valley, GA. Carbon concentration in cover crops ranged from 704 kg ha -1 in hairy vetch to 3704 kg ha -1 in rye in 1999 and N concentration ranged from 77 kg ha -1 in rye in 1996 to 299 kg ha -1 in crimson clover in 1997. With or without N fertilization, concentrations of soil organic C and N were greater in NT with hairy vetch than in MP with or without hairy vetch (23.5-24.9 vs. 19.9-21.4 Mg ha -1 and 1.92-2.05 vs. 1.58-1.76 Mg ha -1, respectively). Concentrations of organic C and N were also greater with rye, hairy vetch, crimson clover, and FN than with the control without a cover crop or N fertilization (17.5-18.4 vs. 16.5 Mg ha -1 and 1.33-1.43 vs. 1.31 Mg ha -1, respectively). From 1994 to 1999, concentrations of soil organic C and N decreased by 8-16% in NT and 15-25% in CP and MP. From 1994 to 2000, concentrations of organic C and N decreased by 1% with hairy vetch and crimson clover, 2-6% with HN and FN, and 6-18% with the control. With rye, organic C and N increased by 3-4%. Soil organic C and N concentrations can be conserved and/or maintained by reducing their loss through mineralization and erosion, and by sequestering atmospheric CO 2 and N 2 in the soil using NT with cover crops and N fertilization. These changes in soil management improved soil quality and productivity. Non-legume (rye) was better than legumes (hairy vetch and crimson clover) and N fertilization in increasing concentrations of soil organic C and N. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
