Population-based, cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 1202 respondents in Portland OR and Houston TX between June and September 2007 regarding awareness, concern, and behavior change related to climate change. The data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Awareness about climate change is virtually universal (98% in Portland and 92% in Houston) with the vast majority reporting some level of concern (90% in Portland and 82% in Houston). A multivariate analysis revealed significant predictors of behavior change: individuals with heightened concern about climate change (p<0.001); respondents with higher level of education (p= 0.03); younger compared with older individuals (p<0.001); and Portlanders more likely to change behavior compared with Houstonians (p<0.001). Of those who changed behavior, 43% reported having reduced their energy usage at home, 39% had reduced gasoline consumption, and 26% engaged in other behaviors, largely recycling. Qualitative data indicate a number of cognitive, behavioral, and structural obstacles to voluntary mitigation. Although consumers are interested in global climate change-mitigation strategies and willing to act accordingly, considerable impediments remain. Government policy must eliminate economic, structural, and social barriers to change and advance accessible and economical alternatives. Individual-level mitigation can be a policy option under favorable contextual conditions, as these results indicate, but must be accompanied by mitigation efforts from industry, commerce, and government. © 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",,"gasoline; attitude to change; awareness; behavior change; climate change; energy consumption; global change; health survey; perception; policy; recycling; review; United States; Adult; Aged; Awareness; Conservation of Energy Resources; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Oregon; Public Opinion; Social Behavior; Texas",,"gasoline, 86290-81-5",,,,"IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: climate change 2007, , http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/assessments-reports.htm, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Schellenhuber, H.J., Cramer, W., Nakicenovic, N., Wigley, T., Yohe, G., (2006) Avoiding dangerous climate change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; McCarthy, J.J., Canziani, O.F., Leary, N.A., Dokken, D.J., White, K.S., (2001) Climate change 2001: impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; McMichael, A.J., Kovats, R.S., Climate change and climate variability: adaptations to reduce adverse health imacts (2000) Environ Monit Assess, 61, pp. 49-64; Ebi, K.L., Semenza, J.C., Community-based adaptation to the health impacts of climate change (2008) Am J Prev Med, 35, pp. 501-507; Semenza, J.C., Rubin, C.H., Falter, K.H., Heat-related deaths during the July 1995 heat wave in Chicago (1996) N Engl J Med, 335, pp. 84-90; Semenza, J.C., Case studies: improving the macrosocial environment (2007) Macrosocial determinants of population health, , Galea S.
