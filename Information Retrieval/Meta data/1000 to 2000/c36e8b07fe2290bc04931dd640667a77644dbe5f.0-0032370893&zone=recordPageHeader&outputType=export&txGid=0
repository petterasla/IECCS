The hypothesis is formulated on an empirical basis from an analysis of the observed data of the magnetic field of the Sun and of the global land-air temperature anomalies of the Earth, with the assumption that the land area of the Earth can be a good recorder of the solar total irradiance variation in the past. As a result of the assumption within the context of the present hypothesis, it was found that the solar total irradiance increase and the global warming of the Earth from the early 20th century to the present time could be caused by release of heat stored in the solar convection zone in the Maunder Minimum of the 17th century.",,,,,,,,"Howard, R.F., LaBonte, B.J., (1980) Astrophys.
