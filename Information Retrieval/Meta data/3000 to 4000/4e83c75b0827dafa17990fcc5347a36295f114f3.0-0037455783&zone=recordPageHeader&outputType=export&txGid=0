Global climate change could lead to increased variability of sea surface temperatures, through influences on climate systems, e.g. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Field observations in 1999, following a strong ENSO, revealed that corals bleached in winter after unusually cold weather. To explore the basis for these observations, the photosynthetic responses of the coral species Montipora digitata Studer were investigated in a series of temperature and light experiments. Small replicate coral colonies were exposed to ecologically relevant lower temperatures for varying durations and under light regimes that ranged from darkness to full sunlight. Photosynthetic efficiency was analyzed using a pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer (Fo, Fm, Fv/Fm), and chlorophyll a (chl a) content and symbiotic dinoflagellate density were analyzed with spectrophotometry and microscopy, respectively. Cold temperature stress had a negative impact on M. digitata colonies indicated by decreased photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and changes in photosynthetic pigment concentrations. Corals in higher light regimes were more susceptible to cold temperature stress. Moderate cold stress resulted in photoacclimatory responses, but severe cold stress resulted in photodamage, bleaching and increased mortality. Responses to cold temperature stress of M. digitata appeared similar to that observed in corals exposed to warmer than normal temperatures, suggesting a common mechanism. The results of this study suggest that corals and coral reefs may also be impacted by exposure to cold as well as warm temperature extremes as climate change occurs.","Climate change; Cold temperature stress; Coral bleaching; Fv/Fm; Photoinhibition; Photosynthesis; Symbiotic dinoflagellates","climate change; coral bleaching; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; photoinhibition; sea surface temperature; Anthozoa; Dinophyceae; Montipora; Montipora digitata",,,,,,"Ambarsari, I., Brown, B.E., Barlow, R.G., Britton, G., Cummings, D.G., Fluctuations in algal chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments during solar bleaching in the coral Goniastrea aspera at Phuket, Thailand (1997) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 159, pp. 303-307; Aro, E.M., Hundal, T., Carlberg, I., Andersson, B., In vitro studies on light-induced inhibition of photosystem II and D1-protein degradation at low temperatures (1990) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1019, pp. 269-275; Berkelmans, R., Oliver, J.K., Large-scale bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 55-60; Berkelmans, R., Willis, B.L., Seasonal and local spatial patterns in the upper thermal limits of corals on the inshore Central Great Barrier Reef (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 219-228; Björkman, O., Demmig, B., Photon yield of O2 evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics at 77 K among vascular plants of diverse origins (1987) Planta, 170, pp. 489-504; Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching: Causes and consequences (1997) Coral Reefs, 16 (SUPPL.), pp. S129-S138; Brown, B.E., Adaptations of reef corals to physical environmental stress (1997) Adv Mar Biol, 31, pp. 221-229; Brown, B.E., Dunne, R.P., Scoffin, T.P., Le Tissier, M.D.A., Solar damage in intertidal corals (1994) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 105, pp. 219-230; Brown, B.E., Ambarsari, I., Warner, M.E., Fitt, W.K., Dunne, R.P., Gibb, S.W., Cummings, D.G., Diurnal changes in photochemical efficiency and xanthophyll concentrations in shallow water reef corals: Evidence for photoinhibition and photoprotection (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 99-105; Brown, B.E., Dunne, R.P., Goodson, M.S., Douglas, A.E., Marine ecology: Bleaching patterns in reef corals (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 142-143; Bruce, D., Samson, G., Carpenter, C., The origins of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence in photosynthesis (1997) Biochemistry, 36, pp. 749-755; Buss, L.W., Vaisnys, J.R., Temperature stress induces dynamic chaos in a cnidarian gastrovascular system (1993) Proc R Soc Lond Ser B, 252, pp. 39-41; Coles, S.L., Fadlallah, Y.H., Reef coral survival and mortality at low temperatures in the Arabian Gulf: New species-specific lower temperature limits (1991) Coral Reefs, 9, pp. 231-237; Coles, S.L., Jokiel, P.L., Effects of temperature on photosynthesis and respiration in hermatypic corals (1977) Mar Biol, 43, pp. 209-216; Coles, S.L., Jokiel, P.L., Synergistic effects of temperature, salinity and light on the hermatypic coral Montipora verrucosa (1978) Mar Biol, 49, pp. 187-195; Dana, J.D., On the temperature limiting the distribution of corals (1843) Am J Sci, 45, pp. 130-131; Demmig-Adams, B., Carotenoids and photoprotection in plants.
