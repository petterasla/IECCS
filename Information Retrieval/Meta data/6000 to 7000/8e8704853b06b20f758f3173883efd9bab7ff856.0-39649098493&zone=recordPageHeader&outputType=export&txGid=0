However, in order to determine the consequences of such impacts, a holistic, integrated assessment is needed. This paper sets the stage for the remainder of this volume by describing an attempt to derive such an assessment for the Barents Sea Region through the EU-funded BALANCE project. The paper explains some of the major methodologies employed in the study. It also provides insight into major results obtained and attempts to answer a number of overarching questions. It will be shown that climate change does present a significant threat to environmental and societal integrity in the study region. However, it will also be shown that stakeholders regard other drivers of future changes (economical, political developments) at least as equally important for their personal lives. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Environmental impact; Project management; Barents Sea Region; Global climate change; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; environmental impact assessment; global climate; Arctic Ocean; Barents Region; Barents Sea; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe",,,,,,"(2005) Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, p. 1042. , ACIA Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Berlin, K., The use of WebGIS in the EU-project BASIS (1999) Proceedings of Angewandte Geographische Informationsverarbeitung XI, , (in German).
