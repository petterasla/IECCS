In simple correlation, cases of salmonellosis, erysipelas, infectious mononucleosis and toxoplasmosis were positively correlated with the winter NAO index, while hepatitis A and shigellosis were negatively correlated, and the other diseases tested (rubella, mumps, chickenpox, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme borreliosis, leptospirosis, tularemia and scarlet fever) were uncorrelated with NAO. However, 8 of the 14 diseases also revealed a significant time trend, either increasing (infectious mononucleosis, salmonellosis, erysipelas, toxoplasmosis) or decreasing (hepatitis A, scarlet fever, leptospirosis, shigellosis) during the period. When the effect of NAO on incidence of the diseases was then controlled for calendar year using partial correlation analysis and detrended regression, only toxoplasmosis and infectious mononucleosis were found significantly positively correlated with the NAO when the index was lagged 1 or 2 years, and leptospirosis was correlated negatively with a lag of 2 years. Large-scale weather changes as described by NAO therefore do not seem to be a crucial factor in the fluctuation of annual incidence rate of the majority of tested infectious diseases in the Czech Republic, while other factors, especially social and public health circumstances, are obviously more important. © Springer 2005.","Climate change; Cluster analysis; Incidence rate; Large-scale weather; NAO; Temperature; Weather factors","article; Atlantic Ocean; bacterial infection; chickenpox; controlled study; correlation analysis; Czech Republic; environmental factor; erysipelas; hepatitis A; human; incidence; infectious mononucleosis; leptospirosis; Lyme disease; major clinical study; mumps; oscillation; protozoal infection; regression analysis; rubella; salmonellosis; scarlet fever; shigellosis; statistical significance; tick borne encephalitis; toxoplasmosis; tularemia; virus infection; weather; winter; Atlantic Ocean; Climate; Cluster Analysis; Communicable Diseases; Czech Republic; Humans; Incidence; Longitudinal Studies; Temperature; Weather",,,,,,"Loevinsohn, M.E., Climatic warming and increased malaria incidence in Rwanda (1994) Lancet, 343, pp. 714-718; Patz, J.A., Epstein, P.R., Burke, T.A., Balbus, J.M., Global climate change and emerging infectious diseases (1996) J Am Med Assoc, 275, pp. 217-223; Martens, W.J.M., Slooff, R., Jackson, E.K., Climate change, human health, and sustainable development (1997) Bull WHO, 75, pp. 583-588; Colwell, R., Epstein, P., Gubler, D., Global climate change and infectious diseases (1998) Emerg Infect Dis, 4, pp. 451-452; Epstein, P.R., Diaz, H.F., Elias, S., Biological and physical signs of climate change: Focus on mosquito-borne diseases (1998) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 79, pp. 409-417; Mouchet, J., Manguin, S., Sircoulon, J., Laventure, S., Faye, O., Onapa, A.W., Evolution of malaria in Africa for the past 40 years: Impact of climatic and human factors (1998) J Am Mosq Control Assoc, 14, pp. 121-130; Reiter, P., Global warming and vector-borne disease in temperate regions and at high altitude (1998) Lancet, 351, pp. 839-840; Engelthaler, D.M., Mosley, D.G., Cheek, J.E., Climatic and environmental patterns associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Four Corners region, United States (1999) Emerg Infect Dis, 5, pp. 87-94; Lindgren, E., Tälleklint, L., Polfeldt, T., Impact of climatic change on the northern latitude limit and population density of the disease-transmitting European tick Ixodes ricinus (2000) Environ Health Persp, 108, pp. 119-123; Gubler, D.J., Reiter, P., Ebi, K.L., Yap, W., Nasci, R., Patz, J.A., Climate variability and change in the United States: Potential impact on vector- and rodent-borne diseases (2001) Environ Hlth Persp, 109, pp. 223-233. , Suppl 2; Reiter, P., Climate change and mosquito-borne diseases (2001) Environ Health Persp, 109, pp. 141-161. , Suppl 1; Kovats, R.S., Campbell-Lendrum, D.H., McMichael, A.J., Woodward, A., Cox, J.H., Early effects of climate change: Do they include changes in vector-borne disease?
