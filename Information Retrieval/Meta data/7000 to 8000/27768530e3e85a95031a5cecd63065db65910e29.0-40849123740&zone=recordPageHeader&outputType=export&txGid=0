However, the impact of the establishment of hybrid poplar plantations on C and N storage and dynamics is poorly understood. We studied the distribution and temporal changes of C and N in soil organic matter (SOM) density fractions in 2-, 5-, 11-, and 13-year-old (age as in 2006) hybrid poplar stands that form a chronosequence by sampling the plantations in both 2004 and 2006. Sodium polytungstate (SPT, density = 1.6 g mL- 1) was used to fractionate the soil into light (LF, density &lt; 1.6 g mL- 1), occluded light (LFo, density &lt; 1.6 g mL- 1) and heavy fractions (HF density &gt; 1.6 g mL- 1). The results showed that C and N concentrations (g kg- 1 of fraction) in the SOM density fractions decreased in the order of LFo &gt; LF &gt; HF, while the C/N ratio was in the order of LF &gt; LFo &gt; HF. The amount of C and N stored in the LF, LFo and HF fractions and bulk soil in the top 10 cm of soil was: 149-504, 70-336, 1380-2876 and 1617-3776 g m- 2, respectively, for C, and 6-26, 3-20, 149-271 and 152-299 g m- 2, respectively, for N. From 2004 to 2006, C and N storage decreased in the LF and LFo fractions but increased in the HF fraction in the youngest stand. However, stand-age effects were likely muted by high inherent soil variability among the stands. Carbon storage in the light fraction was responsive in the short term to hybrid poplar plantation establishment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
