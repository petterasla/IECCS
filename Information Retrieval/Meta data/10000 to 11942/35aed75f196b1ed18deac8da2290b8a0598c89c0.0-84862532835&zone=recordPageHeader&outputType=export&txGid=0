Adjustment between reproductive phenology and environment is expected to be higher in arctic and alpine habitats because the growing season is considerably short. As early- and late-flowering species reproduce under very different environmental conditions, selective pressures on flowering phenology and potential effects of climate change are likely to differ between them. However, there is no agreement on the magnitude of the benefits and costs of early- vs. late-flowering species under a global warming scenario. In spite of its relevance, phenotypic selection on flowering phenology has rarely been explored in alpine plants and never in Mediterranean high mountain species, where selective pressures are very different due to the summer drought imposed over the short growth season. We hypothesized that late-flowering plants in Mediterranean mountains should present stronger selective pressures towards early onset of reproduction than early-flowering species, because less water is available in the soil as growing season progresses. We performed selection analyses on flowering onset and duration in two high mountain species of contrasting phenology. Since phenotypic selection can be highly context-dependent, we studied several populations of each species for 2 years, covering their local altitudinal ranges and their different microhabitats. Surrogates of biotic selective agents, like fruitset for pollinators and flower and fruit loss for flower and seed predators, were included in the analysis. Differences between the early- and the late-flowering species were less than expected. A consistent negative correlational selection of flowering onset and duration was found affecting plant fitness, i.e., plants that bloomed earlier flowered for longer periods improving plant fitness. Nevertheless, the late-flowering species may experience higher risks under climate warming because in extremely warm and dry years the earlier season does not bring about a longer flowering duration due to summer drought. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Alpine plants; Altitudinal gradients; Flowering phenology; Phenotypic selection",,,,,,,"Alatalo, J.M., Totland, Ø., Response to simulated climatic change in an alpine and subarctic pollen-risk strategist, Silene acaulis (2003) Glob Change Biol, 3, pp. 74-79; Albert, M.J., Iriondo, J.M., Escudero, A., Dissecting components of flowering pattern: Size effects on female fitness (2008) Bot J Linn Soc, 156, pp. 227-236; Arbuckle, J., (2003) Amos 5 User's Guide Supplement, , AMOS Development Corporation, Spring House, PA; Arnold, S.J., Wade, M.J., On the measurement of natural and sexual selection: Applications (1984) Evolution, 38, pp. 720-734; Arnold, S.J., Wade, M.J., On the measurement of natural and sexual selection: Theory (1984) Evolution, 38, pp. 709-719; Beniston, M., Diaz, H.F., Bradley, R.S., Climatic change at high elevation sites: An overview (1997) Clim Change, 36, pp. 233-251; Bradshaw, W.E., Holzapfel, C.M., Evolutionary response to rapid climate change (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1477-1478; Brody, A.K., Effects of pollinators, herbivores and seed predators on flowering phenology (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1624-1631; Burgess, K.S., Etterson, J.R., Galloway, L.F., Artificial selection shifts flowering phenology and other correlated traits in an autotetraploid herb (2007) Heredity, 99, pp. 641-648; Conner, J.K., Understanding natural selection: An approach integrating selection gradients, multiplicative fitness components, and path analysis (1996) Ethol Ecol Evol, 8, pp. 387-397; Donnison, I.S., Francis, D., Experimental control of floral reversion in isolated shoot apices of the longday plant Silene coeli-rosa (1994) Physiol Plant, 92, pp. 329-335; Donohue, K., Niche construction through phenological plasticity: Life history dynamics and ecological consequences (2005) New Phytol, 166, pp. 83-92; Dunne, J.A., Harte, J., Taylor, K.J., Subalpine meadow flowering phenology responses to climate change: Integrating experimental and gradient methods (2003) Ecol Monogr, 73, pp. 69-86; Dye, D.G., Variability and trends in the annual snow cover cycle in Northern Hemisphere land areas, 1972-2000 (2002) Hydrol Proc, 16, pp. 3065-3077; Ehrlén, J., Munzbergová, Z., Timing of flowering: Opposed selection on different fitness components and trait covariation (2009) Am Nat, 173, pp. 819-830; Elzinga, J.A., Atlan, A., Biere, A., Time after time: Flowering phenology and biotic interactions (2007) Trends Ecol Evol, 22, pp. 432-439; Galen, C., Stanton, M.L., Short-term responses of alpine buttercups to experimental manipulations of growing season length (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 1052-1058; Galen, C., Stanton, M.L., Responses of snowbed plant species to changes in growing season length (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 1546-1557; García-Camacho, R., Escudero, A., Reproduction of an early-flowering Mediterranean mountain narrow endemic (Armeria caespitosa) in a contracting mountain island (2009) Plant Biol, 11, pp. 515-525; García-Camacho, R., Méndez, M., Escudero, A., Pollination context effects in the high-mountain dimorphic Armeria caespitosa (Plumbaginaceae): Neighborhood is something more than density (2009) Am J Bot, 96, pp. 1620-1626; Giménez-Benavides, L., Dotterl, S., Jurgens, A., Generalist diurnal pollination provides greater fitness in a plant with nocturnal pollination syndrome: Assessing the effects of a Silene-Hadena interaction (2007) Oikos, 116, pp. 1461-1472; Giménez-Benavides, L., Escudero, A., Iriondo, J.M., Reproductive limits of a late-flowering highmountain Mediterranean plant along an elevational climate gradient (2007) New Phytol, 173, pp. 367-382; Giménez-Benavides, L., Escudero, A., Iriondo, J.M., Local adaptation enhances seedling recruitment along an altitudinal gradient in a high mountain Mediterranean plant (2007) Ann Bot, 99, pp. 723-734; Giménez-Benavides, L., Escudero, A., Iriondo, J.M., What shapes the altitudinal range of a high mountain Mediterranean plant?
