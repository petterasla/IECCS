Measured radiocarbon dates from the sapropel and clams require corrections of 785 ± 80 and 365 ± 90 14C yr (1σ), respectively, in order to achieve consistency with the radiocarbon time scale. Lake sediments of the US Gulf Coast serve as unique repositories of pre-historic hurricane strikes. Previously unrecognized radiocarbon deficiencies likely render compromised chronologies of the paleo-hurricane records, and erroneous estimates of return period and landfall probability that are derived from the storm chronologies. The recalculated severe hurricane chronologies suggest that the annual landfall probabilities of the last millennium on the US Gulf Coast are equal to, or higher than, the preceding three millennia. © 2009 University of Washington.","Coastal lakes; Corrected dates; Global warming; Gulf of Mexico; Landfall probability; Limnic sapropel; Paleo-hurricanes; Radiocarbon deficiencies; Return period; US Gulf Coast","chronology; global warming; lacustrine deposit; measurement method; radiocarbon dating; sapropel; Gulf Coast [United States]; North America; United States; Bivalvia; Rangia cuneata",,,,,,"Abbott, M.B., Stafford, T.W., Radiocarbon geochemistry of modern and ancient Arctic lake systems, Baffin Island, Canada (1996) Quaternary Research, 45, pp. 300-311; Andrus, C.F.T., Rich, K.W., A preliminary assessment of oxygen isotope fractionation and growth increment periodicity in the estuarine clam Rangia cuneata (2008) Geo-Marine Letters, 28, pp. 301-308; Aten, L.E., (1983) Indians of the Upper Texas Coast, p. 370. , Academic Press, New York; Broecker, W., Radiocarbon dating: a case against the proposed link between river mollusks and soil humus (1964) Science, 143, pp. 596-597; Culleton, B.J., Implications of a freshwater radiocarbon reservoir correction for the timing of late Holocene settlement of the Elk Hills, Kern County, California (2006) Journal of Archeological Science, 33, pp. 1331-1339; Deevey, E.S., Stuiver, M., Distribution of natural isotopes of carbon in Linsley Pond and other New England lakes (1964) Limnology and Oceanography, 9, pp. 1-11; Elsner, J.B., Tempests in time (2007) Nature, 447, pp. 647-649; Elsner, J.B., Liu, K.-b., Kocher, B., Spatial variations in major hurricane activity: statistics and physical mechanism (2000) Journal of Climate, 13, pp. 2293-2305; Elsner, J.B., Jagger, T.H., Liu, K.-b., Comparison of hurricane return levels using historical and geological records (2008) Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, 47, pp. 368-374; Gillikin, D.P., Lorrain, A., Bouillon, P.W., Willenz, P., Dehairs, F., Stable carbon isotopic composition of Mytilus edulis shells: relation to metabolism, salinity, δ13CDIC and phytoplankton (2006) Organic Geochemistry, 37, pp. 1371-1382; Hopkins, S.H., Andrews, J.D., Rangia cuneata on the East Coast: thousand mile extension or resurgence?
