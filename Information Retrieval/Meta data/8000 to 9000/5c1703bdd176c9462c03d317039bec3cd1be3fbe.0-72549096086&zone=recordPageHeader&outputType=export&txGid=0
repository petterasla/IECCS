Most GHG reporting initiatives around the world utilize two metrics proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): radiative forcing (RF) and global warming potential (GWP). This paper provides a general introduction of the factors that define a GHG and explains the scientific background for estimating RF and GWP, thereby exposing the lay reader to a brief overview of the methods for calculating the effects of GHGs on climate change. An objective of this paper is to increase awareness that the GWP of GHGs has been re-adjusted as the concentration and relative proportion of these GHGs has changed with time (e.g., the GWP of methane has changed from 21 to 25 CO 2-eq). Improved understanding of the indirect effects of GHGs has also led to a modification in the methodology for calculating GWP. Following a presentation of theory behind GHG, RF and GWP concepts, the paper briefly describes the most important GHG sources and sinks in the context of the waste management industry. The paper serves as a primer for more detailed research publications presented in this special issue of Waste Management &amp; Research providing a technology-based assessment of quantitative GHG emissions from different waste management technologies.","Gas emissions; Global warming potential; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Radiative forcing; Waste management","GHG emission; Global warming potential; Indirect effects; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Post-consumer; Radiative forcing; Radiative forcings; Technology-based; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Methane; Solid wastes; Waste management; methane; carbon sink; climate change; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; radiative forcing; waste management; waste technology; air pollution control; anaerobic digestion; climate change; composting; energy consumption; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; global warming potential; greenhouse gas; incineration; landfill; mathematical analysis; priority journal; process technology; quantitative analysis; radiative forcing; recycling; review; waste management; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Sunlight; Waste Management",,"methane, 74-82-8; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Bertelsen, M., Fenger, J., (2005) Naturens Kemi, , 1st edition.
