Group-wide activities to rise eco-efficiency are focussed on manufacturing processes rather than on product design, since chemical composition and structure of the Roche pharmaceutical products are defined by the desired therapeutic effect, in contrast to commodities. Three examples of currently operating eco-efficient processes at Roche are described. They cover main areas for further improvement of both environmental performance and economical benefit: less material intensity and waste for disposal, energy recovery, minimization of water consumption. Furthermore, four different indicators currently used at Roche to track environmental performance and eco-efficiency are presented: the Roche Environmental Impact Figure (REIF), the Roche Energy Rate (RER), the Roche contribution to man-made global warming (CO2 equivalents), and the Eco-Efficiency Rate (EER). These key indicators are used as a basis to recognize weaknesses and strengths, to take decisions for improvement, to set environmental targets, and as management information.",,,,,,,,"(1990) Information on Ozone-depleting Substances, , Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, Forest and Landscape; Schaltegger, S., Sturm, A., (1994) Ökologieorientierte Entscheidungen im Unternehmen, , Institute of Business Management, University of Basel","Glauser, M.; Corp.
