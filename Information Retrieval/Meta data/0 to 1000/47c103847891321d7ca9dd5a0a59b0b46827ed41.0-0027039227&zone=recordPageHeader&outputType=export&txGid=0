Cost-effectiveness is a key measure for comparing a broad range of options to mitigate the effects of greenhouse warming. Although the full cost of many mitigation measures is difficult to assess, analysis suggests that a variety of energy efficiency and other measures that are now available could reduce US emissions of greenhouse gases by roughly 10 to 40% of current levels at relatively low cost, perhaps at a net cost savings. Such measures are proposed as an initial US response to global warming concerns in conjunction with other domestic and international efforts. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide; climatic change; cost-effectiveness; emission reduction; global warming; greenhouse gas; man-environment relations; mitigation measure; policy response; USA; policy; priority journal; short survey; thermal pollution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027039227
