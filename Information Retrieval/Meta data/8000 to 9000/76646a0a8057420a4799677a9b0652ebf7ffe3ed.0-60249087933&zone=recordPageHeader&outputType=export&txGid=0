To address this substantial knowledge gap, we identified nine FMSW and fifteen paired upland forest sites across three bioregions in North America (sub-alpine in Colorado; north-temperate in Minnesota; and south-temperate in South Carolina) to test the following three hypotheses. First, FMSW store a higher proportion of active SOC compared with upland systems because long anaerobic periods favor the accumulation of labile substrates. Second, in FMSW, SOC quality decreases from cold to warm bioregions because high quality detritus accumulates preferentially at cool sites where decomposition is slow. Finally, decomposition of SOC in FMSW will respond more strongly to warming under aerobic conditions than SOC from upland forest soils because of higher accumulation of active SOC in FMSW. To test these hypotheses, we incubated FMSW and upland forest soils at two constant temperatures (10 and 30 °C) for 525-d under aerobic conditions and constant moisture. In contrast to our first hypothesis, we observed similarly rapid depletion of active SOC compounds at initial stages of incubation across FMSW and upland sites, and across the 525-d incubations we observed overall lower SOC decomposition rates in our FMSW soils. In line with our second hypothesis, and across FMWS and upland soils, we found greater SOC loss in the sub-alpine bioregion than both temperate regions. In contrast to our last hypothesis, we found no difference in the temperature sensitivity (Q10) of SOC decomposition in FMSW and upland forest soils. Critically, total SOC loss (g SOC per g soil) was larger in FMSW because of the large amount of SOC stored in these ecosystems, indicating that despite a lack of difference between FMSW and upland responses, the total release of C from FMSW that could result from global warming may be large. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","Forested mineral soil wetlands; Global warming; Long-term incubation; Q10; SOC quality; Sub-alpine forests; Temperate forests","Biological materials; Fault detection; Fire hazards; Global warming; Landforms; Mineralogy; Minerals; Mining; Organic carbon; Silica; Silicate minerals; Soils; Wetlands; Forested mineral soil wetlands; Long-term incubation; Q<sub>10</sub>; SOC quality; Sub-alpine forests; Temperate forests; Programmable logic controllers; annual variation; decomposition; forest soil; incubation; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil temperature; subalpine environment; temperate forest; warming; wetland; Minnesota; North America; United States",,,,,,"Ågren, G.I., Bosatta, E., Quality: a bridge between theory and experiment in soil organic matter studies (1996) Oikos, 76, pp. 522-528; Amacher, M.C., Unbuffered and buffered salt methods for exchangeable cations and effective cation-exchange capacity (1990) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 54, pp. 1036-1042; Anselman, I., Crutzen, P.J., Global distribution of natural freshwater wetlands and rice paddies, their net primary productivity, seasonality and possible methane emissions (1989) Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry, 8, pp. 307-359; Baker, T.T., Conner, W.H., Lockaby, B.G., Stanturf, J.A., Burke, M.K., Fine root productivity and dynamics on a forested floodplain in South Carolina (2001) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 65, pp. 545-556; Billings, W.D., Luken, J.O., Mortensen, D.A., Petersen, K.M., Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide: possible effects on arctic tundra (1983) Oecologia, 58, pp. 286-289; Bridgham, S.D., Megonigal, J.P., Keller, J.K., Bliss, N.B., Trettin, C., The carbon balance of North American wetlands (2006) Wetlands, 26, pp. 889-916; Campbell, C., Vitt, D.H., Halsey, L.A., Campbell, I.D., Thormann, M.N., Bayley, S.E., (2000) Net Primary Production and Standing Biomass in Northern Continental Wetlands.
