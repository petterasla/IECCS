Results show that the mean annual historical rainfall and runoff, averaged over the entire region, are 516 and 55 mm, respectively. There is considerable uncertainty in the global climate modelling (GCM) of rainfall response in the region to global warming. The majority of GCMs show a decrease in the mean annual rainfall and the median estimate indicates that future mean annual runoff in the region in 2030 relative to 1990 will be lower by 0-20% in the southern parts, no change to a slight reduction in the eastern parts and higher by 0-20% in the northwest corner. Averaged across the entire region, the median estimate is a 5% decrease in the mean annual runoff and the extreme estimates range from a 14% decrease to a 10% increase in mean annual runoff. This is the first comprehensive study on the hydrological impacts of climate change done in NSW that covers the entire state. Outputs from this study are being used to underpin the hydrology for a number of major climate change impact studies that are presently underway across NSW. The results and output datasets from this study will be available through a web interface and they can be used by all state government agencies and industries in NSW to plan for and adapt to the impacts of climate change © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Climate change; Climate change impact on runoff; Rainfall-runoff modelling","Annual rainfall; Annual runoff; Climate change impact; Comprehensive studies; Data sets; Future climate; Global climates; Hydrological impacts; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; New South Wales; New South Wales , Australia; Rainfall-runoff modelling; State government agencies; Web interface; Estimation; Global warming; Rain; Runoff; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; extreme event; global warming; hydrological response; rainfall-runoff modeling; Australia; New South Wales",,,,,,"(2007), Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO.
