The current atmospheric CH4 budget, however, does not take into account geologically-sourced CH4 seepage. Geological sources of CH4 include natural macro- and micro-seeps, mud volcanoes, and other miscellaneous sources such as gas hydrates, magmatic volcanoes, geothermal regions, and mid-ocean ridges. Macro-seeps contribute ∼25 Tg (teragrams) CH4/yr to the atmosphere, whereas, micro-seepage contributes perhaps 7 Tg CH4/yr. Mud volcanoes emit ∼5 Tg CH4/yr, and miscellaneous sources emit ∼8 Tg CH4/yr to the atmosphere. Thus, the total contribution to the atmosphere from geological sources is estimated to be 45 Tg CH4/yr, which is significant to the atmospheric organic carbon cycle and should be included in any global inventory of atmospheric CH4. We argue that the atmospheric CH4 global inventory of the Interplanetary Panel on Climate Change must be adjusted in order to incorporate geologically-sourced CH4 from naturally occurring seepage.","Carbon cycle; Global inventory; Methane; Seeps","Global climate change; Greenhouse gases; Magmatic volcanoes; Organic carbon cycle; Carbon; Earth atmosphere; Gas hydrates; Geology; Geothermal fields; Greenhouse effect; Seepage; Volcanoes; Methane; global climate; methane",,,,,,"Aliyev, Ad.A., Guliyev, I.S., Belov, I.S., (2002) Catalogue of Recorded Eruptions of Mud Volcanoes of Azerbaijan, p. 87. , Baku, Azerbaijan: Nafta-Press.
