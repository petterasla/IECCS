Dielectric films consisting of plasma enhanced chemically vapor deposited silicon dioxide and silicon nitride were comparatively etched in CF3I and C2F6/O2 plasma environments. The etch rate of these films was ascertained as a function of applied rf power, etchant gas flow rate, reaction chamber pressure and CF3I:O2 ratio. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","CF3I; CVD chamber cleaning; Dielectric etching; Non-global-warming gas; Perfluorinated compounds; Trifluoromethane; Wafer patterning","Chemical vapor deposition; Fluorine compounds; Plasma etching; Silica; Silicon nitride; Non global warming gases; Perfluorinated compounds; Trifluoroiodomethane; Wafer patterning; Dielectric films",,,,,,"(1995) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: The 1995 Report of the Scientific Assessment Working Group of the IPCC; Ravishankara, A.R., Solomon, S., Turnipseed, A.A., Warren, R.F., (1993) Science, 259, p. 196; Maroulis, P., Langan, J., Johnson, A., Ridgeway, R., Withers, H., (1994) Semicond.
