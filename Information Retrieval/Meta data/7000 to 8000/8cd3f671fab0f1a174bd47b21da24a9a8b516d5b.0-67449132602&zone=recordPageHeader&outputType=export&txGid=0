Although many air pollution control options are available, little is known about the overall environmental impacts of implementing each option. Therefore, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to compare energy and raw material inputs, air emissions, and environmental impacts associated with construction and operation of two air pollution control systems: regenerative thermal oxidation (RTO) with wet scrubbing and photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) with biofiltration. Results: LCA results indicated that environmental impacts to resource depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, and acidification were 20% higher for the use of a RTO-scrubber than for the PCO-biofilter. In addition, at least 25% of the RTO impacts were due to infrastructure requirements. However, the PCO-biofilter system was responsible for more environmental impact in categories of global warming and human toxicity, because of the packing materials required and the electricity use for the PCO reactor. Conclusions: The PCO-biofilter system could be a promising, environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional RTO devices, provided that this system is modified to decrease resource and energy demands. © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.","Air pollution; Biofiltration; Life cycle assessment; Photocatalytic oxidation; Pulp and paper; Thermal oxidation","Air emissions; Consumer Goods; Electricity use; Energy demands; Environmentally-friendly; Forest-products industry; Hazardous air pollutants; Human toxicity; Life cycle assessment; Life-cycle assessments; Packing materials; Photocatalytic oxidation; Photocatalytic oxidations; Photochemical oxidants; Pulp and paper; Pulp and paper mill; Regenerative thermal oxidations; Resource depletion; Thermal oxidation; Wet scrubbing; Air quality; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Environmental impact; Global warming; Hazardous materials; Industrial chemicals; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Oxidation; Paper; Paper and pulp mills; Photocatalysis; Pollution induced corrosion; Pulp; Raw materials; Regenerators; Scrubbers; Spray guns; Thermal pollution; Wood chemicals; Air pollution control; oxidizing agent; acidification; air pollutant; air pollution control; article; biofilter; biofiltration; controlled study; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; paper industry; photocatalysis; photooxidation; pulp mill; Air Pollution; Air Quality; Filtration; Life Cycle; Oxidation; Pollution Control; Pulp Mills; Raw Materials; Toxicity; Wood Products",,,,,,"(1998) 40 CFR Part 63: National emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for source category: pulp and paper production; effluent limitations guidelines, pretreatment standards, and new source performance standards: pulp, 63 (72). , US Environmental Protection Agency US EPA, paper, and paperboard category.
