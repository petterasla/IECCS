Such sails are seen as providing a worthwhile reduction in the delivered power to the propeller and hence the engine generated thrust, with a corresponding reduction in the CO2 production of diesel engine exhaust. In this paper, wind tunnel testing is used to investigate sail-sail interaction effects for two sets of four identical hybrid-sails, and the sail-hull interaction effects for the same two sets of four identical sails in the presence of a bulk carrier hullform. The analysis presented suggests that to build a sail-assisted ship requires an appreciation of the sail-sail and sail-hull interaction effects. © SNAJ 2005.","Aerodynamic sail characteristics; Global warming control; Sail-assisted ship; Sail-sail and sail-hullform interaction; Wind tunnel experiments","Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Docks; Global warming; Hulls (ship); Propellers; Rigidity; Aerodynamic sail characteristics; Global warming control; Sail-assisted ships; Sail-sail and sail-hullform interaction; Wind tunnel experiments; Aerodynamics",,,,,,"Ishihara, M., Watanabe, T., Shimizu, K., Prospect of sail-equipped motor ship as assessed from experimental ship Daioh (1980) Proceedings of the Shipboard Energy Conservation Symposium, pp. 181-198. , Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers; Matsumoto, N., Inoue, M., Sudo, M., Operating performance of a sail-equipped tanker in wave and wind (1982) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference of Stability of Ships and Ocean Vehicles, STAB'82, pp. 451-464. , Tokyo; Hamada, N., (1986) Experimental Study of Performance on Modern Sail-equipped Merchant Ship (in Japanese), , Doctoral thesis No. 7130, Osaka University, Japan; International voyage sail-equipped bulk carrier Usuki Pioneer (1985) Funenokagaku, 38, pp. 36-43; Rosander, M., Bloch, J.O.V., (2000) Modern Windships Phase 2, , http://www.mst.dk/udgiv/publications/2000)/87-7944-019-3/html/ default_eng.htm, Danish Environmental Protection Agency; Nojiri, T., Sano, K., Yagi, M., Hybrid sail developed to show maximum lift coefficient of 2.42 for large vessels Reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 gas emissions expected (2003) Mitsui Zosen Tech Rev, 178, pp. 132-138; Fujiwara, T., Hirata, K., Ueno, M., Nimura, T., On the aerodynamic characteristics of a hybrid-sail with a square soft sail (2003) Proceedings of the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineering, ISOPE2003, pp. 326-333. , Hawaii; Fujiwara, T., Hirata, K., Ueno, M., Nimura, T., On the development of high-performance sails for an ocean-going sailing ship (2003) Proceedings of the International Conference on Marine Simulation and Ship Manocuvrability, MARSIM'03, pp. RC23-129. , Kanazawa; Minami, Y., Nimura, T., Fujiwara, T., Ueno, M., Investigation into underwater fin arrangement effect on steady sailing characteristics of a sail-assisted ship (2003) Proceedings of the International Society of Offshore and Polar Eng, ISOPE2003, pp. 318-325. , Hawaii; Minami, Y., Nimura, T., Fujiwara, T., Ueno, M., Comparison of underwater fin arrangement effect on performances of a sail-assisted merchant ship in North Pacific seaways (2003) Proceedings of the International Conference on Marine Simulation and Ship Manocuvrability, MARSIM'03, pp. RB8-18. , Kanazawa; (2000) World Feels Statistics, , Lloyd's Register; Wagner, B., Wind kanal versuche für einen sechsmastigen segler nach prölss (1967) Universität Hamburg, Bericht Nr. 173.1, , Institut für Schiffbau der; Bradbury, W.M.S., An investigation of graduated trim for an aerofoil rig (1980) Trans Rl Inst Nav Archit, 12, pp. 159-171","Fujiwara, T.; National Maritime Research Institute (NMRI), 6-38-1 Shinkawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0004, Japan; email: fujiwara@nmri.go.jp",,,,,,,,09484280,,,,"English","J.
