Water temperatures in Arctic marine areas are simultaneously increasing as a result of global warming. Potential effects of a combination of increased water temperature and exposure to the PAH pyrene were investigated on fecal pellet and, egg production and hatching success of two copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus and Calanus glacialis, sampled in Disko Bay, Greenland on 23-25 April 2008. The two species were exposed daily to nominal pyrene concentrations of 0-0.01-0.1-1-10-100 nM at water temperatures of 0.5, 5 and 8°C for 9 and 7 days, respectively. Daily measurements of faecal pellet production, egg production and hatching showed different responses of the two species to the applied stressors. When temperature increased, low concentrations of pyrene caused a decrease in faecal pellet production by C. finmarchicus, whereas C. glacialis faecal pellet production showed no negative response to pyrene exposure when temperatures increased. Pyrene exposure decreased egg production of C. finmarchicus at all temperatures, but the species was more sensitive at 0.5 and 8°C. A lag period of 1 day before egg production began was prolonged with several days when warmer water was combined with pyrene exposure. Egg production by C. glacialis was only negatively affected by pyrene in a dose-dependent manner at 0.5°C. Hatching success in both species was not affected by pyrene, where increased water temperatures led to a higher hatching success. In conclusion, C. glacialis seemed to be the less sensitive of the two species to the stress combination of increased water temperature and pyrene exposure. As a consequence of the differential responses of the two species, their competition can be impaired with a consequent impact on energy transfer between trophic levels. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"dose-response relationship; egg production; energy budget; fecal pellet; global warming; hatching; oil spill; pollution exposure; pyrene; reproductive success; sublethal effect; water temperature; zooplankton; Arctic; Disko Bay; Greenland; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus glacialis; Copepoda",,,,,,"(2005) Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , ACIA (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Arctic oil and gas 2007 (2007) Arctic monitoring and assessment programme, Oslo, pp. xiii+40. , AMAP; Arendt, K.E., Nielsen, T.G., Rysgaard, S., Tönnesson, K., Differences in plankton community structure along the Godthåbsfjord, from the Greenland Ice Sheet to offshore waters (2010) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 401, pp. 49-62; Barata, C., Calbet, A., Saiz, E., Ortiz, L., Bayona, J.M., Predicting single and mixture toxicity of petrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to the copepod Oithona davisae (2005) Environ Toxicol Chem, 24 (11), pp. 2992-2999; Bellas, J., Thor, P., Effects of selected PAHs on reproduction and survival of the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa (2007) Ecotoxicol, 16, pp. 465-474; Berrojalbiz, N., Lacorte, S., Calbet, A., Saiz, E., Barata, C., Dachs, J., Accumulation and cycling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in zooplankton (2009) Environ Sci Technol, 43 (7), pp. 2295-2301; Bignert, A., Cossa, D., Emmerson, R., Fryer, R., (2004) OSPAR/ICES workshop on the evaluation and update of background reference concentrations (B/RCs) and ecotoxicological assessment criteria (EACs) and how these assessment tools should be used in assessing contaminants in water, sediment, and biota, , Workshop, The Hague, 9-13 February 2004.
