It treats the atmosphere as a blanket, the effective thermal conductivity of which is a decreasing function of the amount of CO2 present, and does not involve the details of energy transport. The only data required are the CO2 concentrations at the middle of the nineteenth and the end of the twentieth centuries, and the shift in temperature that has occurred over that time. This elementary, phenomenological energy-balance approach is well suited for undergraduate physics courses to illustrate thermal conduction and radiation, by way of the very interesting and critically important example of greenhouse warming of Earth. © 1999 American Association of Physics Teachers.",,,,,,,,"Houghton, J.T., Meria, L.G., Callander, B.A., Harris, N., Kattenberg, A., Maskell, K., Intergovernmental panel on climate change (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Cambridge U.P., Cambridge, UK; Houghton, J.T., (1996) Global Warming: The Complete Briefing, , Cambridge U.P., Cambridge, UK, 2nd ed; Graedel, T.E., Crutzen, P.J., (1997) Atmosphere, Climate, and Change, , Scientific American Library, New York; Adams, J.M., Faure, H., A new estimate of changing carbon storage on land since the last glacial maximum, based on global land ecosystem reconstruction (1998) Global Planet.
