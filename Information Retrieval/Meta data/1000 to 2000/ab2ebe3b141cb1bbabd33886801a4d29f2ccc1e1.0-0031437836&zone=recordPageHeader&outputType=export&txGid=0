Climate change effects are explained by way of the hydrological equation. This serves as a backdrop to a brief review, in a hydrological context, of projected perturbations to temperature, rainfall and potential evaporation, over southern Africa. Methodologies for simulating hydrological responses to climate change are assessed. These include more direct GCM-derived output, with some emphasis on recent advances in climatic downscaling, and the application of appropriate hydrological models for use in impact studies. Scale problems of importance to hydrologists are highlighted. Directions to which climate change-related hydrological research efforts should be expended in South Africa are summarized, before two case study simulations, one a general sensitivity study of hydrological responses to changes in rainfall over southern Africa, the other a more specific hydrological response study to the El Niño of the 1982-83 season, are presented. The article concludes with a discussion on whether or not water resources practitioners in South Africa should respond to climate change.","Climate change; Downscaling; Hydrological response; Sensitivity; South Africa","climate change; hydrological response; South Africa",,,,,,"Bass, B., (1993) Summary Report on IGBP/BAHC Workshop on Focus 4: the Weather Generator Project, , Berlin: IGBP-BAHC Core Project Office, Department of Meteorology, Free University, Berlin; Belachew, A.B., (1996) Filtering the Effect of Orography from Moisture Recycling Patterns, , MSc thesis, International Institute for Infrastructural, Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, Delft; Beran, M., Hydrological impacts - What if we are right?
