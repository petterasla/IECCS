Information on physiological adjustment of alpine plants to temperature changes can provide insights into our understanding how these plants are responding to current and future warming. We tested the hypothesis that alpine plants would exhibit acclimation in photosynthesis and respiration under long-term elevated temperature, and the acclimation may relatively increase leaf carbon gain under warming conditions. Methods Open-top chambers (OTCs) were set up for a period of 11 years to artificially increase the temperature in an alpine meadow ecosystem. We measured leaf photosynthesis and dark respiration under different light, temperature and ambient CO2 concentrations for Gentiana straminea, a species widely distributed on the Tibetan Plateau. Maximum rates of the photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax), RuBP carboxylation (Vcmax) and temperature sensitivity of respiration Q10 were obtained from the measurements. We further estimated the leaf carbon budget of G. straminea using the physiological parameters and environmental variables obtained in the study. Important findings 1)The OTCs consistently elevated the daily mean air temperature by ∼1.6°C and soil temperature by ∼0.5°C during the growing season. 2)Despite the small difference in the temperature environment, there was strong tendency in the temperature acclimation of photosynthesis. The estimated temperature optimum of light-saturated photosynthetic CO2 uptake (Amax) shifted ∼1°C higher from the plants under the ambient regime to those under the OTCs warming regime, and the Amax was significantly lower in the warming-acclimated leaves than the leaves outside the OTCs. 3)Temperature acclimation of respiration was large and significant: the dark respiration rates of leaves developed in the warming regime were significantly lower than leaves from the ambient environments. 4)The simulated net leaf carbon gain was significantly lower in the in situ leaves under the OTCs warming regime than under the ambient open regime. However, in comparison with the assumed non-acclimation leaves, the in situ warming-acclimated leaves exhibited significantly higher net leaf carbon gain. 5)The results suggest that there was a strong and significant temperature acclimation in physiology of G. straminea in response to long-term warming, and the physiological acclimation can reduce the decrease of leaf carbon gain, i.e. increase relatively leaf carbon gain under the warming condition in the alpine species.","Acclimation; Alpine plant; Experimental warming; Open-top chamber; Photosynthesis; Temperature","Gentiana; Gentiana straminea",,,,,,"Allen, L.H., Drake, B.G., Rogers, H.H., Field techniques for exposure of plant and ecosystems to elevated CO 2 and other trace gases (1992) Crit Rev Plant Sci, 11, pp. 85-119; Arft, A.M., Walker, M.D., Gurevitch, J., Responses of tundra plants to experimental warming: Meta-analysis of the International Tundra Experiment (1999) Ecol Monogr, 69, pp. 491-511; Arnone, J.A., Körner, C., Temperature adaption and acclimation potential of leaf dark respiration in two species of Ranunculus from warm and cold habitats (1997) Arct Alp Res, 29, pp. 122-125; Atkin, O.K., Holly, C., Ball, M.C., Acclimation of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) leaf respiration to seasonal and diurnal variations in temperature: The importance of changes in the capacity and temperature sensitivity of respiration (2000) Plant Cell Environ, 23, pp. 15-26; Atkin, O.K., Scheurwater, I., Pons, T.L., High thermal acclimation potential of both photosynthesis and respiration in two lowland Plantago species in contrast to an alpine congeneric (2006) Glob Chang Biol, 12, pp. 500-515; Atkin, O.K., Tjoelker, M.G., Thermal acclimation and the dynamic response of plant respiration to temperature (2003) Trends Plant Sci, 8, pp. 343-351; Azcón-Bieto, J., Lambers, H., Day, D.A., Effect of photosynthesis and carbohydrate status on respiratory rates and the involvement of the alternative pathway in leaf respiration (1983) Plant Physiol, 72, pp. 59-603; Beniston, M., Mountain weather and climate: A general overview and a focus on climatic change in the Alps (2006) Hydrobiologia, 562, pp. 3-16; Berry, J.A., Björkman, O., Photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants (1980) Annu Rev Plant Physiol, 31, pp. 491-543; Brooks, A., Farquhar, G.D., Effect of temperature on the CO2/O2 specificity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase and the rate of respiration in the light-estimates from gas-exchange measurement on spinach (1985) Planta, 165, pp. 397-406; Bruhn, D., Egerton, J.J.C., Loveys, B.R., Evergreen leaf respiration acclimates to long-term nocturnal warming under field conditions (2007) Glob Chang Biol, 13, pp. 1216-1223; Campbell, C.D., Atkinson, L.J., Zaragoza-Castells, J., Acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration is asynchronous in response to changes in temperature regardless of plant functional group (2007) New Phytol, 176, pp. 375-389; Ceulemans, R., Mousseau, M., Tansley review No. 71 effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on woody plants (1994) New Phytol, 127, pp. 425-446; Collier, D.E., No difference in leaf respiration rates among temperature, subarctic, and arctic species grown under controlled conditions (1996) Can J Bot, 74, pp. 317-320; Covey-Crump, E.M., Regulation of root respiration in two species of Plantago that differ in relative growth rate: The effect of short- and long-term changes in temperature (2002) Plant Cell Environ, 25, pp. 1501-1513; Cui, X.Y., Tang, Y.H., Gu, S., Leaf orientation, incident sunlight and photosynthesis in the alpine species Suassurea superba and Gentiana straminea on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2004) Arct Antarct Alp Res, 36, pp. 219-228; Dewar, R.C., Medlyn, B.E., McMurtrie, R.E., Acclimation of the respiration photosynthesis ratio to temperature: Insights from a model (1999) Glob Chang Biol, 5, pp. 615-622; Farquhar, G.D., Von Caemmerer, S., Berry, J.A., A biochemical model of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in leaves of C3 species (1980) Planta, 149, pp. 78-90; Flexas, J., D́az-Espejo, A., Berry, J.A., Analysis of leakage in IRGA's leaf chambers of open gas exchange systems: Quantification and its effects in photosynthesis parameterization (2007) J Exp Bot, 58, pp. 1533-1543; Gunderson, C.A., Norby, R.J., Wullschleger, S.D., Acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration to simulated climatic warming in northern and southern populations of Acer saccharum: Laboratory and field evidence (2000) Tree Physiol, 20, pp. 87-96; Harley, P.C., Tenhunen, J.D., Modeling the photosynthetic response of C3 leaves to environmental factors (1991) Modeling Crop Photosynthesis from Biochemistry to Canopy, pp. 17-39. , Boote KJ, Loomis RS (eds).
