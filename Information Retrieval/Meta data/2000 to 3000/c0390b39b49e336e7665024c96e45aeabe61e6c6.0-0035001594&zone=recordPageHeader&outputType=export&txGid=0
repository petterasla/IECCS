Local temperature, precipitation, clouds, atmospheric water vapor, wind speed, and wind direction influence atmospheric chemical processes, and interactions occur between local and global-scale environments. If the climate becomes warmer and more variable, air quality is likely to be affected. However, the specific types of change (i.e., local, regional, or global), the direction of change in a particular location (i.e., positive or negative), and the magnitude of change in air quality that may be attributable to climate change are a matter of speculation, based on extrapolating present understanding to future scenarios. There is already extensive evidence on the health effects of air pollution. Ground-level ozone can exacerbate chronic respiratory diseases and cause short-term reductions in lung function. Exposure to particulate matter can aggravate chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, alter host defenses, damage lung tissue, lead to premature death, and possibly contribute to cancer. Health effects of exposures to carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide can include reduced work capacity, aggravation of existing cardiovascular diseases, effects on pulmonary function, respiratory illnesses, lung irritation, and alterations in the lung's defense systems. Adaptations to climate change should include ensuring responsiveness of air quality protection programs to changing pollution levels. Research needs include basic atmospheric science work on the association between weather and air pollutants; improving air pollution models and their linkage with climate change scenarios; and closing gaps in the understanding of exposure patterns and health effects.","Air pollution; Climate change; Criteria air pollutants; Global warming; Ozone; Particulate matter","acid; allergen; carbon monoxide; lead; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; acclimatization; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; air quality control; airborne particle; article; atmosphere; cancer; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; chemical reaction; chronic respiratory tract disease; climate; cloud; controlled study; disease exacerbation; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; high temperature; host resistance; human; lung disease; lung function; lung injury; particulate matter; precipitation; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; United States; velocity; water vapor; weather; wind; work capacity; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Allergens; Carbon Monoxide; Climate; Environmental Exposure; Fossil Fuels; Fungi; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Lead; Nitrogen Dioxide; Oxidants, Photochemical; Ozone; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Risk Factors; Sulfur Dioxide; United States",,"Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Carbon Monoxide, 630-08-0; Fossil Fuels; Lead, 7439-92-1; Nitrogen Dioxide, 10102-44-0; Oxidants, Photochemical; Ozone, 10028-15-6; Sulfur Dioxide, 7446-09-5",,,,"Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.A. §§7401-7671qPenner, J.E., Connell, P.S., Wuebbles, D.J., Covey, C.C., Climate change and its interactions with air chemistry: Perspective and research needs (1989), The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change on the United States (Smith JB, Tirpak DA, eds).
