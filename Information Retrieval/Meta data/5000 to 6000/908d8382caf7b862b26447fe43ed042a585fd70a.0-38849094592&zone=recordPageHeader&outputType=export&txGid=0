The data are taken from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. The leading meridional mode shows opposite characteristics in its spatial and temporal distributions at the high and low latitudes at the three levels. The latitude differences are significantly enlarged in recent 60 years. An abrupt change occurred in the mid-1970s, leading the phases of the first mode reversed at the low and high latitudes in both hemispheres. The variability is generally larger in Southern Hemisphere (SH) at 1000 and 500 hPa, but in Northern Hemisphere (NH) at 100 hPa. In contrast, the second meridional mode shows different features in its spatial and temporal distributions. It mainly manifests as the AAO and AO at 1000 and 100 hPa. The two oscillations have a negative correlation at interannual and interdecadal scales, and show strong anti-phase variations at the SH and NH high latitudes at 100 hPa level, suggesting that the mode could connect the SH and NH circulation at mid- and high latitudes and affect global climate change.","Climate variability; Height field; Meridional mode; The global atmospheric-circulation","atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate oscillation; climate variation; geopotential; meridional circulation; Northern Hemisphere; Southern Hemisphere; spatial distribution; temporal distribution",,,,,,"Wang, S.W., Vacillation of general circulation in recent 90-years (Part I) (1964) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 34, pp. 486-506. , in Chinese; Wang, S.W., Vacillation of general circulation in recent 90-years (Part II) (1965) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 35, pp. 200-213. , in Chinese; Yan, H.S., Wan, Y.X., Cheng, J.G., Interannual and interdecadal variations in atmospheric circulation factors and rainfall in China and their relationship (2005) Acta Meteorol.
