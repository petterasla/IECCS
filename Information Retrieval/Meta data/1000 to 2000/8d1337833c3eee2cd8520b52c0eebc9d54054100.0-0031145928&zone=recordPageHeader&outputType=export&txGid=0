This research requires one to correctly determine the sound speed from the sea surface to the bathyal zone. The calculation of sound speed is primarily based on the equation for the speed of sound determined by Del Grosso and Chen and Millero. There are many discussions with respect to the differences between the equation for sound speed by Chen and Millero and that by Del Grosso. We measured data of temperature, salinity, pressure and sound speed from the sea surface to the bathyal zone in detail using the deep submergence vehicle, ""SHINKAI 6500,"" from the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC). From our measurements, the constant term of the gradient of sound speed from the measured data agrees with that of the equation derived by Chen and Millero, while the first and the second terms of the gradient of sound speed from the measured data agree with that of the equation by Del Grosso.","Bathyal zone; Equation of sound speed; Gradient of sound speed; Pressure coefficient","Bathyal zone; Ocean acoustic tomography (OAT); Sound speed equation; Acoustic imaging; Acoustic wave velocity measurement; Computational methods; Global warming; Pressure effects; Pressure measurement; Salinity measurement; Surface waters; Temperature measurement; Acoustic wave velocity",,,,,,"Del Grosso, V.A., (1974) J.
