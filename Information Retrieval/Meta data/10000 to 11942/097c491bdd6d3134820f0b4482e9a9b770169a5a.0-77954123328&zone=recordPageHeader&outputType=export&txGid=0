Indian annual mean (average of maximum and minimum), maximum and minimum temperatures showed significant warming trends of 0.51, 0.72 and 0.27°C 100 yr 1, respectively, during the period 1901-2007. However, accelerated warming was observed in the recent period 1971-2007, mainly due to intense warming in the recent decade 1998-2007. Temperatures (mean, maximum and minimum) increased by about 0.2°C per decade for the period 1971-2007, with a much steeper increase in minimum temperature than maximum temperature. In the most recent decade, maximum temperature was significantly higher compared to the long-term (1901-2007) mean, with a stagnated trend during this period, whereas minimum temperature showed an increasing trend, almost equal to that observed during 1971-2007. On a seasonal scale, pronounced warming trends in mean temperature were observed in winter and monsoon seasons, and a significant influence of El Niño Southern Oscillation events on temperature anomalies during certain seasons across India was observed. The composites of maximum and minimum temperatures of El Niño years showed positive anomalies during monsoon, post-monsoon and subsequent year winter and pre-monsoon seasons. However, statistically significant positive anomalies were observed only during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons over large areas of the country. The composite temperature anomalies of La Niña years were almost opposite to El Niño composites: the negative temperature anomalies associated with La Niña events persisted from the current monsoon season to the subsequent year pre-monsoon season. © Inter-Research 2010.","Decadal average temperature; Enso; Global warming; India; Temperature trend","Annual mean; Annual trends; Average temperature; Decadal average temperature; East coast; Himalayas; Homogeneous regions; Maximum temperature; Mean temperature; Monsoon season; Negative temperatures; Post-monsoon; Pre-monsoon; Seasonal scale; Southern Oscillation; Surface air temperature variability; Surface air temperatures; Temperature anomaly; Temperature trends; West coast; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Lasers; Nickel compounds; Atmospheric thermodynamics; air temperature; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; La Nina; regional climate; temperature anomaly; temperature effect; Himalayas; India",,,,,,"Halpert, M.S., Ropelewski, C.F., Surface temperature patterns associated with the southern oscillation (1992) J Clim, 5, pp. 577-593; Hingane, L.S., Kumar, K.R., Ramana Murthy, Bh.V., Long-term trends of surface air temperature in India (1985) Int.
