Warming effects are also thought to play a role in runaway growth of other species, e.g., the quagga mussel invasion of Lake Mead. The mechanisms underlying runaway growth or extinction are poorly understood. We investigate these mechanisms in a discrete population equation which models the effects of environmental fluctuations of the population growth rate. The model predicts extinction when E(In(l)), the geometric mean of the population growth rate, decreases below zero, and runaway growth when E(In(l)) > 0. A major challenge is to estimate realizations at specific generation numbers, n, during runaway growth, or extinction, type events. Thus, we our main focus is to derive dynamic bounds which estimate realizations, at each n 1, during the entire course of such events. These estimates are illustrated with examples. In particular, we give new insights into the dynamics of the present day ongoing Kenyan lion extinction.
