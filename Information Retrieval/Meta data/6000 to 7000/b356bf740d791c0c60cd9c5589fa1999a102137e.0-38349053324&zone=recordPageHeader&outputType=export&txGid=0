This study provides new insight into how global warming could cause separation of species within present-day communities. We find that winter relative abundances of similarly-sized songbirds are differentially affected by ambient winter temperature. As such, average annual winter temperature fluctuations (i.e., severity of winter) are significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with the relative abundances of three species while the other three are not. Our conditional probability-of-occurrence analysis indicates that the abundances of the three temperature-associated species declined markedly below -4°C while the abundances of the other three species fluctuated little from 8°C to -16°C. We conclude that even in colder climates i) the winter distributions of some, but not all, songbirds are directly or indirectly limited by temperature; and ii) these birds have dynamic abundances that can quickly respond to temperature changes. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2007.",,"global warming; population decline; population distribution; relative abundance; songbird; temperature; winter; animal; article; greenhouse effect; population density; population dynamics; season; songbird; temperature; United States; Animals; Greenhouse Effect; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Songbirds; Temperature; United States; Aves; Passeri; Passeriformes",,,,,,"Andrewartha, H.G., Birch, L.C., (1954) The Distribution and Abundance of Animals, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 782 pp; Parmesan, C., Ryrholm, N., Stefanescu, C., Hill, J.K., Thomas, C.D., Descimon, H., Huntley, B., Kaila, L., Poleward shifts in geographical ranges of butterfly species associated with regional warming (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 579-583; Sagarin, R.D., Barry, J.P., Gilman, S.E., Baxter, C.H., Climate-related change in an intertidal community over short and long time scales (1999) Ecol.
