Two powerful tools - climate change risk assessment and total water management - can be used to determine the vulnerability of water management systems to climate change. These tools can also be used to drive the development of integrated water management strategies and infrastructure to provide water supplies that are more resilient to the effects of climate change. One approach for assessing the risks of climate change to water systems is to use a dual analytical framework known as the threshold-scenario risk assessment. The framework comprises two parts: the more qualitative threshold risk assessment approach and the quantitative scenario risk assessment approach. This article provides tools, resources, examples, and new, holistic solutions that that can be used to manage both the built and natural portions of the water cycle. Water professionals will find this approach more effective than considering the components separately when addressing the challenges posed by global climate change.",,"Global climate changes; Integrated water management; new approaches; Total water management; Water cycling; Water management systems; water planning; Water professionals; Water resource management; water systems; Water uses; Climate control; Climatology; Information management; Knowledge management; Management; Offshore oil well production; Photoacoustic effect; Planning; Resource allocation; Reusability; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risks; Safety engineering; Strategic planning; Tools; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Climate change",,,,,,"Frederick, K. & Gleick, P., 1999.
