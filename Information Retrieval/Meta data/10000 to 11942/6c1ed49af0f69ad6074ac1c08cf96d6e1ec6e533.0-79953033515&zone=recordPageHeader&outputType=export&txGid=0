Design modifications to outdoor environments can increase thermal comfort, and in extreme cases can be life-saving. This is not work for amateurs, or for professionals using their intuition or personal experiences. This work must be based on scholarly evidence acquired through carefully designed studies, accurate and precise measurements, and appropriate analysis. Built landscapes should be evaluated to determine if they achieved their microclimate modifying objectives, and the resulting information should be used to inform future studies. Methods for incorporating microclimate information in design should be made more user-friendly and accessible to designers, and knowledge about the effects of landscape planning and design on climate should be effectively communicated to decision-makers at all levels. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Energy budget model; Human thermal comfort; Instrumentation; Landscape architecture; Urban climate","Energy budget model; Human thermal comfort; Instrumentation; Landscape architecture; Urban climates; Budget control; Climate models; Design; Instruments; Thermal comfort; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; decision making; energy budget; environmental planning; landscape planning; landscape structure; microclimate; urban climate",,,,,,"Brown, G.Z., DeKay, M., (2001) Sun, Wind and Light: Architectural Design Strategies, , John Wiley and Sons, New York; Brown, R.D., (2010) Design with Microclimate: The Secret to Comfortable Outdoor Space, , Island Press, Washington, DC; Chameides, W.L., Lindsay, R.W., Richardson, J., Kiang, C.S., The role of biogenic hydrocarbons in urban photochemical smog: Atlanta as a case study (1988) Science, 241, pp. 1473-1475; Gillespie, T.J., Brown, R.D., Modifying air quality (2007) Landscape Architectural Graphic Standards, pp. 96-99. , John Wiley & Sons, New York, L.J.
