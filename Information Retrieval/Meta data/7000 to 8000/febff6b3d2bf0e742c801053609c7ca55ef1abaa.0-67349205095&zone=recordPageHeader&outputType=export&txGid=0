Thus, one might expect a considerable part of the Alpine flora to be ethnobotanically relevant as has been documented for the Eastern Himalaya. As climate change, especially global warming, may lead to the extinction of Alpine plants, at least locally, loss of alpine species might be important to local people who rely on traditional medicine. How this holds for the Alps will be discussed in this contribution. The Alps are different from the Himalayas in that land use has changed dramatically during the past century. Rural life and culture has changed and much land has been abandoned or is under modern land use systems (industrial farming, tourism, urbanisation). Though much traditional knowledge has disappeared, traditional medicinal practices are still popular as supplemental to modern medicine. In a representative region in the Central Alps, traditional healers use 268 plants species of which 158 can be considered native to that area. Of the 25 predominantly Alpine species three are restricted to the highest Alps where warming might lead to their extinction. In the Alps some ornamental plants are of particular interest from an ethnobotanical point of view. People are apparently much more interested in what happens to Edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum) than to medicinal plants. Other famous ornamentals (Leontopodium, Rhododendron, Gentiana, Anemone species) do not grow at critical high elevations, but could disappear locally from mountains which are too low in elevation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
