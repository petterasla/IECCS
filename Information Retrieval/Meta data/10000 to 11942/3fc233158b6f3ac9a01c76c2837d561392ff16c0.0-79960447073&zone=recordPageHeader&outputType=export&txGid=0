It is found that during last 30 years, occurrence frequency of hail and the number of heavy hailstorms in the mountainous areas of the Northern Caucasus decreased, on average, by a factor of 1.5-2, and in the foothill areas increased by 15-20%. It is shown that efficiency of hail protection works should be estimated taking into account the hail danger trend for each region. © 2011 Allerton Press, Inc.",,"Caucasus; Mountainous area; Protection work; Climatology; Efficiency; Global warming; Storms; Precipitation (meteorology); climate change; climatology; estimation method; global warming; hail; mountain region; Caucasus",,,,,,"Abshaev, M.T., Abshaev, A.M., Nesmeyanov, P.A., The Russian Automated Technology for Hail Protection (2007) Ekologiya i Promyshlennost'Rossii, , June, [Russian Ecology and Industry, June (2007)]; Abshaev, M.T., Borisova, N.A., Malkarova, A.M., On Climate Change Tendency in the Northern Caucasus (2004) Proceedings of the Young Scientists Conference in Honor of the 90th Anniversary of G.
