A May-July temperature proxy extending back to 1836 was developed from tree-ring width of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) found in the middle Lüliang Mountains, northern China. Correlations with climatic data from six nearby meteorological stations range from -0.58 to -0.65, indicating a strong response of tree-ring index to May-July mean temperatures, which were subsequently reconstructed. The reconstruction captures 45% (F=38.474, P<0.001) of the regional variance in the instrumental data over the calibration period 1955-2003. Reconstructed warm and cold periods were verified by additional temperature reconstructions based on tree-ring data from northern China. In addition, the reconstruction was significantly correlated with May-July mean temperatures from 13 other meteorological stations in northern China, suggesting that our reconstruction is also representative of north-central China. The warming trend during the second half of the 20th century is seen in the reconstruction, but only the 1994-2002 mean temperature seems unprecedented over the whole reconstructed period. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Lüliang Mountains; Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.; reconstruction; temperature; tree-ring width","Pinus tabuliformis",,,,,,"(2007) IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Briffa, K.R., Schweingruber, F.H., Jones, P.D., Reduced sensitivity of recent tree growth to temperature at high northern latitudes (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 678-682; Esper, J., Cook, E.R., Schweingruber, F.H., Low frequency signals in long tree-ring chronologies for reconstructing past temperature variability (2002) Science, 295, pp. 2250-2253; McCarroll, D., Loader, N.J., Stable isotopes in tree rings (2004) Quat Sci Rev, 23, pp. 771-801; Treydte, K.S., Schleser, G.H., Helle, G., The twentieth century was the wettest period in northern Pakistan over the past millennium (2006) Nature, l440, pp. 1179-1182; Liu, Y., An, Z.S., Linderholm, H.W., Annual temperatures during the last 2485 years in the mid-eastern Tibetan Plateau inferred from tree rings (2009) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 52, pp. 348-359; Shao, X.M., Huang, L., Liu, H.B., Reconstruction of precipitation variation from tree rings in recent 1000 years in Delingha, Qinghai (2004) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 48, pp. 939-949; Zhang, Q.B., Cheng, G.D., Yao, T.D., A 2326-year tree-ring record of climate variability on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (2003) Geophys Res Lett, 30, pp. 1739-1742; Liu, Y., Cai, Q.F., Shi, J.F., Seasonal precipitation in the south-central Helan Mountain region, China, reconstructed from tree-ring width for the past 224 years (2005) Can J For Res, 35, pp. 2403-2412; Liu, Y., Sun, J.Y., Yang, Y.K., Tree-ring precipitation records from Inner Mongolia, china, and the East Asian summer monsoon front variation since 1627 AD (2007) Tree-Ring Res, 63, pp. 3-14; Liu, Y., Linderholm, H.W., Song, H.M., Temperature variations recorded in Pinus tabulaeformis tree rings from the southern and northern slopes of the central Qinling Mountains, central China (2006) Boreas, 38, pp. 285-291; Cai, Q.F., Liu, Y., January to August temperature variability since 1776 inferred from tree-ring width of Pinus tabulaeformis in Helan Mountain (2007) J Geogr Sci, 17, pp. 293-303; Cai, Q.F., Liu, Y., Song, H.M., Tree-ring-based reconstruction of the April to September mean temperature since 1826 AD for north-central Shaanxi Province, China (2008) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 51, pp. 1099-1106; Hou, Y., Wang, N.A., Li, G., Reconstruction of summer average temperature from tree-ring proxy data during 1751-2005 in Mt.
