Current global operational products relevant to climate studies include: atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles, winds, clouds, aerosols, ozone, sea surface temperature, vegetation index, snow cover and sea ice, planetary albedo, and outgoing longwave radiation. Current experimental operational products include sea surface wind speed, precipitable water, precipitation rate, show cover and sea ice cover from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and surface and atmospheric longwave radiation fluxes from the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) radiance observations. Racent results, accuracy estimates based on comparison with ground truth, and problems and possibilities for using operational satellite data for long-term global climate change studies are presented. © 1993.",,"global climate change; planetary albedo; precipitation rate; sea surface temperature; TOVS",,,,,,"Ohring, McClain, Ellis, Operational Satellites: Sentinels for the Monitoring of Climate and Global Change (1991) Global and Planetary Change, , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Pichel, Operational production f multichannel sea surface temperatures from NOAA polar satellite AVHRR data (1991) Global and Planetary Change, 4, pp. 173-178; R.
