Spruce (Picea glauca, P. engelmannii) of the same seedlot and stocktype, was planted at the same time on the same site-types. Site 1 (S1) utilized different sizes of inverted mineral mounds and Site 2 (S2) used mounding coupled with herbicide (glyphosate) site preparation or brushing treatments. Ten year survival on mounds was 100% at S2 and greater than 90% at S1. Control treatment survival was 34 and 66% at S1 and S2, respectively. Mounding increased 10 year stem volume (SV) by more than 300% over control at S1. Mounding or herbicide site preparation approximately doubled the SV over control while mounding plus herbicide site preparation resulted in a three fold increase of SV at S2. Pissoides leader weevil incidence was at endemic levels at both sites but it is expected to increase if global warming scenarios hold. This would reduce future site productivity. The most costly treatment to establish at S2, mounding plus herbicide site preparation, was the most cost effective at year 10. These data suggest that spending more at establishment can result in greater survival, growth and return on investment. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","artificial regeneration; glyphosate; mounds; Picea; Pissoides","Cost effectiveness; Drainage; Global warming; Herbicides; Plants (botany); Productivity; Seed; Soils; Artificial regeneration; Glyphosate; Mineral mounds; Picea engelmannii; Picea glauca; Pissoides; Reforestation; Forestry; glyphosate; herbicide; conference paper; cost effectiveness analysis; forest; forestry; nonhuman; regeneration; soil; statistical model; Picea; Picea engelmannii; Picea glauca; Engelmann spruce; regeneration; weevil; white spruce; Canada, British Columbia, Bowron River",,,,,,"Anonymous: 1991, Tour Guide.
