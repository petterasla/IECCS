Using a time-course approach, we investigated the effects of elevated atmospheric C02(eCO2),soil warming and drought and their interactions on root length colonized (RLC) by mycorrhizal fungi and extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) production. Plant growth responded as would be expected to the environmental manipulations. There was no plant growth-independent effect of eCO2 on mycorrhizal colonization; however, EMH production was stimulated by eCO2, i.e. there was increased partitioning of below-ground carbon to the EMH. Soil warming directly stimulated both percent RLC by the Glomus species and EMH density; soil warming did not affect RLC by the fine endophyte. Drought decreased percent RLC for the fine endophyte, but not for the Glomus species. The presence of one mycorrhizal fungus did not affect the response of another to the environmental variables. There was no evidence of any interactive effects of the environmental variables on RLC, but there were significant environmental interactions on EMH production. In particular, the stimulatory effects of eCO2 and soil warming on EMH density were not additive. The results are discussed in terms of the soil carbon cycle, highlighting some crucial gaps in our knowledge. If future environmental changes affect mycorrhizal fungal turnover and respiration, then this could have important implications for the terrestrial carbon cycle. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; External mycorrhizal hyphae; Global environmental change; Increased atmospheric CO2; Percent root length colonized","carbon dioxide enrichment; drought stress; fungus; global change; mycorrhiza; root colonization; soil temperature; Fungi; Glomus; Glomus caledonium; Glomus mosseae; Lanceolata; Plantago; Plantago lanceolata",,,,,,"Augé, R.M., Water relations, drought and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (2001) Mycorrhiza, 11, pp. 3-42; Augé, R.M., Stodola, A.J., Ebel, R.C., Leaf elongation and water relations of mycorrhizal sorghum in response to partial soil drying: Two Glomus species at varying phosphorus fertilization (1995) Journal of Experimental Botany, 46, pp. 297-307; Bethlenfalvay, G.J., Brown, M.S., Ames, R.N., Effects of drought on host and endophyte development in mycorrhizal soybeans in relation to water use and phosphate uptake (1988) Physiologia Plantarum, 72, pp. 565-571; Braunberger, P.G., Abbott, L.K., Robson, A.D., The effect of rain in the dry-season on the formation of vesicular-arbucular mycorrhizas in the growing-season of annual clover-based pastures (1994) New Phytologist, 127, pp. 107-114; Braunberger, P.G., Abbott, L.K., Robson, A.D., Early vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation in soil collected from an annual clover-based pasture in a Mediterranean environment: Soil temperature and the timing of autumn rains (1997) Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 48, pp. 103-110; Bruneau, P.M.C., Ostle, N., Davidson, D.A., Determination of rhizosphere 13C pulse signals in soil thin sections by laser ablation isotope ratio mass spectrometry (2002) Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 16, pp. 2190-2194; Cao, M., Woodward, F.I., Dynamic responses of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling to global climate change (1998) Nature, 393, pp. 249-252; Coleman, D.C., Crossley, D.A., (1996) Fundamentals of Soil Ecology, , Academic Press, San Diego, CA; Davidson, E.A., Trumbore, S.E., Amundson, R., Soil warming and organic carbon content (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 789-790; Easterling, D.R., Meehl, G.A., Parmesan, C., Climate extremes: Observations, modeling and impacts (2000) Science, 289, pp. 2068-2074; Edwards, E.J., Benham, D.G., Marland, L.A., Root production is determined by radiation flux in a temperate grassland community (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 209-227; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Fitter, A.H., Heinerneyer, A., Staddon, P.L., The impact of elevated C02and global climate change on arbuscular mycorrhizas: A mycocentric approach (2000) New Phytologist, 147, pp. 179-187; Gavito, M.E., Bruhn, D., Jakobsen, I., Phosphorus uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae does not increase when the host plant grows under atmospheric C02enrichment (2002) New Phytologist, 154, pp. 751-760; Gavito, M.E., Curtis, P.S., Mikkelsen, T.N., Atmospheric C02and mycorrhiza effects on biomass allocation and nutrient uptake of nodulated pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants (2000) Journal of Experimental Botany, 51, pp. 1931-1938; Gavito, M.E., Schweiger, P., Jakobsen, I., P uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae: Effect of soil temperature and atmospheric C02enrichment (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 106-116; Grace, J., Understanding and managing the global carbon cycle (2004) Journal of Ecology, 92, pp. 189-202; Hepper, C.M., Azcon-Aguilar, C., Rosendahl, S., Competition between three species of Glomus used as spatially separated introduced and indigenous mycorrhizal inocula for leek (Allium porrum L.)
