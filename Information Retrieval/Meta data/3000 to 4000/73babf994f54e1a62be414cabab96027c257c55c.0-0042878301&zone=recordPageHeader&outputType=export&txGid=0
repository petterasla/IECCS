The notion of economic sustainability is associated with the concept of turnpike in infinite horizon optimization models. The issue of deciding on the proper discount rate is addressed in this context and a method is proposed to reconcile long term sustainability and short term time preference for current generations. One also formulates a model where environmental damage and/or technical progress are represented as stochastic jump processes. One calls this random evolution a mode switching process. In this context, sustainability is represented by a family of turnpikes, and the economy will be driven from one steady state to the other as the modes switch. These concepts are illustrated on the DICE model and their possible implementation in other types of integrated assessment models is discussed.",,,,,,,,"Altman, A., Feinberg, E., Schwartz, A., Weighted discounted stochastic games with perfect information (2000) Advances in Dynamic Games and Applications, , eds.
