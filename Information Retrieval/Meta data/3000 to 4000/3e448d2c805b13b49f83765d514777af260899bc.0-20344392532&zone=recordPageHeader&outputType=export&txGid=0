The results show that the correlation coefficients between NDVI in previous season and summer precipitation are positive in most regions of China, and the lagged correlations show a significant difference between regions. The stronger correlations between NDVI in previous winter and precipitation in summer occur in Central China and the Tibetan Plateau, and the correlations between spring NDVI and summer precipitation in the eastern arid/semi-arid region and the Tibetan Plateau are more significant. Vegetation changes have more sensitive feedback effects on climate in the three regions (eastern arid/semi-arid region, Central China and Tibetan Plateau). The lagged correlations between NDVI and precipitation suggest that, on interannual time scales, land cover affects summer precipitation to a certain extent. The correlations between NDVI in previous season and summer temperature show more complex, and the lagged responses of temperature to vegetation are weaker compared with precipitation, and they are possibly related to the global warming which partly cover up the correlations.","NDVI; Response of climate; Vegetation change",,,,,,,"Charney, J.G., Dynamics of deserts and drought in the Sahel (1975) Q.
