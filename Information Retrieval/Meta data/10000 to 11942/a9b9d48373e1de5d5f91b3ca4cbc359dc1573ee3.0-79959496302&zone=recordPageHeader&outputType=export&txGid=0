Driven by enhanced stratification and a northward shift in the mid-latitude westerlies under climate change, model projections demonstrated that between 2000 and 2100, the area of the subtropical biome expands by ∼30 by 2100, whereas the area of temperate and equatorial upwelling (EU) biomes decreases by ∼34 and 28, respectively, by 2100. Over the century, the total biome primary production and fish catch is projected to increase by 26 in the subtropical biome and decrease by 38 and 15 in the temperate and the equatorial biomes, respectively. Although the primary production per unit area declines slightly in the subtropical and the temperate biomes, it increases 17 in the EU biome. Two areas where the subtropical biome boundary exhibits the greatest movement is in the northeast Pacific, where it moves northwards by as much as 1000 km per 100 years and at the equator in the central Pacific, where it moves eastwards by 2000 km per 100 years. Lastly, by the end of the century, there are projected to be more than 25 million km2 of water with a mean sea surface temperature of 31°C in the subtropical and EU biomes, representing a new thermal habitat. The projected trends in biome carrying capacity and fish catch suggest resource managers might have to address long-term trends in fishing capacity and quota levels. © 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","biomes; climate model; global warming; North Pacific; ocean biogeochemistry model","biogeochemistry; biome; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carrying capacity; catch composition; climate modeling; fish; global warming; habitat type; numerical model; population decline; primary production; sea surface temperature; subtropical region; temperate environment; temperature effect; twenty first century; upwelling; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",,,,,,"Cheung, W.W.L., Lam, V.W.Y., Sarmentio, J.L., Kearney, K., Watson, R., Pauly, D., Projecting global marine biodiversity impacts under climate change scenarios (2009) Fish and Fisheries, 10, pp. 235-251; Conkright, M.E., Boyer, T.P., (2002) World Ocean Atlas 2001: Objective Analyses, Data Statistics, and Figures, CD-ROM Documentation, p. 17. , National Oceanographic Data Center, Silver Spring, MD; Delworth, T., Broccoli, A.J., Rosati, A., Stouffer, R., Balaji, V., Beesley, J.A., Cooke, W., GFDL's CM2 global coupled climate models.
