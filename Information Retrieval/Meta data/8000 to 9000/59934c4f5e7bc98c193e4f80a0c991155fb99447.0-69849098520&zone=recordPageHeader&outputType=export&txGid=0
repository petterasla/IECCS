The objective is to identify possible trends and cycles in such variations, from inter-annual to inter-decadal, and the possible reasons for such variations. The East Asian region is divided into three sub-regions: South (south China, Vietnam and the Philippines), Middle (east China), and North (Korean Peninsula and Japan). Variations in the annual number on various time scales in each region are examined separately. Part I reports on the results of wavelet analyses of the time series of the annual number in each region, and Part II examines the possible reasons for the cycles identified in Part I.An important finding from the time series analysis is that none of the ATC time series shows a significant linear trend, which suggests that global warming has not led to a higher frequency of landfalling tropical cyclones or typhoons in any of the regions in Asia. Instead, each time series shows large inter-annual (2-8 years) and multi-decadal (16-32 years) variations. In some periods, the annual number of ATCs varies in unison among all regions of Asia. In others, one region would have an above-normal number of landfalling events, while the other regions have below-normal numbers. In general, at multi-decadal time scales, the number of ATCs in each region correlates very well with that of the total number of tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific. © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society.","Global warming; Tropical cyclone variations; Western North Pacific","Comprehensive studies; East Asia; East China; Higher frequencies; Interannual; Interdecadal; Landfalling; Landfalling tropical cyclones; Multi-decadal time scale; Normal numbers; Philippines; South China; Sub-regions; Time-scales; Tropical cyclone; Tropical cyclone variations; Two-part series; Viet Nam; Western North Pacific; Global warming; Hurricanes; Number theory; Storms; Time series; Tropics; Wavelet analysis; Time series analysis; annual variation; decadal variation; global warming; spatial variation; storm track; time series analysis; trend analysis; tropical cyclone; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Korea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Philippines; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam",,,,,,"Chan, J.C.L., Tropical cyclone activity in the northwest Pacific in relation to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomenon (1985) Monthly Weather Review, 113, pp. 599-606; Chan, J.C.L., Comments on ""Changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity in a warming environment (2006) Science, 1713 b, p. 311; Emanuel, K.A., Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years (2005) Nature, 436, pp. 686-688; Holland, G.J., Misuse of landfall as a proxy for Atlantic tropical cyclone activity (2007) EOS Transactions-American Geophysical Union, 88 (36), pp. 349-350; Landsea, C.W., Hurricanes and global warming (2005) Nature, 438, pp. E11-E12; Landsea, C.W., Counting Atlantic tropical cyclones back to 1900 (2007) EOS, 88 (197), p. 2002; (2006) Climatological Atlas of Tropical Cyclones Affecting China (1951-2000), p. 177. , Shanghai Typhoon Institute.
