Increased foliage temperature (2.5°C above fluctuating ambient) was induced by heating the stand with infrared radiation sources, modulated by an electronic control device (FATI, Free Air Temperature Increase). Enhanced CO2 was produced by a FACE system (Free Air CO2 Enrichment). Exposure to simulated climate warming drastically reduced above-ground harvestable dry matter (52% loss). The nitrogen allocated to the leaf fraction was thus concentrated into less dry matter, which enhanced the nitrogen concentration on a mass basis (+17%) but also per unit leaf area (+47%). As a consequence, CO2 assimilation rates were not affected in these slower growing plants in the +2.5°C treatment, and the photochemical efficiency of non-cyclic electron transport of photosystem II was also unaffected. Although the plants were grown in the field without roof restrictions, long-term exposure to elevated CO2 concentration noticeable acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus (40% loss of fixation potential), which largely outweighted the direct stimulation in this summer period. Part of the reduced rates should be attributed to lower N concentration on a leaf area basis. The results are compared with responses of this species in sunlit conditioned greenhouses, which indicates that experiments in enclosures may underestimate effects in the field. This also emphasizes the need to validate other plant responses to climate warming and CO2 enrichment in free air conditions.","assimilation; elevated CO2 concentration; free air exposure; Global warming; Lolium perenne; productivity","Lolium perenne; Poaceae; climatic change simulation; global warming",,,,,,"Allen L.H., Jr., Drake, B.G., Rogers, H.H., Shinn, J.H., Field techniques for exposure of plants and ecosystems to elevated CO2 and other trace gases (1992) Crit.
