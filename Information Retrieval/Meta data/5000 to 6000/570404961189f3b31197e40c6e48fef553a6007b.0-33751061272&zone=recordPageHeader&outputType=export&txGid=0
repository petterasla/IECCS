Barren Island is located in the Sumatra-Andaman region, about 135 km east of Port Blair, and lies within the Burma microplate, the southern tip of which experienced a submarine earthquake (Mw 9.3) causing a tsunami in December 2004. Barren Island is the only volcano, which has shown sustained eruptive activity since shortly after the Great Sumatran Earthquake of December 2004. Our observations require further corroboration to relate how submarine earthquakes activate volcanoes and how far these thermal emissions influence climate changes. Because it links global warming and climate changes to the frequent emissions from a volcano activated by submarine earthquakes, this case study is of special interest to the earth-ocean-atmosphere sciences community. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Andaman Sea; Barren Island; Global warming; Volcano; Warmair pool","Earthquakes; Global warming; Submarine geology; Thermal effluents; Tsunamis; Volcanoes; Submarine earthquakes; Thermal emmissions; Warm air pool; Seismology; climate change; earthquake; global warming; tsunami; volcanic eruption; volcanology; warm pool; Andamans; Andamans and Nicobars; Asia; Barren Island; Eurasia; India; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; South Asia",,,,,,"Anwar, A., Climate change impacts and adaptation assessment in Bangladesh (1999) Clim Res, (12), pp. 109-116; Bandopadhyay, P.C., Sumit, K.M., Tapanpal, The 2005 eruption on Barren Island, Andaman Sea (2006) Curr Sci, 90 (5), pp. 620-622; Cadle, R.D., Kiang, C.S., Louis, J.F., The global scale depression of the eruption clouds from major volcanic eruptions (1976) J Geophys Res, 81, pp. 3125-3132; Emanuel, K.A., Thermodynamic control of hurricane intensity (1999) Nature, 401 (6754), pp. 665-669; Haldar, D., Petrology and chemistry of recent volcanism of Barren and Narcondam islands - The only two recent volcanoes in India (1989) Geol Surv India, 122 (3), pp. 48-49; Haldar, D., Lasker, T., Bandyopadhyay, P.C., Sarkar, N.K., Biswas, J.K., The volcanic eruption of the Barren Island volcano, Andaman Sea (1992) J Geol Soc India, 39 (5), pp. 411-419; Haldar, D., Chakraborty, S.C., Chakraborty, P.P., The 1995-eruption of the Barren Island volcano in the Andaman Sea (1995) Geol Surv India, 129 (3), pp. 59-61; Haldar, D., Luhr, J.F., The Barren Island volcanism during 1991 and 1994-1995: Eruptive style and lava petrology (2003) Members Geol Soc India, 52, pp. 313-338; Hegerl, G.C., Crowley, T.J., Baum, S.K., Kim, K.Y., Hyde, W.T., Detection of volcanic, solar and greenhouse gas signals in paleo-reconstructions of Northern Hemispehric temperature (2003) Geophys Res Lett, 30 (5), p. 1242. , Doi:10.1029/2002GL016635; Hill, D.P., Pollitz, F., Newhall, C., Earthquake - Volcano interactions (2002) Phys Today, 55, pp. 41-47; Javed, N.M., Murty, C.V.R., Landscape changes in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) due to M w 9.3 tsunamigenic Sumatra earthquake of 26 December 2004 (2005) Curr Sci, 88 (9), pp. 1384-1386; Jayu, N., Prasannakumar, S., Seasonal variability of the mixed layer in the central Bay of Bengal and associated changes in nutrients and chlorophyll (2006) Deep-Sea Res I, 53, pp. 820-835; K-I coupled GCM (MIROC) description (2004) K-I Technical Report 1, p. 34. , K.-I.
