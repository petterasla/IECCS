It is widely believed that DMS is mainly emitted from phytoplankton production in marine boundary layer (MBL), and MSA is usually used as the tracer of non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO4 2-) in marine and coastal areas (MSA/SO4 2- = 1/18). Many observations of MSA were in marine and coastal aerosols. To our surprise, MSA was frequently (&gt;60%) detected in Beijing TSP, PM10, and PM 2.5 aerosols, even in the samples collected during the dust storm period. The concentrations of MSA were higher than those measured in marine aerosols. Factor analysis, correlation analysis and meteorology analysis indicated that there was no obvious marine influence on Beijing aerosols. DMS from terrestrial emissions and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) from industrial wastes could be the two possible precursors of MSA. Warm and low-pressure air masses and long time radiation were beneficial to the formation of MSA. Anthropogenic pollution from regional and local sources might be the dominant contributor to MSA in Beijing aerosol. This was the first report of MSA in aerosols collected in an inland site in China. This new finding would lead to the further study on the balance of sulfur in inland cities and its global biogeochemical cycle.","Beijing; DMS; DMSO; MSA; Sulfate aerosol",,,,,,,"Charlson, R.J., Lovelock, J.E., Andreae, M.O., A climate feedback loop of sulfate aerosols (1987) Nature, 326, pp. 655-661; Huebert, B.J., Zhuang, L., Howell, S., Sulfate, nitrate, methanesulfonate, chloride, ammonium, and sodium measurements from ship, island, and aircraft during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition, Experiment/Marine Aerosol Gas Exchange (1996) Journal of Geophysical Research, [Atmospheres], 101 (D2), pp. 4413-4423; Saltzman, E.S., Savoie, D.L., Zika, R.G., Methane sulfonic acid in the marine atmosphere (1983) Journal of Geophysical Research, 88, pp. 10897-10902; Pakkanen, T.A., Kerminen, V.M., Korhonen, C.H., Urban and rural ultrafine (PM0.1) particles in the Helsinki area (2001) Atmospheric Environment, 35, pp. 4593-4607; Gao, Y., Arimoto, R., Duce, R.A., Atmospheric non-sea-salt sulfate, nitrate and methanesulfonate over the China Sea (1996) Journal of Geophysical Research, [Atmospheres], 101 (D7), pp. 12601-12611; Yuan, H., Wang, Y., Zhuang, G., Simultaneous determination of organic acid, methanesulfonic acid and inorganic anions in aerosol and precipitation samples by ion chromatography (2003) Journal of Instrumental Analysis (In Chinese), 22 (6), pp. 11-14; Zhuang, G., Guo, J., Yuan, H., The compositions, sources, and size distribution of the dust storm from China in spring of 2000 and its impact on the global environment (2001) Chinese Science Bulletin, 46 (1), pp. 895-901; Sun, Y., Zhuang, G., Yuan, U., Characteristics and sources of 2002 super dust storm in Beijing (2004) Chinese Science Bulletin, 49 (4), pp. 340-346; Hu, M., Lu, Y., Zeng, L.M., Determination of ambient methanesulfonic acid using ion chromatography (2000) Huanjing Huaxue (In Chinese), 19 (6), pp. 572-576; Cooper, J.A., Environmental impact of residential wood combustion emissions and its implications (1980) Journal of Air Pollution Control Association, 8, pp. 855-861; Kleinman, M.T., Tomezyk, C., Leaderer, B.P., Inorganic nitrogen compounds in New York City (1979) Air Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 322, pp. 115-123; Dimethyl sulfoxide.
