Therefore, the improvement of energy and environmental performances are relevant targets because precious building materials such as marble have a significant impact on the environment. The aim of this paper is an analysis of a typical Sicilian marble (Perlato di Sicilia) to evaluate its energy and environmental performance. Marble plays an important role in the economy of Italy and has a global market share of 58% in terms of exports. For the main production areas of marble, relevant environmental performance data are missing except for one region (Tuscany-Massa e Carrara province). Perlato di Sicilia, the main marble of Custonaci (Sicily), has never been analyzed previously. Materials and methods: Life cycle assessment (LCA) according to ISO 14040/44 is applied to marble tiles and slabs. For the life cycle inventory, data were collected from a representative plant in the Custonaci basin. In this small area of 69 km2, about 54 quarries and related cutting plants are concentrated. The impact assessment includes the following categories: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), and photochemical oxidation (POCP), following the CML-IA baseline 2007. Results: The results of the impact assessment for 1 m3 of marble tiles are 314.8 kg CO2eq of GWP, 1.19 kg SO2eq of AP, 0.073 g PO4 - -eq of EP, and 0.046 kg ethyleneeq of POCP. For slabs, the corresponding results were 200.1 kg CO2eq of GWP, 0.77 kg SO2eq of AP, 0.053 kg PO 4 - -eq of EP, and 0.029 kg ethyleneeq of POCP. The total embodied energy values of tiles and slabs are, respectively, 1,772 MJ/m 3 and 1,168 MJ/m3. This comparison shows that tiles manufacturing has higher values of embodied energy and environmental performance indicators. The value of the Custonaci slabs is reasonable compared to the Carrara marble (mainly slabs), and the embodied energy value of which is between 698 MJ/m3 and 1,414 MJ/m3. The main contribution to the energy consumption is due to electricity demand: 80% for tiles and 75% for slabs. Moreover, a comparison with the European type I Ecolabel criteria for natural hard floor coverings has been carried out to understand the range of the environmental impacts of Perlato di Sicilia compared to the thresholds reported in European Decision 272/2002. Conclusions, recommendations, and perspectives: This study is the first LCA of a typical Sicilian marble. The environmental interventions of the Custonaci marble appear to be slightly higher than Carrara marble. The nature of Custonaci marble and the technology involved in its production have reached the same performance level as in Carrara. Nevertheless, Custonaci marble is on the way to being an environmentally friendly product, as is shown by the comparison with Ecolabel criteria. The hot spots determined in this study are: the amount of spoils produced during the extraction step, the disposal of sludge resulting from cutting and finishing directly in the sawmill, the lack of the water recycling treatment in the quarry itself (as outlined in the European Ecolabel criteria), and the high electricity consumption. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Environmental performance; Floor tiles; LCA; LCI; Marble","ethylene; acidification; article; building material; controlled study; economic aspect; electricity; energy; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental management; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; Italy; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; performance; photooxidation; priority journal; sludge; statistical analysis",,"ethylene, 74-85-1",,,,"Alcorn, A., (2001) Embodied Energy and CO2 Coefficients for NY Building Materials, , Report series centre for building performance research report, ISBN 0-475-11099-4; Baldo, G.L., Rollino, S., Stimmeder, G., Fieschi, M., The use of LCA to develop eco-label criteria for hard floor coverings on behalf of the European flower (2002) Int J LCA, 7 (5), pp. 269-275. , 10.1007/BF02978886 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD38XnvVOmsbk%3D; Björklund, T.T., (1997) LCA of Building Frame Structures Environmental Impact over the Life Cycle of Wooden and Concrete Frames, , Technical Environmental Planning Report 1997:2 Chalmers University of Technology, Uppsala; Borgioli, L., Cremonesi, P., (2005) Le Resine Sintetiche Usate Nel Trattamento di Opere Policrome, , Il Prato ed Saonara; Consulting, B., (1993) The Boustead Model for Life-cycle Inventory Calculations-operating Manual, , Horsham West Sussex 1993; Bovea, M.-D., Saura, U., Ferrero, J.L., Giner, J., Cradle-to-gate study of red clay for use in the ceramic industry (2007) International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 12 (6), pp. 439-447. , DOI 10.1065/lca2006.06.252; (2000) Envest-environmental Impact Estimating Design Software.
