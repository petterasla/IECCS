These criteria constitute a highly developed, complex set of guidelines for project planning and evaluation. The level of development of these criteria and their long historical development from theoretical foundations must be taken into account in relating global climate change to possible changes in planning criteria. Second, the essentials of water project planning and evaluation, including benefit-cost principles and more complex concepts of social decision-making, are outlined. Third, the paper provides an overview of global climate change assessment methods, including impact assessment and integrated assessment, impact assessment uses a relatively straightforward comparison of with and without situations; integrated assessment attempts to improve on impact assessment by developing more complex models that incorporate a range of feedbacks and interrelationships.",,"climate change; methodological approach; water planning; water resource management; water resources; USA",,,,,,"Bergson, A., A reformulation of certain aspects of welfare economics (1938) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 52 (2), pp. 310-334; Brewer, G., Methods for Synthesis: Policy Exercises (1986) Sustainable Development of the Biosphere, , W.C.
