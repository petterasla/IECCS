Decade-long observations from SMMR onboard Nimbus-7 during 1978-1987 indicated significant long-term trends in sea ice cover over different regions of the southern polar ocean, in addition to the strong seasonal and interannual variability in various sea ice characteristics. In the post-SMMR era, passive microwave monitoring of the polar region has continued with the availability of SSM/I onboard DMSP series of satellites. With the launch of MSMR onboard India's OCEANSAT-1 in May 1999, an independent set of multi channel passive microwave observations of the Antarctic and Arctic sea ice have become available. In this paper, we present the analysis of the first two years of MSMR observed brightness temperatures to infer sea ice extent over the Antarctic region. The analysis brings out the characteristic seasonal variability of sea ice extents over different sectors of the Southern Polar Ocean. The annual average sea ice extent values esimated from MSMR for 1999-2001 for important regions, e.g. the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea sectors, are found to be significantly different compared to the average values observed through SMMR. The MSMR estimates suggest a continuation of the secular trends observed during the SMMR period. The trend in the sea ice extent over the Antarctic region as a whole was observed to be slightly positive (0.043 million km2 per year). The MSMR estimates of the sea ice extent over the entire Southern Ocean region, of 12.634 million km2 during 1999-2001, support the continuation of the secular increase observed during the SMMR as well as SSM/I periods. The observed increasing trend in sea ice extent derived from SMMR and MSMR data is discussed along with some more recent estimates derived from SSM/I measurements, with possible indications of an acceleration in time. In the current greenhouse induced global warming scenario, with amplified warming over the polar region, this represents an intriguing result requiring continued investigations.",,"Greenhouse effect; Microwave devices; Radiometers; Satellites; Polar regions; Sea ice; global warming; microwave radiometer; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; secular variation; spatial distribution; Southern Ocean",,,,,,"Bingham, A.W., Drinkwater, M.R., Recent changes in the microwave scattering properties of the Antarctic ice sheet (2000) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 38, pp. 1810-1816; Comiso, J.C., Variability and trends in Antarctic surface temperature from in situ and satellite infrared measurements (2000) Journal of Climate, 13, pp. 1674-1696; Gloersen, P., Campbell, W.J., Cavalier, D.J., Comiso, J.C., Parkinson, C.L., Zwally, H.J., (1992) Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice: 1978-1987, , NASA-SP-511; Eicken, H., Lemke, P., The response of polar sea ice to climate variability and change (2001) Climate of the 21st Century: Changes and Risks, pp. 206-211. , edited by J.
