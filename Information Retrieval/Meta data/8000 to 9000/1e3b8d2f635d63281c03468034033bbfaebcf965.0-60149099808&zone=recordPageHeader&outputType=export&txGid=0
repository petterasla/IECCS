Here we examine a diverse set of carnivore populations in search of patterns in body size change that could reflect global warming (in accord with Bergmann's rule). Location: Global. Methods: We used > 4400 specimens representing 22 carnivore species in 52 populations collected over the last few decades to examine whether size changed with collection date when geography and sex are accounted for. We then examined several factors related to global warming, body mass, diet, and the attributes of the different datasets, to see whether they affect the standardized slope (β) of the size versus time regression. Results: Six of 52 populations we examined show a significant effect of year of collection on body size at the 0.05 probability level. The response of size to global warming does not reflect spatial patterns of size variation, nor do diet or body mass affect tendency of populations to change in body size. Size changes are no more pronounced in populations that have been sampled more recently. However, change, where it occurs, is rapid. Main conclusions: There may be a tendency in the literature to report only cases where recent changes are prevalent. Although in our data only a minority of populations show body size changes, we may see changes accelerating in the future in response to more drastic climatic changes and other anthropogenic changes. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.","Bergmann's rule; Body size evolution; Carnivora; Evolutionary rates; Global change; Global warming; Publication bias","anthropogenic effect; Bergmann Rule; body mass; body size; carnivore; diet; environmental effect; global warming; population dynamics; regression analysis; vertebrate; Carnivora; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Baker, A.J., Moeed, A., Evolution in the introduced New Zealand populations of the common myna, Acridotheres tristis (Aves: Sturnidae) (1979) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 57, pp. 570-584; Blois, J.L., Feranec, R.S., Hadly, E.A., Environmental influences on spatial and temporal patterns of body-size variation in California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi (2008) Journal of Biogeography, 35, pp. 602-613; Cabin, R.J., Mitchell, R.J., To Bonferroni or not to Bonferroni: When and how are the questions (2000) Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America, 81, pp. 246-248; Chamaillé-Jammes, S., Massot, M., Aragon, P., Clobert, J., Global warming and positive fitness response in mountain populations of common lizards Lacerta vivipara (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 392-402; Clegg, S.M., Degnan, S.M., Moritz, C., Estoup, A., Kikkawa, J., Owens, I.P.F., Microevolution in island forms: The roles of drift and directional selection in morphological divergence of a passerine bird (2002) Evolution, 56, pp. 2090-2099; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioural Sciences, , 2nd edn Lawrence Elbaum Associates Hillsdale, New Jersey; Dayan, T., Simberloff, D., Size patterns among competitors: Ecological character displacement and character release in mammals, with special reference to island populations (1998) Mammal Review, 28, pp. 99-124; Dayan, T., Simberloff, D., Tchernov, E., Yom-Tov, Y., Calibrating the paleothermometer: Climate, communities, and the evolution of size (1991) Paleobiology, 17, pp. 189-199; Gingerich, P.D., Rates of evolution: Effects of time and temporal scaling (1983) Science, 222, pp. 159-161; Gould, S.J., Smooth curve of evolutionary rate: A psychological and mathematical artifact (1984) Science, 226, pp. 994-995; Haldane, J.B.S., Suggestions as to quantitative measurement of rates of evolution (1949) Evolution, 3, pp. 51-56; Järvinen, A., Global warming and egg size of birds (1994) Ecography, 17, pp. 108-110; Johnston, R.F., Selander, R.K., House sparrows: Rapid evolution of races in North America (1964) Science, 144, pp. 548-550; Kanuscak, P., Hromada, M., Tryjanowski, P., Sparks, T., Does climate at different scales influence the phenology and phenotype of the River Warbler Locustella fluviatilis?
