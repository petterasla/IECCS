During an experiment on winter wheat Triticum aestivum (cv. Mercia), the facility maintained mean daytime CO2 concentrations of 363 and 692 cm3 m-3 for targets of 350 and 700 cm3 m-3 respectively. Temperatures were set to follow outside ambient or outside ambient +4°C, and hourly means were within 0.5°C of the target for 92% of the time for target temperatures &gt;6°C. Total photosynthetically active radiation incident on the crop was 2% greater than the total measured outside over the same period. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; temperature; wheat; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027800275
