These mechanisms are each capable of only partially explaining observations. Transport within marine aerosols has been proposed and may explain transport over short distances but will contribute little over longer distances. However, PFO(A) has been shown to have a very short half-life in aqueous aerosols and thus sea spray was proposed as a mechanism for the generation of PFOA in the gas phase from PFO in a water body. Using the observed PFO concentrations in oceans of the Northern Hemisphere and estimated spray generation rates, this mechanism is shown to have the potential for contributing large amounts of PFOA to the atmosphere and may therefore contribute significantly to the concentrations observed in remote locations. Specifically, the rate of PFOA release into the gas phase from oceans in the Northern Hemisphere is calculated to be potentially comparable to global stack emissions to the atmosphere. The subsequent potential for atmospheric degradation of PFOA and its global warming potential are considered. Observed isomeric ratios and predicted atmospheric concentrations due to FTOH degradation are used to elucidate the likely relative importance of transport pathways. It is concluded that gas phase PFOA released from oceans may help to explain observed concentrations in remote regions. The model calculations performed in the present study strongly suggest that oceanic aerosol and gas phase field monitoring is of vital importance to obtain a complete understanding of the global dissemination of PFCAs. © 2010 SETAC.","Aqueous aerosol; Global warming potential; Long-range transport; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Sea spray","Aqueous aerosols; Global warming potential; Long range transport; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Sea spray; Acids; Air pollution; Atmospheric aerosols; Concentration (process); Degradation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Ocean currents; Atmospheric movements; fluorine; methyl chloride; perfluoro compound; perfluorocarboxylic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; carboxylic acid; global warming; marine atmosphere; Northern Hemisphere; pollutant transport; aerosol; air pollution; aqueous solution; atmosphere; greenhouse effect; priority journal; review; Aerosols; Air Movements; Atmosphere; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Seawater; Steam; Water Pollutants; Arctic",,"fluorine, 7782-41-4; methyl chloride, 74-87-3; perfluorooctanoic acid, 335-67-1; Aerosols; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Steam; Water Pollutants",,,,"Prevedouros, K., Cousins, I.T., Buck, R.C., Korzeniowski, S.H., Sources, fate and transport of perfluorocarboxylates (2006) Environ Sci Technol, 40, pp. 32-44; Houde, M., Martin, J.W., Letcher, R.J., Solomon, K.R., Muir, D.C.G., Biological monitoring of polyfluorinated substances:A review (2006) Environ Sci Technol, 40, pp. 3463-3473; Fei, C., McLaughlin, J.K., Lipworth, L., Olsen, J., Maternal levels of perfluorinated chemicals and subfecundity (2009) Hum Reprod, 24, pp. 1200-1205; Joensen, U.N., Bossi, R., Leffers, H., Jensen, A.A., Skakkebæk, N.E., Jørgensen, N., Do perfluoroalkyl compounds impair human semen quality?
