There are two main aims of the paper: (1) to estimate how solar activity influences on galactic CR long-term variations, what are the relative role in this influence of convection-diffusion modulation and drift modulation and (2) to estimate the expected part of global climate change which may be caused by the influence of solar activity cycle on climate through 11- and 22-year cosmic ray variations. © 2005.","Climate change; Clouds; Cosmic rays; Long-term variation","Climate change; Cloud chambers; Diffusion; Solar radiation; Space research; Drift modulation; galactic cosmic ray intensity; Long-term variation; Cosmic rays",,,,,,"Ardanuy, P.E., Stowe, L.L., Gruber, A., Weiss, M., Shortwave, longwave and net cloud-radiative forcing as determined from NIMBUS-7 observations (1991) J.
