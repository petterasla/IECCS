During the second growing season the photosynthetic characteristics of Phragmites leaves were evaluated under controlled conditions for each site, each population, and their interaction, and related to tissue nutrient and pigment content. The light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (Pmax), dark respiration rate (Rd), light compensation point (Ic), and apparent quantum efficiency (φi) were significantly affected by growth site, whereas differences between populations were less pronounced. Plants grown in the more northerly climates appeared to be more photosynthetically limited through lower Pmax values and lower φi levels, reflecting phenotypic acclimation to the lower summer temperatures and irradiance levels at the northern growth sites. The higher Pmax levels in the southern climate were correlated with higher nutrient levels in the tissue of leaves. The study shows that the four genetically distinct populations of P australis exhibited high phenotypic plasticity in photosynthetic response to climatic change. The degree of photosynthetic plasticity within P australia genotypes is large, and generally larger than the genetically determined differences between European populations. The results are discussed in relation to the prospected global climate change. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Acclimation; Climate; Clone; Genotypes; Light compensation point; Pmax; Photosynthesis; Plasticity; Quantum efficiency; Reed; Respiration; Wetland","adaptation; climate; growth response; interpopulation variation; phenotypic plasticity; photosynthesis; climate; conference paper; Czech Republic; Denmark; environmental parameters; Europe; geography; global climate; Netherlands; photosynthesis; Phragmites australis; plant; plant growth; plant leaf; quantum mechanics; season; Spain; temperature acclimatization; wetland; Europe; Phragmites; Phragmites australis",,,,,,"Amthor, J.S., The role of maintenance respiration in plant growth (1984) Plant Cell Environ., 7, pp. 561-569; Amthor, J.S., Respiration in a future, higher-CO2 world (1991) Plant Cell Environ., 14, pp. 13-20; Berner, R.A., A model for atmospheric CO2 over phanerozoic time (1991) Am.
