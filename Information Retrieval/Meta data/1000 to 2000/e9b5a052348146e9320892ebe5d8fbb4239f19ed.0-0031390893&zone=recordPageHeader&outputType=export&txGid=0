Climate changes induced by the doubling of atmospheric CO2 have been predicted for the yr 2050 by general circulation models (GCMs) and energy balance models (EBMs). The results obtained suggest that potential changes in air temperature and precipitation may have a dramatic impact on the pattern and magnitude of runoff, on soil moisture and evaporation, as well as on the aridity level of some hydrologic zones of Mexico. However, in other cases climate change is likely to produce a positive effect. Indices were estimated for quantifying the vulnerability of hydrologic regions and of the country as a whole. These vulnerability indices were defined according to criteria previously established for studies of this type. The indices provide information about both the hydrologic zones which are vulnerable even under current climate conditions and others which may be vulnerbale to future climate changes.",,"carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; developing country; nature-society relations; river basin; thermal balance; vulnerability assessment; water resources; Mexico",,,,,,,"Mendoza, V.M.; Ctr de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, Univ Nac Autonoma de Mexico, Circiuto Exterior, Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico 04510, Mexico",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031390893
