This paper explores how the changing climate is likely to affect oil and gas operations in low-lying coastal areas and the outer continental shelf. Oil and gas production in these regions comprises a large sector of the economies of many energy producing nations. Six key climate change drivers in coastal and marine regions are characterized with respect to oil and gas development: changes in carbon dioxide levels and ocean acidity, air and water temperature, precipitation patterns, the rate of sea level rise, storm intensity, and wave regime. These key drivers have the potential to independently and cumulatively affect coastal and offshore oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation, and several impacts of climate change have already been observed in North America. © 2011.","Climate change; Coastal infrastructure; Oil and gas development","Changing climate; Coastal area; Coastal infrastructure; Continental shelves; Earth's climate; Global climate changes; Marine region; Offshore oil; Oil and gas; Oil and gas development; Oil and gas operations; Oil and gas production; Precipitation patterns; Sea level rise; Storm intensity; Water temperatures; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coastal zones; Earth (planet); Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Gases; Global warming; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum deposits; Petroleum transportation; Sea level; Petroleum prospecting; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; coastal engineering; continental shelf; gas field; gas production; global change; hydrocarbon exploration; offshore structure; oil field; oil production; North America",,,,,,"Ahmad, F., Rauch, S., Hodor, M., Oil and gas development in the Arctic Ocean (2009) Sea Technology, 50 (40), pp. 51-55; Allan, J.C., Komar, P.D., Climate controls on U.S. West Coast erosion processes (2006) Journal of Coastal Research, 22 (3), pp. 511-529; Andersson, A.J., Mackenzie, F.T., Ver, L.M., Solution of shallow-water carbonates: an insignificant buffer against rising atmospheric CO2 (2003) Geology, 31, pp. 513-516; Archer, D., Methane hydrate stability and anthropogenic climate change (2007) Biogeosciences, 4, pp. 521-544; Boesch, D.F., Coles, V.J., Kimmel, D.G., Miller, W.D., Coastal dead zones and global climate change: ramifications of climate change for Chesapeake Bay hypoxia (2007) Regional Impacts of Climate Change: Four Case Studies in the United States., pp. 57-70. , Pew Center for Global Climate Change, Arlington, VA; Burkett, V.R., Wilcox, D.A., Stottlemeyer, R., Barrow, W., Fagre, D., Baron, J., Price, J., Doyle, T., Nonlinear dynamics in ecosystem response to climatic change: case studies and policy implications (2005) Ecological Complexity, 2, pp. 357-394; Burkett, V., Fernandez, L., Nicholls, R., Woodroffe, C., Climate change impacts on coastal biodiversity (2009) Climate Change and Biodiversity in the Americas, pp. 167-194. , Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; Environment Canada, Ontario, A.
