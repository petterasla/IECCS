Both of these phenomena occurred while a significant warming took place in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs), thus sparking a debate on whether the warming is a consequence of natural climate variations, anthropogenic forcing, or both; and if both, what their relative roles are. Here models and observations are used to detect and attribute long-term (multidecadal) twentieth-century North Atlantic (NA) SST changes to their anthropogenic and natural causes. A suite of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) twentieth-century (C20C) coupled model simulations with multiple ensemble members and a signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal function analysis are used to identify a model-based estimate of the forced, anthropogenic component in NA SST variability. Comparing the results to observations, it is argued that the long-term, observed, North Atlantic basin-averaged SSTs combine a forced global warming trend with a distinct, local multidecadal ""oscillation"" that is outside of the range of the model-simulated, forced component and most likely arose from internal variability. This internal variability produced a cold interval between 1900 and 1930, followed by 30 yr of relative warmth and another cold phase from 1960 to 1990, and a warming since then. This natural variation, referred to previously as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), thus played a significant role in the twentieth-century NA SST variability and should be considered in future, near-term climate projections as a mechanism that, depending on its behavior, can act either constructively or destructively with the region's response to anthropogenic influence, temporarily amplifying or mitigating regional climate change. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Anthropogenic components; Anthropogenic forcing; Anthropogenic influences; Atlantic hurricanes; Atlantic multidecadal oscillations; Climate projections; Climate variations; Coupled models; Empirical orthogonal function analysis; Ensemble members; Forced components; Greenland Ice sheets; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Internal variabilities; Model-based; Natural variations; North atlantic; Regional climate changes; Signal to noise; Climatology; Fourier analysis; Global warming; Seawater; Submarine geophysics; Atmospheric temperature; atmospheric forcing; climate change; climate variation; decomposition analysis; global warming; hurricane; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; sea surface temperature; twentieth century; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Smith, L.A., Optimal filtering in singular spectrum analysis (1997) Phys.
