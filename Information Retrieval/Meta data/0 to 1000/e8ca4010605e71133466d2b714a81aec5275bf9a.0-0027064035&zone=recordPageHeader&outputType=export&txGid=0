Introduced weedy species, such as Tanacetum vulgare L., had up to a 10-fold greater emergence at high temperature (30°C for 18 h with light, 15°C for 6 h in the dark) than at low temperature (20/10°C). Seedling emergence of native weedy species, such as Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) Beauv., was 1.5-3 times greater at low temperature. Other native weedy species, such as Rubus idaeus L., emerged only from samples at low temperature. Emergence of native non-weedy species was greatest at high temperature, even though mature plants of species such as Ranunculus hyperboreus Rottb. and Carex eburnea Boott are normally found in cool and moist habitats. Of those species expected to persist in warm and dry habitats, only introduced weedy species showed consistent and significantly greater seedling emergence at high temperature. It is hypothesized, therefore, that the abundance of introduced weedy species would increase in disturbed or sparsely vegetated zones around water bodies as these zones become dry and warm with climate change. © 1992.",,"boreal; climatic change; seedling emergence; temperature; wetland; Canada, Alberta, Peace-Athabasca Delta; Calamagrostis canadensis; Carex eburnea; Ranunculaceae; Ranunculus hyperboreus; Rubus idaeus; Tanacetum vulgare",,,,,,"(1983) Weeds of Alberta, p. 209. , Anonymous, Alberta Agriculture and Alberta Environmental Centre, Edmonton, Alberta, Agdex 640-4; Bonan, Shugart, Environmental factors and ecological processes in boreal forests (1989) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 20, pp. 1-28; Dirschl, Dabbs, Gentle, Landscape classification and plant successional trends in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (1974) Rep.
