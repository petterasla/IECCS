In other places any manifestation of poverty is a challenge to move forward but in Africa, the reverse is the case. Therefore the continent and international community are not happy about it, hence various programmes and strategies were put in place. Ironically there is little to show for it. For instance, about ten years before the end of millennium, the common slogan in Africa was 'water for all, food for all, education for all, health for all and so on by the year 2000'. The 'miracle' year 2000 has come and gone and water, food, education and health are not enjoyed by many citizens of the continent. Development is still illusive. In this paper I examine the issues of poverty and development in the context of deforestation/biodiversity a consequent effect of global warming being one of the major threats to humanity. Some questions are raised with a view to proffer recommendations that may move the continent forward. These are: What are the roots of poverty in Africa? Why should there be a symbiotic relationship between poverty and development in Africa? Can Africa really develop?.","Development; Environment; Population; Poverty; Sustainable development; Symbiotic relationship","Africa; article; biodiversity; community care; community program; deforestation; economic development; ecosystem; education; environmental change; environmental management; environmental protection; government regulation; greenhouse effect; health care access; health care quality; health program; human rights; law enforcement; nutritional status; pollution control; poverty; quality of life; sustainable development; symbiosis; water supply",,,,,,"Ako, R.T., (2005) An Appraisal of the Recognition and Enforcement of Environmental Human Rights for the Sustainable Development of the Niger Delta, An, pp. 56-70. , M.Phil Thesis submitted to Obafemi Awolowo University.pp; Cairncross, el la, S., The Urban Context (1990) The Poor Die Young: Housing and Health in the Third World, pp. 1-24. , Cairncross, S, Hardoy, J.
