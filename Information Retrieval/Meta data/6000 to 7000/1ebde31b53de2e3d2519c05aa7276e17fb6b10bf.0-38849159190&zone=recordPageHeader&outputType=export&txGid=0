It must be manufactured from water with either fossil or nonfossil energy sources. Widespread use of hydrogen as an energy source could improve global climate change, energy efficiency, and air quality. The thermochemical conversion processes, such as pyrolysis, gasification, and steam gasification are available for converting the biomass to a more useful energy. The yield from steam gasification increases with increasing water-to-sample ratio. The yields of hydrogen from the pyrolysis and the steam gasification increase with increase of temperature. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells are an important enabling technology for the hydrogen future and more efficient alternatives to the combustion of gasoline and other fossil fuels. Hydrogen has the potential to solve two major energy problems: reducing dependence on petroleum and reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.","Biohydrogen; Biomass; Thermochemical conversion","Biomass; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen; Thermochemistry; Wastes; Biohydrogen; Steam gasification; Thermochemical conversion; Biofuels",,,,,,"Aiba, S., Humphrey, A.E., Milis, N.F., (1973) Biochemical Engineering, , 2nd ed.
