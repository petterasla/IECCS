An alternative method to overcome this problem is natural ventilation. The proper design of natural ventilation must be based on detailed understanding of airflow within enclosed spaces, governed by pressure differences due to wind and buoyancy forces. In the present study, natural cross-ventilation with openings at non-symmetrical locations is examined experimentally in a test chamber and numerically using advanced computational fluid dynamics techniques. The experimental part consisted of temperature and velocity measurements at strategically selected locations in the chamber, during noon and afternoon hours of typical summer days. External weather conditions were recorded by a weather station at the chamber's site. The computational part of the study consisted of the steady-state application of three Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models modified to account for both wind and buoyancy effects: the standard k-ε, the RNG k-ε and the so-called ""realizable"" k-ε models. Two computational domains were used, corresponding to each recorded wind incidence angle. It is concluded that all turbulence models applied agree relatively well with the experimental measurements. The indoor thermal environment was also studied using two thermal comfort models found in literature for the estimation of thermal comfort under high-temperature experimental conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
