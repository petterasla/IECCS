Pt content varies between 393 and 786 ppm throughout the loess-paleosol sequence, and is generally higher in the loess than in interstratified paleosols, showing fluctuation cycles of 100 ka in correspondence to loess-paleosol alternations. Pt variations on a carbonate-free basis in the loess-paleosol sequence could indicate variations in atmosphere precipitation resulting in different leaching loss of P from paleosols. Pi has an average value of 499 ppm with a range of 324-560 ppm, accounting for more than 70% of Pt in the S0-L1-S1 sequence, where the minimum of Pi in the Malan loess is higher than the maximum of Pi in S1. Po ranges between 59 and 233 ppm with an average of 132 ppm in the S0- L1-S1 sequence. Phosphorus (P) was initially delivered to the Luochuan loess section via influx of aeolian dust from the northern desert and Gobi areas by the East Asian winter monsoon, and then was modified by pedogenesis associated with the East Asian summer monsoon during the last 130 ka. ""Preserved Pt"" in the loess L1 is tightly correlated with grain size without leaching loss of P due to enrichment of P in fine-grained fractions, as well as ""initial Pt"". ""Leaching Pt"" data show that paleosol S1 had lost 15-40% of its ""initial Pt"", and that there was much more precipitation in S1 than in L1. Pi subject to slightly weak pedogenesis was completely transformed into Po without leaching loss of P in loess L1. By contrast, much Pi disappeared from paleosol S1 due to strong pedogenesis, partly through leaching and partly through conversion to organic forms during P cycling processes. Po variation is similar to those of MS and the &lt;7.8 μm fraction in L1, but contains more information on the East Asian winter monsoon due to weak pedogenesis without leaching of P. Po in S1 lower than L1SS1 as a consequence of strong decomposition of the organic matter kept constantly in the middle of S1 where Pi kept at the lowest of 423 ppm, suggesting that there existed a very warm and humid climate related to the enhanced summer monsoon during that period. The mean organic P/inorganic P ratio (Po/Pi) is lower in the L1LL1 and L1LL2 than in the S0, S1 and L1SS1, indicating that low Po/Pi ratios coincide with weak weathering-pedogenesis, and higher Po/Pi ratios correspond to strong weathering-pedogenesis. Po/Pi ratio can eliminate the effect of grain size on aeolian dust because of chemical uniformity of aeolian dust and enrichment of Po and Pi in the fine-grained fractions. Thus, Po/ Pi ratio is solely linked to pedogenesis of the Luochuan loess section. Variation in Po/Pi ratio is similar to those of MS and the Marine Oxygen Isotope composition, indicating the summer monsoon evolution during the last 130 ka and providing the biogeochemical evidence for further understanding the genetic links between the East Asian monsoon and global climate change. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.
