However, as revealed due to hurricane Ivan in 2004, the current roofing systems of the houses are particularly vulnerable. In other parts of the world ferrocement roofing is a technically and economically viable solution but for acceptance in the Caribbean, the aesthetic factor controls the roof design in terms of topology prompting a new innovative solution. Load test data is also required by the approving agencies of the various jurisdictions in the Caribbean. The results of structural testing of the full-scale main components of a proposed ferrocement roof system are presented. This comprises of a 9.0 m wide and 2.5 m high pitched-portal frame of channel-section with bolted steel connections; a 6.10 m hollow-section roof slab in bending, and slab-to-frame bolted connections in pullout. It was found that the performance of the elements is consistent with the acknowledged beneficial behavior of ferrocement, and the proposed ferrocement roof system should adequately address the loading conditions expected in the Caribbean. The data can also be used to determine safe spans of the proposed roof system for application in other regions as well. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
