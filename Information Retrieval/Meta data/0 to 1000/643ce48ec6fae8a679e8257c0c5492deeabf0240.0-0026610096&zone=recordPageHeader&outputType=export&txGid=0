In Los Angeles the continued severity of the air pollution problem has stimulated renewed efforts to significantly curtail emissions to meet the health-related air quality standards. This paper provides an overview of the ambient air quality in Los Angeles, the impact of previous emissions control strategies, and the additional reduction in emissions required to meet the health-related air quality standards (Air Quality Management Plan, 1991) The paper focuses upon the role of clean technologies such as the fuel cell to effect the emissions reductions required. Finally, there is a discussion of the demonstration programs, planned or underway, with fuel cells and related technologies in the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), followed by some comments on the regulatory and legislative actions underway to stimulate new technologies. © 1992.",,"Air Pollution--Legislation; Air Pollution - California; Air Pollution - Particulate Emissions; Fuel Cells - Applications; Fuel Cells - Environmental Impact; Clean Fuels; Emission Control; Proton Exchange Membranes (PEM); California Clean Air Initiatives; South Coast Air Quality Management District; Fuel Cells; Air Pollution",,,,,,"(1991) Air Quality Management Plan; Seinfeld, (1989) Science, 243, p. 745; Finlayson-Pitts, Pitts, Jr., (1986) Atmospheric Chemistry, , Wiley, New York; (1991) Lancet, 338, p. 8761. , (July 27); Heywood, (1990) Soichiro Honda Lecturer; California Air Resources Board, Regulations for low-emission vehicles and clean fuels (1990) Staff Rep.; Kreucher, Auto-oil program and clean air act implications (1991) SAE Alternative Liquid Transportation Fuels TOPTEC, Dearborn, MI; Wang, DeLuchi, Sperling, (1990) J.
