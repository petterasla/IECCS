From 1991 to 1999, we measured gas fluxes and other sources of global warming potential (GWP) in cropped and nearby unmanaged ecosystems. Net GWP (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per square meter per year) ranged from 110 in our conventional tillage systems to -211 in early successional communities. None of the annual cropping systems provided net mitigation, although soil carbon accumulation in no-till systems came closest to mitigating all other sources of GWP. In all but one ecosystem, nitrous oxide production was the single greatest source of GWP. In the late successional system, GWP was neutral because of significant methane oxidation. These results suggest additional Opportunities for lessening the GWP of agronomic systems.",,"carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; agricultural practice; carbon dioxide; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; radiative forcing; agriculture; article; atmosphere; carbon dioxide measurement; crop; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; oxidation; priority journal; radiation",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"Prather, M., , pp. 73-126. , Climate Change 1994, J.
