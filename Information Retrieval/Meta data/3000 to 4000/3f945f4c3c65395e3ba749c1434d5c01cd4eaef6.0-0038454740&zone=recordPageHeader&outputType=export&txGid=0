Impacts of global warming, which is generally perceived as the most serious threat to coral reefs today, often coincide with various common anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution and overharvesting. To better evaluate the impact of global warming, interactions between elevated temperature and background disturbance should be investigated. In this study, the physiological response of the reef-building coral Porites cylindrica was investigated, when exposed to enrichment of dissolved inorganic nitrate (+ 15 μM for 14 days) and elevated seawater temperature (+ 2°C for 48 h), in the absence of particulate food. It was shown that P. cylindrica was able to tolerate the temperature exposure without losing symbiotic microalgae or chlorophyll pigments, although the photosynthetic capacity was affected. Nitrate enrichment significantly reduced primary production rate, although zooxanthella population density and chlorophyll concentrations were not affected. The combination of elevated temperature and nitrate enrichment produced an even more pronounced reduction of the production rate. Since coral respiration rate remained unaffected by the treatments, this implies that the corals were unable to acclimate to impaired photosynthesis. However, there was no indication of subsequently reduced tissue growth or increased host catabolism based on tissue biomass measurements. On the other hand, all corals, including controls, lost tissue biomass during the exposure, suggesting a dependence on particulate food. Our results imply that corals on nutrient-exposed reefs may be more stressed during periods of elevated temperature, compared to corals in more pristine areas.",,"coral; ecological impact; food availability; global warming; nitrate; nutrient enrichment; physiological response; water temperature; Anthozoa; Porites; Porites cylindrica; Scleractinia",,,,,,"Abramovitch-Gottlib, L., Katoshevski, D., Vargo, R., A computerized tank for studying the effects of temperature on calcification of reef organisms (2002) J Biochem Biophys Methods, 50, pp. 245-252; Alutoin, S., Boberg, J., Nyström, M., Tedengren, M., Effects of the multiple stressors copper and reduced salinity on the metabolism of the hermatypic coral Porites lutea (2001) Mar Environ Res, 52, pp. 289-299; Ambariyanto, Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Nutrient enrichment and the ultrastructure of zooxanthellae from the giant clam Tridacna maxima (1996) Mar Biol, 125, pp. 359-363; Berkelmans, R., Oliver, J.K., Large-scale bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef (1999) Coral Reefs, 18, pp. 55-60; Berner, T., Izhaki, I., Effect of exogenous nitrogen levels on ultrastructure of zooxanthellae from the hermatypic coral Pocillopora damicornis (1994) Pac Sci, 48, pp. 254-262; Brown, B.E., Dunne, R.P., Goodson, M.S., Douglas, A.E., Bleaching patterns in reef corals (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 142-143; Bythell, J.C., Nutrient uptake in the reef-building coral Acropora palmata at natural environmental concentrations (1990) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 68, pp. 65-69; Dubinsky, Z., Jokiel, P.L., Ratio of energy and nutrient fluxes regulates symbiosis between zooxanthellae and corals (1994) Pac Sci, 48, pp. 313-324; Dubinsky, Z., Stambler, N., Ben-Zion, M., McClosky, L.R., Muscatine, L., Falkowski, P.G., The effect of external nutrient resources on the optical properties and photosynthetic efficiency of Stylophora pistillata (1990) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 239, pp. 231-246; Dunne, R.P., Brown, B.E., The influence of solar radiation on bleaching of shallow water reef corals in the Andaman Sea, 1993-1998 (2001) Coral Reefs, 20, pp. 201-210; Falkowski, P.G., Dubinsky, Z., Muscatine, L., McCloskey, L., Population controls in symbiotic corals (1993) BioScience, 43, pp. 606-611; Ferrier, M.D., Net uptake of dissolved free amino acids by four scleractinian corals (1991) Coral Reefs, 10, pp. 183-187; Ferrier-Pagès, C., Gattuso, J.-P., Dallot, S., Jaubert, J., Effect of nutrient enrichment on growth and photosynthesis of the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata (2000) Coral Reefs, 19, pp. 103-113; Ferrier-Pagès, C., Schoelzke, V., Jaubert, J., Muscatine, L., Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Response of a scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata, to iron and nitrate enrichment (2001) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 259, pp. 249-261; Fitt, W.K., Cook, C.B., The effects of feeding or addition of dissolved inorganic nutrients in maintaining the symbiosis between dinoflagellates and a tropical marine cnidarian (2001) Mar Biol, 139, pp. 507-517; Fitt, W.K., Brown, B.E., Warner, M.E., Dunne, R.P., Coral bleaching: Interpretation of thermal tolerance limits and thermal thresholds in tropical corals (2001) Coral Reefs, 20, pp. 51-65; Gardella, D.J., Edmunds, P.J., The oxygen microenvironment adjacent to the tissue of the scleractinian Dichocoenia stokesii and its effects on symbiont metabolism (1999) Mar Biol, 135, pp. 289-295; Gates, R.D., Edmunds, P.J., The physiological mechanisms of acclimatization in tropical corals (1999) Am Zool, 39, pp. 30-43; Goreau, T., McClanahan, T., Hayes, R., Strong, A., Conservation of coral reefs after the 1998 global bleaching event (2000) Conserv Biol, 14, pp. 5-15; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Population dynamics of zooxanthellae in the coral Pocillopora damicornis exposed to elevated ammonium [(NH4)2SO4] concentrations (1994) Pac Sci, 48, pp. 263-272; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Smith, G.J., Influence of the population density of zooxanthellae and supply of ammonium on the biomass and metabolic characteristics of the reef corals Seriatophora hystrix and Stylophora pistillata (1989) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 57, pp. 173-186; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Williamson, J., Availability of two forms of dissolved nitrogen to the coral Pocillopora damicornis and its symbiotic zooxanthellae (1999) Mar Biol, 133, pp. 561-570; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Takabayashi, M., Moreno, G., The impact of long-term nutrient enrichment on coral calcification and growth (1997) Proceedings of the 8th International Coral Reef Symposium, 1, pp. 861-866. , Lessios HA, MacIntyre IG (eds).
