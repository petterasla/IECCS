A reduced-form hydrological model for flood prediction and a downscaling approach suitable for integrated assessment modeling are presented. Based on these components, the fraction of world population living in river basins affected by changes in flooding probability in the course of climate change is determined. This is then used as a climate impact response function in order to derive emission corridors limiting the population affected. This approach illustrates the consideration of probabilistic impacts within the framework of the tolerable windows approach. Based on the change in global mean temperature, as calculated by the simple climate models used in integrated assessment, spatially resolved changes in climatic variables are determined using pattern scaling, while natural variability in these variables is considered using twentieth century deviations from the climatology. Driven by the spatially resolved climate change, the hydrological model then aggregates these changes to river basin scale. The hydrological model is subjected to a sensitivity analysis with regard to the water balance, and the uncertainty arising through the different projections of changes in mean climate by differing climate models is considered by presenting results based on different models. The results suggest that up to 20% of world population live in river basins that might inevitably be affected by increased flood events in the course of global warming, depending on the climate model used to estimate the regional distribution of changes in climate. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Catchments; Floods; Hydraulic models; Hydrology; Probability; Climate impact response functions; Flooding probability; Global mean temperature; Hydrological models; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; environmental assessment; flooding; global warming; probability; river basin",,,,,,"Adam, J.C., Lettenmaier, D.P., Adjustment of global gridded precipitation for systematic bias (2003) J Geophys Res, 108 (D9), p. 4257; (1998) Global change scenarios of the 21st century, , Alcamo J, Leemans R, Kreileman E eds, Elsevier, Oxford, UK; Alcamo, J., Endejan, M.B., Kaspar, F., Rösch, T., The GLASS model: A strategy for quantifying global environmental security (2001) Environ Sci Policy, 4 (1), pp. 1-12; Arnell, N.W., Climate change and global water resources (1999) Glob Environ Change, 9 (S1), pp. S31-S49; Arnell, N.W., A simple water balance model for the simulation of streamflow over a large geographic domain (1999) J Hydrol, 217 (3-4), pp. 314-335; Arora, V.K., Boer, G.J., Effects of simulated climate change on the hydrology of major river basins (2001) J Geophys Res, 106 (D4), pp. 3335-3348; Berz, G., Catastrophes and climate change: Concerns and possible countermeasures of the insurance industry (1999) Mitig Adapt Strategies Glob Chang, 4 (3-4), pp. 283-293; http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ ds552.1, Bodo BA (2001a) Monthly discharge data for world rivers excluding former Soviet Union, Version 1.3, available online athttp://dss.ucar.edu/ datasets/ds553.2, Bodo BA (2001b) Monthly discharges for 2400 rivers and streams of the former Soviet Union.
