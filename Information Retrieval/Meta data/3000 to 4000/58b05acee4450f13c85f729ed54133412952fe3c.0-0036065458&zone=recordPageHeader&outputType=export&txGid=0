Evidence of a statistically reliable effect of solar activity on the variations in the CO2 content in the lower atmosphere has been presented, and the global increase in CO2, depending on the GCR flux and solar activity, is explained. © 2002 by MAIK ""Nauka/Interperiodica"" (Russia).",,"carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); solar activity",,,,,,"Bach, W., Crane, A.J., Carbon dioxide: Current views and developments in energy (1982) Climate Res., p. 16; Butcher, S.S., Charlson, J.R., (1972) an Introduction to Air Chemistry, , New York: Univ.
