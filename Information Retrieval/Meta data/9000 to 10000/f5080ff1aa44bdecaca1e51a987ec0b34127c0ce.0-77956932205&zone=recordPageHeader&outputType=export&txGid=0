Here, we investigate the evolutionary and historical contributions to the gradient of increasing species richness with topographic complexity. We analysed a dataset of 418 fossil rodent species from western North America spanning 25 to 5Ma.We compared diversification histories between tectonically active (IntermontaneWest) and quiescent (Great Plains) regions. Although diversification histories differed between the two regions, species richness, origination rate and extinction rate per million years were not systematically different over the 20 Myr interval. In the tectonically active region, the greatest increase in originations coincided with a Middle Miocene episode of intensified tectonic activity and global warming. During subsequent global cooling, species richness declined in the montane region and increased on the Great Plains. These results suggest that interactions between tectonic activity and climate change stimulate diversification in mammals. The elevational diversity gradient characteristic of modern mammalian faunas was not a persistent feature over geologic time. Rather, the Miocene rodent record suggests that the elevational diversity gradient is a transient feature arising during particular episodes of Earth's history. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Diversification; Diversity gradient; Macroevolution; Rodentia","climate change; data set; evolutionary biology; fossil record; macroecology; mammal; Miocene; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; rodent; species diversity; species richness; animal; biodiversity; climate change; conference paper; fossil; geography; history; mammal; North America; population dynamics; species differentiation; species extinction; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Extinction, Biological; Fossils; Genetic Speciation; Geography; History, Ancient; Mammals; North America; Population Dynamics; Mammalia; Rodentia",,,,,,"Badgley, C., Tectonics, topography, and mammalian diversity Ecography, , press; Badgley, C., Fox, D.L., Ecological biogeography of North American mammals: Species density and ecological structure in relation to environmental gradients (2000) Journal of Biogeography, 27 (6), pp. 1437-1467. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00498.x; Barnosky, A.D., Carrasco, M.A., Effects of Oligo-Miocene global climate changes on mammalian species richness in the northwestern quarter of the USA (2002) Evol.
