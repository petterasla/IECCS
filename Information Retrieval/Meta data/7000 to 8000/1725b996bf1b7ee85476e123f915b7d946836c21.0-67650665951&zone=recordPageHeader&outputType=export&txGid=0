Here, we describe the modeling of a biotrickling filtration system composed of methane-consuming bacteria, i.e., methanotrophs, to assess the utility of these systems in removing methane from the atmosphere. Model results indicate that assuming the global average atmospheric concentration of methane, 1.7 ppmv, methane removal is ineffective using these methanotrophic biofilters as the methane concentration is too low to enable cell survival. If the concentration is increased to 500-6,000 ppmv, however, similar to that found above landfills and in concentrated animal feeding operations (factory farms), 4.98-35.7 tons of methane can be removed per biofilter per year assuming biotrickling filters of typical size (3.66 m in diameter and 11.5 m in height). Using reported ranges of capital, operational, and maintenance costs, the cost of the equivalent ton of CO2 removal using these systems is $90-$910 ($2,070-$20,900 per ton of methane), depending on the influent concentration of methane and if heating is required. The use of methanotrophic biofilters for controlling methane emissions is technically feasible and, provided that either the costs of biofilter construction and operation are reduced or the value of CO2 credits is increased, can also be economically attractive. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Biofilm; Biofiltration; Biotrickling filter; Methane; Methanotroph","Atmospheric concentration; Atmospheric methanes; Biotrickling; Biotrickling filter; Biotrickling filters; Cell survival; Concentrated animal feeding operations; Concentration of; Filtration systems; Global warming potential; Maintenance cost; Methane concentrations; Methane emissions; Methanotroph; Methanotrophs; Model results; Atmospheric chemistry; Biofilms; Biofiltration; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Cell membranes; Concentration (process); Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Maintenance; Methanation; Methane; Biofilters; methane; atmospheric chemistry; bacterium; biofilm; biofiltration; concentration (composition); emission control; greenhouse gas; methane; methanotrophy; microbial activity; pollutant removal; air pollution; animal food; article; biofilter; cell survival; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heating; landfill; methanotroph; trickling filter; Air Pollutants; Autotrophic Processes; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Remediation; Methane; Methylosinus trichosporium; Micropore Filters; Animalia",,"methane, 74-82-8; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Aizpuru, A., Khammar, N., Malhautier, L., Fanlo, J.L., Biofiltration for the treatment of complex mixtures of VOC influence of the packing material (2003) Acta Biotechnologica, 23 (2-3), pp. 211-226; Alonso, C., Suidan, M.T., Sorial, G.A., Lee Smith, F., Biswas, P., Smith, P.J., Brenner, R.C., Gas treatment in trickle-bed biofilters: Biomass, how much is enough?
