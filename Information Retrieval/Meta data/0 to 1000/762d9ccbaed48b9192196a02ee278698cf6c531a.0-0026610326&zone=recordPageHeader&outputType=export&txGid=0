These are undertaken in order to assess the impact an organisation's activities have on the environment and should include obtaining estimates for the airborne pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions produced. Recommendations are normally made to lessen detrimental effects on the environment and these aims are increasingly incorporated in organisations' environment policies. Reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and improving corporate profitability can be mutually compatible. Estimating emissions from multi-site organisations (as part of a corporate environmental audit) can be a difficult and lengthy task. The present paper describes a computer model, which has been developed to estimate corporate greenhouse-gas and airborne-pollutant emissions from readily-available fuel-invoice information and/or plant details. How monitoring and targeting techniques, developed for energy-thrift campaigns, can be used to monitor and reduce corporate greenhouse-gas emissions, with little or no capital outlay, by reducing energy waste, are also described. © 1992.",,"air pollution; airborne pollutant; computer model; corporate activity; emission; emission reduction; energy thrift campaign; environmental auditing; environmental instability; global warming; greenhouse gas; monitoring system; sustainable development; Carbon Dioxide--Control; Environmental Engineering--Computer Applications; Airborne Pollutants; Fossil Fuel Gases; Global Warming Effect; Greenhouse Effect; Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Modelling-Computer; Monitoring",,,,,,"Department of the Environment, This Common Inheritance (1989) White Paper on the Environment, , Department of the Environment, HMSO, London; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: the Scientific Assessment (1990) Working Group 1, , University Press, Cambridge, UK; Department of the Environment, (1990) Digest of Environmental Protection and Water Statistics, , Department of the Environment, UK, HMSO, London; Butler, John, Implications of the use of CFC alternatives on the building industry (1991) C.I.B.S.E.
