Box 3060, D-6500 Mainz, Germany","We discuss the role of the concentration increase of atmospheric CH4 (currently ≈ 0.8% yr-1) in climate change, including effects through chemical feedbacks, notably through formation of O3 and stratospheric H2O, and reduction of OH levels, which increases the lifetime of CH4. We present results of simulations with a coupled 1-D radiative-convective model, which includes chemical and radiative processes in the troposphere and stratosphere, and which treats both hemispheres separately. Our results deviate appreciably from those reported in earlier studies; the reason for this is discussed in detail. The current climate forcing by CH4 (excluding indirect chemical effects) is 26 times that of CO2 (calculated on a mole CO2 mole CH4 basis). A recently introduced quantity to express the time integrated effect of CH4 relative to that of CO2 over a given time interval is the global warming potential (GW P). We assess that the GW P of CH4, including chemical feedbacks, over a 10 year integration period is 26.9 ( mole CO2 mole CH4), decreasing to 7.5 for a time horizon of 100 years. Considering that the use of fossil fuels is associated with emissions of both CO2 and CH4, we evaluated the climatic consequences of switching from coal or oil to natural gas. We conclude that, if the fractional gas leakage from production and distribution of natural gas is below 4.3 - 5.7%, a switch from coal to natural gas as energy source would reduce the rate of climate warming. The use of gas would be preferable over the use of oil (from a climate point of view), if the fractional gas leakage is less than 2.4 - 2.9%. The ranges express uncertainties in CH4 releases from coal and oil production. © 1993.",,"carbon dioxide; coal; fossil fuel; hydrogen peroxide; methane; natural gas; oil; oxygen; water; atmosphere; climate; conference paper; experimental model; feedback system; hemisphere; simulation; stratosphere; time; troposphere; warming",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; methane, 74-82-8; natural gas, 8006-14-2; oxygen, 7782-44-7; water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Attmannspacher, Hartmannsgruber, Lang, Langzeittendenzen des Ozons der Atmosphäre aufgrund der 1967 begonnenen Ozonmeßreihen am Meteorologischen Observatorium Hohenpeißenberg (1984) Meteorol.
