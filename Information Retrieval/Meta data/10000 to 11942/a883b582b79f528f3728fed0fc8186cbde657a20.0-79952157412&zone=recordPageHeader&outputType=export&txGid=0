Indigenous peoples, including First Nations and Inuit communities around the world are more vulnerable to the risks associated with global warming. In this synthesis, examples of direct and indirect impacts and vulnerabilities on First Nations and Inuit people inhabiting Canada have been provided. Examples from other countries as a reminder that these populations are not alone have also been included. After visiting the topics of biophysical environment, cultural identity, cultural activities, food security and health with respect to First Nations and Inuit peoples conclusion on adaptation within the context of change has been given. The paper stresses also the importance of linking health to cultural identity and land use. To fully grasp the impact of climate change on First Nations and the Inuit, government stakeholders, policy makers, as well as researchers need to understand the connection that these people retain with their land. Reports from the Nunatsiaq News related to climate change to reiterate the concerns of Inuit people have been compiled. Graphs, stemming from the compilation, indicate what are perceived as the growing problems linked to climate changes in these communities. In order to take a positive, forward thinking, inclusive action, at the local level science will need to team up with traditional knowledge.","Climate change; Cultural activity; Food security; Malaysia Borneo",,,,,,,"McLean, G., (2009) Report of the Indigenous Peoples' Global Summit on Climate Change, , 20-24 April 2009, Anchorage, Alaska, 2009, (United Nations University -Traditional Initiative: Darwin, Australia); Green, D., Raygorodetsky, G., (2010) Indigenous knowledge of a changing climate, , Climate Change; Diaz, S., Biodiversity Loss Threatens Human Well-Being (2006) PLoS Biology, 4 (8), pp. 1300-1305; Ford, J.D., Dangerous climate change and the importance of adaptation for the Arctic's Inuit population (2009) Environ Res Lett, 4 (2); Schiermeier, Q., The new face of the Arctic (2007) Nature, 446 (7132), pp. 133-135; Ford, J.D., Vulnerability to climate change in Igloolik, Nunavut: What we can learn from the past and present (2006) Polar Record, 42 (2), pp. 127-138; Stocking, B., (2009) Climate Action, pp. 17-19; Berrang-Ford, L., Ford, J.D., Peterson, J., Are we adapting to climate change?
