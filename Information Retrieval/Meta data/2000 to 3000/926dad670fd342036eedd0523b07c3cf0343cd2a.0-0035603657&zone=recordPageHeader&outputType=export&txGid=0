From 1 to 3 million ha have burned on average during the past 80 years, with 6 years in the past two decades experiencing more than 4 million ha burned. A large-fire database that maps forest fires greater than 200 ha in area in Canada is being developed to catalogue historical fires. However, analyses using a regional climate model suggest that a changing climate caused by increasing greenhouse gases may alter fire weather, contributing to an increased area burned in the future. Direct carbon emissions from fire (combustion) are estimated to average 27 Tg carbon year-1 for 1959-1999 in Canada. Post-fire decomposition may be of a similar magnitude, and the regenerating forest has a different carbon sink strength. Measurements indicate that there is a net carbon release (source) by the forest immediately after the fire before vegetation is re-established. Daytime downward carbon fluxes over a burned forest take 1-3 decades to recover to those of a mature forest, but the annual carbon balance has not yet been measured. There is a potential positive feedback to global climate change, with anthropogenic greenhouse gases stimulating fire activity through weather changes, with fire releasing more carbon while the regenerating forest is a smaller carbon sink. However, changes in fuel type need to be considered in this scenario since fire spreads more slowly through younger deciduous forests. Proactive fuel management is evaluated as a potential mechanism to reduce area burned. However, it is difficult to envisage that such treatments could be employed successfully at the national scale, at least over the next few decades, because of the large scale of treatments required and ecological issues related to forest fragmentation and biodiversity.","Boreal forest; Carbon; Climate change; Forest fire; Fuel management",,,,,,,"Amiro, B.D., MacPherson, J.I., Desjardins, R.L., BOREAS flight measurements of forest-fire effects on carbon dioxide and energy fluxes (1999) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 96, pp. 199-208; Amiro, B.D., Paired-tower measurements of carbon and energy fluxes following disturbance in the boreal forest (2001) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 253-268; Amiro, B.D., Chen, J.M., Liu, J., Net primary productivity following forest fire for Canadian ecoregions (2000) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 30, pp. 939-947; Amiro, B.D., Todd, J.B., Wotton, B.M., Logan, K.A., Flannigan, M.D., Stocks, B.J., Mason, J.A., Hirsch, K.G., Direct carbon emissions from Canadian forest fires, 1959 to 1999 (2001) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 31, pp. 512-525; Auclai, A.N.D., Carter, T.B., Forest wildfires as a recent source of CO2 at northern latitudes (1993) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 23, pp. 1528-1536; Bergeron, Y., The influence of island and mainland lakeshore landscapes on boreal forest fire regimes (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 1980-1992; Caya, D., Laprise, R., Giguere, M., Bergeron, Y., Blanchet, J.P., Stocks, B.J., Boer, G.J., McFarlane, N.A., Description of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (1995) Boreal Forests and Global Change, pp. 477-482. , Eds MJ Apps, DT Price and J Wisniewski Kluwer Academic Publishers: Dordrecht; (1997) Compendium of Canadian Forestry Statistics, , Ottawa, Canada; Dixon, R.K., Krankina, O.N., Forest fires in Russia: Carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere (1993) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 23, pp. 700-705; (1993) Canada Vegetation Cover, , National Atlas of Canada, Ottawa; Flannigan, M.D., Wotton, B.M., Carcaillet, C., Richard, P., Campbell, I., Bergeron, Y., Fire weather: Past, present and future (1998) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Forest Fire Research and 14th Conference on Fire and Forest Meteorology, 16-20 November 1998, Luso, Portugal, pp. 113-128; Flannigan, M.D., Bergeron, Y., Engelmark, O., Wotton, B.M., Future wildfire in circumboreal forests in relation to global warming (1998) Journal of Vegetation Science, 9, pp. 469-476; (1992) Development and Structure of the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System, , Information Report ST-X-3.
