However, the urgency in understanding these global patterns has been accentuated by the threat of rapid climate change. We apply an adaptive model of environmental tolerance evolution to global climate data and climate change model projections to examine the relative impacts of climate change on different regions of the globe. Our results project more adverse impacts of warming on tropical populations due to environmental tolerance adaptation to conditions of low interannual variability in temperature. When applied to present variability and future forecasts of precipitation data, the tolerance adaptation model found large reductions in fitness predicted for populations in highlatitude northern hemisphere regions, although some tropical regions had comparable reductions in fitness. We formulated an evolutionary regional climate change index (ERCCI) to additionally incorporate the predicted changes in the interannual variability of temperature and precipitation. Based on this index, we suggest that the magnitude of climate change impacts could be much more heterogeneous across latitude than previously thought. Specifically, tropical regions are likely to be just as affected as temperate regions and, in some regions under some circumstances, possibly more so.","Biodiversity; Environmental tolerance; Global warming","article; biodiversity; climate change; environmental change; hemisphere; precipitation; priority journal; temperature; tropic climate; warming; Adaptation, Physiological; Biodiversity; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Evolution; Forecasting; Geography; Temperature",,,,,,"Dobzhansky, T., Evolution in the tropics (1950) Am Sci, 38, pp. 209-221; Janzen, D.J., Why mountain passer are higher in the tropics (1967) Am Nat, 101, pp. 203-249; Ghalambor, C.K., Huey, R.B., Martin, P.R., Tewksbury, J.J., Wang, G., Are mountain passes higher in the tropics?
