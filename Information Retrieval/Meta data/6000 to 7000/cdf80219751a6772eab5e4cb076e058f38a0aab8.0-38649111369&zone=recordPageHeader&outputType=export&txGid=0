Movement processes are especially important for amphibian management and conservation as species declines and extinctions worldwide become ever more apparent. To better integrate behavioral and ecological data on amphibian movements with our use of spatially explicit demographic models and guide effective conservation solutions, I present 1) a synopsis of the literature regarding behavior, ecology, and evolution of movement in pond-breeding amphibians possessing biphasic life cycles to distinguish between migration and dispersal processes, 2) a working hypothesis of juvenile-based dispersal, and 3) a discussion of conservation issues that follow from distinguishing the spatial and temporal movements of amphibians at different scales. I define amphibian migration as intrapopulational, round-trip movements toward and away from aquatic breeding sites. Population-level management, in general, can be focused on spatial scales of <1.0 km with attention focused on adult population and juveniles that remain near the natal wetland. I define amphibian dispersal as interpopulational, unidirectional movements from natal sites to other breeding sites. Metapopulation- or landscape-level management can be focused on movements among populations at spatial scales >1.0-10.0 km and on importance of terrestrial connectivity. The ultimate goal of conservation for amphibians should be long-term regional persistence by addressing management issues at both local and metapopulation scales.","Amphibian; Dispersal; Landscape; Metapopulation; Migration; Movement ecology","amphibian; connectivity; dispersal; metapopulation; migration; movement; pond; population decline; Amphibia; Animalia",,,,,,"Bartelt, P.E., Peterson, C.R., Klaver, R.E., Sexual differences in the post-breeding movements and habitats selected by western toads (Bufo boreas) in southeastern Idaho (2004) Herpetologica, 60, pp. 455-467; Beck, C.W., Congdon, J.D., Effects of age and size at metamorphosis on performance and metabolic rates of southern toad, Bufo terrestris, metamorphs (2000) Functional Ecology, 14, pp. 32-38; Berven, K.A., Grudzien, T.A., Dispersal in the wood frog (Rana sylvatica): Implications for genetic population structure (1990) Evolution, 44, pp. 2047-2056; Boone, M.D., Scott, D.E., Niewiarowski, P.N., Effects of hatching time for larval ambystomatid salamanders (2002) Copeia 2002, pp. 511-517; Breden, F., The effect of post-metamorphic dispersal on the population genetic structure of Fowler's toad, Bufo woodhousei fowleri (1987) Copeia 1987, pp. 386-395; Calhoun, A.J.K., Miller, N.A., Klemens, M.W., Conserving pool-breeding amphibians in human-dominated landscapes through local implementation of Best Development Practices (2005) Wetlands Ecology and Management, 13, pp. 291-304; Dingle, H., Ecology and evolution of migration (1980) Animal migration, orientation, and navigation, pp. 1-101. , S.
