Cave-flooding events are identified within the two samples by the presence of detrital layers composed of clay sized particles. Comparison with instrumental records of precipitation demonstrates a strong correlation between these cave-flood events and extreme rainfall observed in the Upper Mississippi Valley. A simple model is developed to assess the nature of rainfall capable of flooding the cave. The model is first calibrated to the last 50-yr (1950-1998 A.D.) instrumental record of daily precipitation data for the town of Spring Valley and verified with the first 50. yr of record from 1900 to 1949 A.D. Frequency analysis shows that these extreme flood events have increased from the last half of the nineteenth century. Comparison with other paleohydrological records shows increased occurrence of extreme rain events during periods of higher moisture availability. Our study implies that increased moisture availability in the Midwestern region, due to rise in temperature from global warming could lead to an increase in the occurrence of extreme rainfall events. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Cave flooding; Confocal microscopy; Extreme rainfall events; Fluorescent bands; Paleoclimate; Stalagmites","Extreme flood events; Extreme rainfall; Flood event; Fluorescent bands; Frequency Analysis; Hydrological response; Minnesota; Paleoclimates; Precipitation data; Rain events; Stalagmites; Strong correlation; Upper Mississippi; Confocal microscopy; Flood control; Floods; Fluorescence; Global warming; Moisture; Rain; Caves; cave; climate change; extreme event; global warming; hydrological response; microscopy; nineteenth century; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; stalagmite; Minnesota; United States",,,,,,"Baker, A., Smart, P.L., Edwards, R.L., Richards, D.A., Annual growth banding in a cave stalagmite (1993) Nature, 364, pp. 518-520; Baker, A., Genty, D., Smart, P.L., High-resolution records of soil humification and paleoclimate change from variations in speleothem luminescence excitation and emission wavelengths (1998) Geology, 26, pp. 903-906; Booth, R.K., Jackson, S.T., A high-resolution record of late-Holocene moisture variability from a Michigan raised bog, USA (2003) The Holocene, 13, pp. 863-876; Booth, R.K., Notaro, M., Jackson, S.T., Kutzbach, J.E., Widespread drought episodes in the western Great Lakes region during the past 2000years: geographic extents and potential mechanisms (2006) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 242, pp. 415-427; Cheng, H., Edwards, R.L., Hoff, J., Gallup, C.D., Richards, D.A., Asmerom, Y., The half-lives of uranium-234 and thorium-230 (2000) Chemical Geology, 169, pp. 17-33; Dasgupta, S., (2008) High-resolution speleothem record of late Quaternary climate change from the Upper Midwest, , University of Minnesota, USA; Dorale, J.A., Lepley, S.W., Edwards, R.L., (2005) The ultimate flood recorder: flood-deposited sediments preserved in stalagmites, , European Geosciences Union, Vienna, Austria; Edwards, R.L., Cheng, J.H., Wasserburg, G.J., 238U-234U-230Th-232Th systematics and the precise measurement of time over the past 500,000years (1987) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 81, pp. 175-192; Frappier, A.B., Sahagian, D., Carpenter, S.J., González, L.A., Frappier, B.R., Stalagmite stable isotope record of recent tropical cyclone events (2007) Geology, 35, pp. 111-114; Jaffey, A.H., Flynn, K.F., Glendenin, L.E., Bentley, W.C., Essling, A.M., Precision measurement of half-lives and specific activities of U-235 and U-238 (1971) Physical Reviews, 4, pp. 1889-1906; Karl, T.R., Knight, R.W., Plummer, N., Trends in high-frequency climate variability in the twentieth century (1995) Nature, 377, pp. 217-220; Kunkel, K.E., Andsager, K., Long-term trends in extreme precipitation events over the coterminous United States and Canada (1999) Journal of Climate, 12, pp. 2515-2527; Kutzbach, J.E., Williams, J.W., Vavrus, S.J., Simulated 21st century changes in regional water balance of the Great Lakes region and links to changes in global temperature and poleward moisture transport (2005) Geophysical Research Letters, 32, pp. L17707; Nyberg, J., Malmgren, B., Winter, A., Jury, M.R., Kilbourne, K.H., Quinn, T.M., Low Atlantic hurricane activity in the 1970s and 1980s compared to the past 270years (2007) Nature, 447, pp. 698-702; Polyak, V.J., Asmerom, Y., Late Holocene climate and cultural changes in the Southwestern United States (2001) Science, 294, pp. 148-151; Schumacher, R.S., Johnson, R.H., Characteristics of U.S. Extreme Rain Events during 1999-2003 (2006) Weather and Forecasting, 21, pp. 69-85; Shen, C.-C., Edwards, R.L., Cheng, H., Dorale, J.A., Thomas, R.B., Moran, S.B., Weinstein, S.E., Edmonds, H.N., Uranium and thorium isotopic and concentration measurements by magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (2002) Chemical Geology, 185, pp. 165-178; Shen, C.-C., Cheng, H., Edwards, R.L., Moran, S.B., Edmonds, H.N., Hoff, J.A., Thomas, R.B., Measurement of attogram quantities of 231Pa in dissolved and particulate fractions of seawater by isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectroscopy (2003) Analytical Chemistry, 75, pp. 1075-1079; Winkler, J.A., Climatological characteristics of summertime extreme rainstorms in Minnesota (1988) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 78, pp. 57-73; Yiou, P., Nogaj, M., Extreme climatic events and weather regimes over the North Atlantic: when and where?
