They affect climate by interfering with radiative transfer and the atmospheric temperature. Aerosol particulate matter has also been associated with various adverse health effects. Aerosol particles’ number and size distributions were measured inside and outside the houses in the urban areas of Évora and Lisbon in Portugal. The impact of the occurrence of a residential fire in the aerosols’ particle number is evaluated and discussed. Finally, we consider how the global increase in temperature can affect the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere via increased boundary layer convection. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","aerosol; air quality; climate change; global warming",,,,,,,"Bejan, A., Dincer, I., Lorente, S., Miguel, A.F., Reis, A.H., (2004) Porous and Complex Flow Structures in Modern Technology, , New York: Springer; Berghmans, P., Pauwels, J., Roekens, E., Monitoring heavy metals in the relation with coarse dust near open-stack deposits (1997) Journal of Aerosol Science, 28 (S1), pp. 301-302; Birmili, W., Heinke, K., Pitz, M., Matschullat, J., Wiedensohler, A., Cyrys, J., Wichmann, H.-E., Peters, A., Particle number size distributions in urban air before and after volatilisation (2009) Atmos.
