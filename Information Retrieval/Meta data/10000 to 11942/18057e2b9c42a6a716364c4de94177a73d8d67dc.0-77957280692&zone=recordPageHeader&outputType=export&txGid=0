Fog events are, however, more frequent, occurring on average 60-200 days per annum. Research has demonstrated that where there are frequent fog events trees have adapted to intercept and utilise the moisture from these events. In hyperarid environments such as at our study site trees are confined to the banks of ephemeral rivers. Here we determine the extent to which these trees are able to utilise both deep groundwater as well as fog water. The results of our model show that none of the trees in this study are able to utilise fog water even though fog events may contain considerable amounts of water. Rather, all of the trees are reliant on a seasonally fluctuating combination of groundwater, shallow soil water and deep soil water. These water sources directly depend on Kuiseb aquifer recharge resulting from flood water infiltration. If predictions for increased water abstraction and global climate change are realized and water levels of the aquifer decline substantially then the vegetation structure along ephemeral rivers such as the Kuiseb will be seriously threatened. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","δ18O/δ2 H isotopes; Ephemeral rivers; IsoSource; Namibia; Riparian trees; Water use","adaptation; aquifer; arid region; climate change; ephemeral stream; flood; fog; growth rate; growth response; hydrogen isotope; infiltration; interception; moisture; oxygen isotope; rainfall; recharge; riparian vegetation; seasonal variation; soil water; vegetation structure; water level; water use efficiency; Kuiseb River; Namibia",,,,,,"Bao, H., Thiemens, M.H., Heine, K., Oxygen-17 excesses of the Central Namib gypcretes: spatial distribution (2001) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 192, pp. 125-135; Busch, D.E., Ingraham, N.L., Smith, S.D., Water uptake in woody riparian phreatophytes of the South western United States: a stable isotope study (1992) Ecological Applications, 2 (4), pp. 450-459; Cavelier, J., Solis, D., Jaramillo, M.A., Fog interception in montane forests across the Central Cordillera of Panamá (1996) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 12, pp. 357-369; Cavelier, J., Goldstein, G., Mist and fog interception in elfin cloud forest in Colombia and Venezuela (1989) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 5, pp. 309-322; Clark, I.D., Fritz, P., (1997) Environmental Isotopes in Hydrogeology, p. 328. , Lewis, New York; Coleman, M.L., Shepherd, T.J., Durham, J.J., Rouse, J.E., Moore, G.R., Reduction of water with zinc for hydrogen isotope analysis (1982) Analytical Chemistry, 54, pp. 993-995; Craig, H., Isotopic variations in meteoric waters (1961) Science, 133, pp. 1702-1703; Dahan, O., (2007), Monitoring floodwater infiltration and recharge in ephemeral rivers.
