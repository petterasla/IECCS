Doubling the CO2 concentration increased daily net CO2 uptake by 49% throughout the 17 months and decreased daily transpiration by 24%, leading to a 110% increase in water-use efficiency. Under the doubled CO2 concentration, the activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) was 11% lower, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was 34% lower, and the activated:total ratio for Rubisco was 25% greater than under the current CO2 concentration. Less leaf epicuticular wax occurred on plants under the doubled CO2 concentration, which decreased the reflectance of photosynthetic photon flux (PPF); the chlorophyll content per unit leaf area was also less. The enhancement of daily net CO2 uptake by doubling the CO2 concentration increased when the PPF was decreased below 25 mol m-2 d-1, when water was withheld, and when day/night temperatures were below 17/12 °C. More leaves, each with a greater surface area, were produced per plant under the doubled CO2 concentration. The combination of increased total leaf surface area and increased daily net CO2 uptake led to an 88% stimulation of dry mass accumulation under the doubled CO2 concentration. A rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, together with accompanying changes in temperature, precipitation, and PPF, should increase growth and productivity of native populations of A, deserti.","Crassulacean acid metabolism; Gas exchange; Global climate change; Sonoran Desert","Agave deserti",,,,,,"Bowes, G., Growth at elevated CO2: Photosynthetic responses mediated through Rubisco (1991) Plant, Cell and Environment, 14, pp. 795-806; Bowes, G., Facing the inevitable: Plants and increasing atmospheric CO2 (1993) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology, 44, pp. 309-332; Campbell, W.J., Alien Jr., L.H., Bowes, G., Effects of CO2 concentration on Rubisco activity, amount, and photosynthesis in soybean leaves (1988) Plant Physiology, 88, pp. 1310-1316; Cao, H.X., Mitchell, J.F.B., Lavery, J.R., Simulated diurnal range and variability of surface temperature in a global climate model for present and doubled CO2 climates (1992) Journal of Climate, 5, pp. 920-943; Ceulemans, R., Mousseau, M., Taasley Review No. 71.
