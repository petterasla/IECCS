While most large-scale wind turbines are part of wind farms, which help states meet state renewable energy standards, several colleges and universities in the United States have purchased wind turbines for financial and educational purposes. This paper gives details of a cost-benefit analysis completed for a small liberal arts college in Illinois, Principia College, which is considering buying a single large-scale turbine. The process set forth here can easily be adapted to any college, university, or school. It is found that the project has a positive net present value for both a 20-year scenario and a 30-year scenario. Assuming the project did not receive any grants, Principia College would need to have an annual real return rate of about 6% on its initial investment to gain the same economic benefits. © 2010 by the authors.","Cost-benefit analysis; Education; Net-present value; Renewable energy; Wind power","Economic benefits; Energy security; Global climate changes; Illinois; Liberal arts; Net present value; Oil supplies; Present value; Renewable energies; Renewable energy; Renewable energy standards; Wind farm; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Investments; Wind power; Wind turbines; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,,"(2010) Database of Projects, , http://www.awea.org/projects, American Wind Energy, Association, Available online (accessed on 18 April; (2009) Annual Wind Industry Report, , American Wind Energy Association., Year Ending 2008; AWEA: Washington DC, USA; (2010) Global Wind Power Boom Continues Despite Economic Woes, , http://www.gwec.net, Global Wind Energy Council., Available online, accessed on 18 April; Söderholm, P., Klassen, G., Wind Power in Europe: A Simultaneous Innovation-Diffusion Model (2007) Environ.
