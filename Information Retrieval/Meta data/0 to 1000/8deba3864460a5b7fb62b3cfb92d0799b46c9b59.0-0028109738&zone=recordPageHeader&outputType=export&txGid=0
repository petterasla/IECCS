Although a large quantity of information exists about N2O emissions from various ecosystems, this study was initiated to demonstrate the features of N2O emissions from sea-based waste disposal sites in Osaka City in relation to CH4 emissions. Average N2O emissions at an active landfill (S-Site) were several times higher than those at a closed landfill (N-Site). Average CH4 emissions were also much greater at the S- Site. Regarding the nature of N2O emissions, remarkable emissions often were observed with aerobic waste layers at the N-Site, suggesting almost inversely related N2O emissions with CH4 production at the N-Site. However, at the S- Site a few exceptionally high N2O emissions were noted in cases of high CH4 emissions.",,"biogas; nitrous oxide; ozone; methane; nitrous oxide; article; denitrification; ecosystem; japan; landfill; methanogenesis; ozone layer; priority journal; sampling; siting; solid waste management; stratosphere; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; Japan; waste disposal; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Japan; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Refuse Disposal",,"nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; ozone, 10028-15-6; methane, 74-82-8; Air Pollutants; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,,"Tsujimoto, Y.; Environmental Engineering Division, Osaka City Institute of PHES, 8-34 Tojyocho, Tennouji-ku, Osaka City, Osaka 543, Japan",,,,,,,,10473289,,JIJME,15736347,"English","J.
