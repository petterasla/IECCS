Utilization of potential for energy savings is necessary for alleviating energy shortage, protecting environment and achieving sustainable economic and social development. This paper has not only comprehensively evaluated the China's energy savings opportunities, but also systematically analyzed the primary challenges and deficiencies in China's energy savings policies, and proposed targeted countermeasures and suggestions. This is of important guiding significance for China to establish a long-term effective mechanism to boost energy-saving technologies and products, and to promote the economic development toward a low-carbon mode. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Energy savings; Low carbon economy","China; Economic development; Economic growths; Effective mechanisms; Energy saving; Energy shortages; Energy-saving technologies; Financial crisis; Low carbon economy; Low-carbon; Social development; Sustainable economics; Economic and social effects; Economics; Global warming; Sustainable development; Energy conservation; carbon emission; economic analysis; energy conservation; energy efficiency; environmental economics; financial crisis; global warming; policy making; sustainable development; China",,,,,,"China's energy consumption in 2009, , http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjdt/zygg/sjxdtzgg/t20100812_402664717.htm, National Bureau of Statistics of China, Available at, [accessed 12.08.10]; Ma, H., Les, O., John, G., China's energy situation in the new millennium (2009) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 13, pp. 1781-1799; Low carbon economy helps tackle financial crisis, climate change, , http://en.in-en.com/article/News/Global/html/2009032410905.html, International Energy Net, Available at, [accessed 24.03.09]; Jiang, B., Sun, Z., Liu, M., China's energy development strategy under the low carbon economy (2010) Energy, 35, pp. 4257-4264; Philip, A., China's ongoing energy efficiency drive: origins, progress and prospects (2009) Energy Policy, 37, pp. 1331-1344; 46 "" Energy-saving Law"" supporting national standards are successively implemented since 1 June, , http://www.china5e.com/show.php?contentid=21223, China Energy Netcom Research Center, Available at, [accessed 10.06.08]; Authorized to announce: suggestion of formulating 12th five-year plan for economic and social development, , http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2010-10/27/c_12708501.htm, Xinhua News Agency, Available at[accessed 27.10.10]; China's energy production capacity has enhanced greatly and energy structure is being optimized continually, , http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjfx/ztfx/qzxzgcl60zn/t20090922_402589088.htm, National Bureau of Statistics of China, Available at[accessed 22.09.09]; China to cut more outdated capacity, , http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/video/2010-04/07/c_13241322.htm, Xinhua News Agency, Available at, [accessed 07.04.10]; (2009) Catalogue of national key energy-saving technologies to promote( [2008]No.36 and [2009] No.24), , National Development and Reform Commission, Beijing; Notice of examination results on energy-saving objectives of 1000 enterprises, , http://www.sdpc.gov.cn/hjbh/hjjsjyxsh/t20091124_315031.htm, National Development and Reform Commission, Available at, [accessed 16.10.09]; (2004) The policy for automobile industry development ([2004] No.8), , National Development and Reform Commission, Beijing; State, C., (2009) The automobile industry restructuring and revitalization plan (2009-2011), , Beijing; Zhou, N., Mark, D., Levine, Lynn P.
