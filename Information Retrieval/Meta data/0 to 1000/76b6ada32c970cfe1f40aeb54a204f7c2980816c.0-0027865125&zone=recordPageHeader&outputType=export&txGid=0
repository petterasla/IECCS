Approximately 15 000-25 000 forest fires occured annually during this period. Mean annual direct CO2-C emissions from wildfire was approximately 0.05 Pg over this 21-year period. Total post-fire biogenic CO2-C emissions for 1971-1991 ranged from 2.5 to 5.9 Pg (0.12-0.28 Pg annually). Future forest fire scenarios in Russia based on general circulation model projections suggest that up to 30-50% of the land surface area, or 334 × 106 to 631 × 106 ha of forest, will be affected. An additional 6.7 × 106 to 12.6 × 106 ha of Russian boreal forest are projected to burn annually if general circulation model based vegetation-change scenarios are achieved within the next 50 years. -from Authors",,"biomass burning; carbon dioxide; emission; fire; forest fire; Russian Federation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027865125
