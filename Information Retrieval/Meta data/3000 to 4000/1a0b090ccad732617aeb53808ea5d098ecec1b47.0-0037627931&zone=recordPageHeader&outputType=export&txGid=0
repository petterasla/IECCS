Examining the mean latitude of individuals of each species, 3 species showed significant or near-significant northward shifts, and 1 a significant shift southward. Over all 5 species examined, colonization events were concentrated in the northern part of the distributions of the species; in 3 species, extinctions were concentrated in the southern part of the distributions of the species. The conclusion is that significant distributional changes have taken place, but they have been subtle, and might be associated with global climate change.",,"Aves",,,,,,"Allen, C.D., Breshears, D.D., Drought-induced shift of a forest-woodland ecotone: Rapid landscape response to climate variation (1998) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 95, pp. 14839-14842; Holt, R.D., The microevolutionary consequences of climate change (1990) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 5, pp. 311-317; Houghton, J.T., Meira Filho, L.G., Callander, B.A., Harris, N., Kattenberg, A., Maskell, K., (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Hulme, M., Barrow, E.M., Arnell, N.W., Harrison, P.A., Johns, T.C., Downing, T.E., Relative impacts of human-induced climate change and natural climate variability (1999) Nature, 397, pp. 688-691; Karl, T.R., Knight, R.W., Easterling, D.R., Quayle, R.G., Indices of climate change for the United States (1996) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 77, pp. 279-292; Parmesan, C., Climate and species' range (1996) Nature, 382, pp. 765-766; Visser, M.E., Van Noordwijk, A.J., Tinbergen, J.M., Lessels, C.M., Warmer springs lead to mistimed reproduction in great tits (Parus major) (1998) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 265, pp. 1867-1870","Peterson, A.T.; Natural History Museum, Biodiversity Research Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, United States; email: town@ku.edu",,,,,,,,00384909,,SWNAA,,"English","Southwest.
