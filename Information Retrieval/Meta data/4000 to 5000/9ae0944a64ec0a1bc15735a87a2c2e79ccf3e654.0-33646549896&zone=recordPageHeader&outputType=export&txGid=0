We studied the effect of poultry manure, cattle slurry, sewage sludge, NH4NO3 or urea on C cycling and sequestration in silage grass production. Soil respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured with chambers, and soil samples were analysed for total C and dissolved organic C (DOC). Treatments were applied over 2 years and measurements were carried out over 3 years to assess possible residual effects. Organic fertilizer applications increased CO2 loss through soil respiration but also enhanced soil C storage compared with mineral fertilizer. Cumulative soil respiration rates were highest in poultry manure treatments with 13.7 t C ha-1 in 2003, corresponding to 1.6 times the control value, but no residual effect was seen. Soil respiration showed an exponential increase with temperature, and a bimodal relationship with soil moisture. The greatest NEE was observed on urea treatments (with a CO2 uptake of -4.4 g CO 2 m-2 h-1). Total C and DOC were significantly greater in manure treatments in the soil surface (0-10 cm). Of the C added in the manures, 27% of that in the sewage pellets, 32% of that in the cattle slurry and 39% of that in the poultry manure remained in the 0-10 cm soil layer at the end of the experiment. Mineral fertilizer treatments had only small C sequestration rates, although uncertainties were high. Expressed as global warming potentials, the benefits of increased C sequestration on poultry manure and sewage pellet treatments were outweighed by the additional losses of N 2O, particularly in the wet year 2002. Methane was emitted only for 2-3 days on cattle slurry treatments, but the magnitudes of fluxes were negligible compared with C losses by soil respiration. © 2006 British Society of Soil Science.","C sequestration; CO2 flux; Grassland; Manure; N-fertilization; Soil respiration","carbon sequestration; dissolved organic carbon; global warming; manure; methane; sewage disposal; soil management; soil respiration; Bos taurus",,,,,,"Adams J, M., Faure, H., Faure-Denard, L., McGlade, J.M., Woodward, F.I., Increases in terrestrial carbon storage from the last glacial maximum to the present (1990) Nature, 348, pp. 711-714; Allard, V., Soussana, J.F., Ambus, P., Amman, C., Campbell, C., Clifton-Brown, J., Czobel, S., Tuba, Z., Assessing the greenhouse gas balance of the GreenGrass network of sites (2005) GREENGRASS Final Report, pp. 60-68. , In. ed J.-F.*Soussana pp. INRA Clermont Ferrand France (January 2005); Azam F, Simmons, F.W., Mulvaney, R.L., Mineralisation of N from plant residues and its interaction with native soil N (1993) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 25, pp. 1787-1792; Ball B, C., McTaggart, I.P., Scott, A., Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from soil under silage production by use of organic or slow release fertilizer (2004) Soil Use and Management, 20, pp. 287-295; Bittman S, T., Forge, A., Kowalenko, C.G., Responses of the bacterial and fungal biomass in a grassland soil to multi-year applications of dairy manure slurry and fertilizer (2005) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 37, pp. 613-623; Clayton H, Arah, J.R.M., Smith, K.A., Measurement of nitrous oxide emissions from fertilized grassland using closed chambers (1994) Journal of Geophysical Research, 99, pp. 16599-16607; Clayton H, McTaggart, I.P., Parker, J., Swan, L., Smith, K.A., Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilized grassland: A 2-year study of the effects of N fertilizer form and environmental conditions (1997) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 25, pp. 252-260; Conant R, T., Paustian, K., Elliott, E., Grassland management and conversion into grassland: Effects on soil carbon (2001) Ecological Applications, 11, pp. 343-355; Davidson E, A., Belk, E., Boon, R.D., Soil water content and temperature as independent or confounded factors controlling soil respiration in a temperate mixed hardwood forest (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 217-227; Dobbie K, E., McTaggart, I.P., Smith, K.A., Nitrous oxide emissions from intensive agricultural systems: Variations between crops and seasons, key driving variables, and mean emission factors (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmosphere, 104, pp. 26891-26899; Doran J, W., Mielke, L.N., Stamatiadis, S., Microbial activity and N cycling as regulated by soil water-filled pore space (1988) Tillage and Traffic in Crop Production - Proceedings International Soil Tillage Research Organisation, 11th, Edinburgh, Scotland.
