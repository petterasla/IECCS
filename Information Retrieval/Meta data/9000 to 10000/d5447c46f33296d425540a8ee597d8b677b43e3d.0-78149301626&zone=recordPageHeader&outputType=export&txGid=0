Cuttings were subjected to three temperature regimes (control, +2°C and +4°C, respectively) in closed-top chambers. Compared with the control treatment, warming significantly increased the net photosynthesis rate, height growth, leaf dry mass, stem dry mass (SM), root dry mass (RM) and total dry mass (TM), and resulted in a higher aboveground:belowground dry mass ratio (AB) in all individuals of both sexes, except in males under the +2°C warming treatment. Furthermore, warming decreased the concentration of C in the stems in both sexes, and increased the concentration of N in the leaves of females, and consequently, resulted in a lower C:N ratio in the leaves of female cuttings than in those of male cuttings. Also, further differences between males and females were detected. In the warming treatments, females exhibited significantly higher values of SM, RM, TM and AB, and lower RM:TM and RM:foliage area ratios than did the males. However, no significant differences in these traits between the two sexes were detected under ambient temperature. Our results indicated that allocation of biomass, and the concentrations of C and N in males and females are greatly affected by an elevated temperature, and that warming benefits females, which accumulate and allocate more biomass to aboveground organs than do the males. © 2010 CSIRO.",,"bioaccumulation; biomass allocation; carbon; dicotyledon; global warming; growth rate; nitrogen; photosynthesis; phytomass; Populus cathayana",,,,,,"Agren, J., Sexual differences in biomass and nutrient allocation in the dioecious Rubus chamaemorus (1988) Ecology, 69, pp. 962-973. , doi:10.2307/1941251; Allen, G.A., Antos, J.A., Relative reproductive effort in males and females of the dioecious shrub Oemleria cerasiformis (1988) Oecologia, 76, pp. 111-118; An, Y., Wan, S., Zhou, X., Subedar, A.A., Wallace, L.L., Luo, Y., Plant nitrogen concentration, use efficiency, and contents in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem under experimental warming (2005) Global Change Biology, 11 (10), pp. 1733-1744. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01030.x; Callaway, R.M., Delucia, E.H., Thomas, E.M., Schlesinger, W.H., Compensatory responses of CO2 exchange and biomass allocation and their effects on the relative growth rate of ponderosa pine in different CO2 and temperature regimes (1994) Oecologia, 98, pp. 159-166. , doi:10.1007/BF00341468; Chen, D.X., Coughenour, M.B., Eberts, D., Thullen, J.S., Interactive effects of CO2 enrichment and temperature on the growth of dioecious Hydrilla verticillata (1994) Environmental and Experimental Botany, 34, pp. 345-353. , doi:10.1016/0098-8472 94 90016-7; Darwin, C., (1877) The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species, , John Murray: London; Davidson, R.L., Effect of root/leaf temperature differentials on root/shoot ratios in some pasture grasses and clover (1969) Annals of Botany, 33, pp. 561-569; Dawson, T.E., Bliss, L.C., Patterns of water use and the tissue water relations in the dioecious shrub, Salix arctica: The physiological basis for habitat partitioning between the sexes (1989) Oecologia, 79, pp. 332-343. , doi:10.1007/BF00384312; Dawson, T.E., Ehleringer, J.R., Gender-specific physiology, carbon isotope discrimination, and habitat distribution in boxelder, Acer negundo (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 798-815. , doi:10.2307/1940807; Delph, L.F., Sex-differential resource allocation patterns in the subdioecious shrub Hebe subalpina (1990) Ecology, 71, pp. 1342-1351. , doi:10.2307/1938271; Delucia, E.H., Heckathorn, S.A., Day, T.A., Effects of soil temperature on growth, biomass allocation and resource acquisition of Andropogon gerardii Vitman (1992) New Phytologist, 120, pp. 543-549. , doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb01804.x; Domisch, T., Finér, L., Lehto, T., Effects of soil temperature on biomass and carbohydrate allocation in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings at the beginning of the growing season (2001) Tree Physiology, 21, pp. 465-472; Freeman, D.C., Klikoff, L.G., Harper, K.T., Differental resource utilization by sexes of dioecious plants (1976) Science, 193, pp. 597-599. , doi:10.1126/science.193.4253.597; Gedroc, J.J., McConnaghay, K.D.M., Coleman, J.S., Plasticity in root/shoot partitioning: Optimal, ontogenetic, or both?
