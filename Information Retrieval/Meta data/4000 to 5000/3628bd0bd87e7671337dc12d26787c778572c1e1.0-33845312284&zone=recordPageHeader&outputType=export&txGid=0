For the past 15 years the University of East Anglia has been addressing these concerns through a multi-pronged approach using technical means of low-energy building design, installing renewable energy sources, good energy management and raising awareness. Through good energy management, the university has been able to reduce the energy consumption of already low-energy buildings by as much as 50%. A large-scale building-integrated photovoltaic (PV) array has been installed along with on-site generation of heating, cooling and electricity via a 3 MW combined heat and power (CHP) plant and, recently, an adsorption chiller. In this paper, potential improvements in a more effective utilisation of PV electricity will also be discussed, as will future plans to reduce carbon emissions by installing further sources of renewable energy. The last part of this paper focuses on the CRed (Community Carbon Reduction) Programme established in 2003 and based at the university. The CRed programme takes up this challenge through innovative and integrated ways in promoting a low carbon economy and, in particular, promoting awareness.","Conservartion; Management; Recycling of materials","Carbon; Climate change; Energy management; Energy utilization; Regional planning; Renewable energy resources; Adsorption chiller; Carbon economy; Combined heat and power (CHP) plant; Recycling of materials; Environmental engineering; architectural design; carbon; electricity generation; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy planning; global warming; photovoltaic system; recycling; renewable resource; university sector; East Anglia; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,"Boardman, B., Darby, S., Killip, G., Hinells, M., Jardine, C., Palmer, J., Sinden, G., (2005) 40% House, , Environmental Change Institute, Oxford University, Oxford; Tovey, N.K., Nunn, R., (2004) The Design of Low Carbon Environmental Systems for Use in the Conversion of a City Centre Office Block into Residential Flats at Duke Street, Norwich, , www2.env.uea.ac.uk/cred/duke_street/duke_street.htmforfurtherdetails, Energy Savings Trust Report; New Low Energy Multi-residential Accommodation, , www.est.org.uk/housingbuildings/publications/forfurtherdetails, BRECSU.
