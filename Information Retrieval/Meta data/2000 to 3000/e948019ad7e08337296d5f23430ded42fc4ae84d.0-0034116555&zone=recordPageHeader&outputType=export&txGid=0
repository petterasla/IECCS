Research Center, PO Box 28, Edgewater, MD 21037, United States","Tolerance of desiccation was examined in three species of moss, Grimmia antarctici Card., Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid. and Bryum pseudotriquetrum (Hedw.) Gaertn., Meyer et Scherb. collected from two sites of contrasting water availability in the Windmill Islands, continental Antarctica. Physiological tolerance to desiccation was measured using chlorophyll fluorescence in plugs of moss during natural drying in the laboratory. Differences in relative water content, rate of drying and the response of photosynthesis to desiccation were observed among the three species and between sites. Of the three species studied, G. antarctici showed the lowest capacity to sustain photosynthetic processes during desiccation, B. pseudotriquetrum had an intermediate response and showed the greatest plasticity and C. purpureus showed the greatest capacity to sustain photosynthesis during desiccation. These results fit well with the known distribution of the three species with G. antarctici being limited to relatively wet sites, C. purpureus being common in the driest sites and B. pseudotriquetrum showing a wide distribution between these two extremes. Levels of soluble carbohydrates were also measured in these samples following desiccation and these indicate the presence of stachyose, an oligosaccharide known to be important in desiccation tolerance in seeds, in B. pseudotriquetrum. Both gross morphology and carbohydrate content are likely to contribute to differences in desiccation tolerance of the moss species. These results indicate that if the Casey region continues to dry out, as a result of local geological uplifting or global climate change, we would expect to see not only reductions in the moss community but also changes in community composition. G. antarctici is likely to become more limited in distribution as C. purpureus and B. pseudotriquetrum expand into drying areas.","Bryum pseudotriquetrum; Ceratodon purpureus; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Grimmia antarctici; Soluble carbohydrates; Stachyose","desiccation; moss; tolerance; water stress; Antarctica; Bryum pseudotriquetrum; Ceratodon purpureus; Grimmia antarctici",,,,,,"Albini, F.M., Murelli, M., Finza, P.V., Ferrarotti, M., Cantoni, B., Puliga, S., Vazzana, C., Galactinol in the leaves of the resurrection plant Boea hygroscopica (1999) Phytochemistry, 51, pp. 499-505; Alpert, P., Oechel, W.C., Carbon balance limits the distribution of Grimmia laevigata, a desiccation-tolerant plant (1985) Ecology, 66, pp. 660-669; Alpert, P., Oechel, W.C., Comparative patterns of net photosynthesis in an assemblage of mosses with contrasting microdistributions (1987) American Journal of Botany, 74, pp. 1787-1796; Bachmann, M., Matile, P., Keller, F., Metabolism of the raffinose family oligosaccharides in leaves of Ajuga reptans L (1994) Plant Physiology, 105, pp. 1335-1345; Bayfield, N.G., Notes on water relations of Polytrichum commune Hedw (1973) Journal of Bryology, 7, pp. 607-617; Björkman, O., Demmig, B., Photon yield of O2 evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics at 77K among vascular plants of diverse origins (1987) Planta, 170, pp. 489-504; Castonguay, Y., Nadeau, P., Enzymatic control of soluble carbohydrate accumulation in cold-acclimated crowns of alfalfa (1998) Crop Science, 38, pp. 1183-1189; Chapman, B.E., Roser, D.J., Seppelt, R.D., 13C NMR analysis of Antarctic cryptogram extracts (1994) Antarctic Science, 6, pp. 295-305; Crowe, J.H., Crowe, L.M., Stabilization of membranes in anhydrobiotic organisms (1986) Membranes, Metabolism and Dry Organisms, pp. 188-230. , (Ed.
