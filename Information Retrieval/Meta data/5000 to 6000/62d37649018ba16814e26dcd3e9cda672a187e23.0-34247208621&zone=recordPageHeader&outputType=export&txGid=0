There is a near universal consensus that global warming is human-caused and that its effects are now accelerating. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption is now well-documented. The global connections between social disruption, resource use and environmental degradation are now all too familiar. This information is all the more disturbing in view of the well-documented collapse of scores of past civilizations whose cultural patterns of behaviour have been described as 'self-organized' extinction. Policies to deal with the issues of sustainability have been hampered by a one-dimensional economic theory that has until recently dominated pubic discourse. Using the concept of 'generalized Darwinism', this paper focuses on the contributions a revitalized science of economics can bring to the sustainability debate. It ends with a cautiously pessimistic assessment of the prospects for sustainability.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Co-evolution; Collapse; Generalized Darwinism; Walrasian economics; Well-being; World systems analysis","biodiversity; climate change; coevolution; economic theory; self organization; sustainability; world system",,,,,,"Bahn, P., Flenley, J., (1992) Easter Island, Earth Island, , London and New York: Thames and Hudson;; Blanchflower, D., Oswald, D., (2000) Well-being over time in Britain and the U.S.A, , NBER Working Paper 7481.
