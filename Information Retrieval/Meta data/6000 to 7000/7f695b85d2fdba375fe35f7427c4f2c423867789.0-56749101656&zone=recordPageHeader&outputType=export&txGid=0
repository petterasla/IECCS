Discrepancies among the recent global SOC estimates by different researchers underscore the importance of precise estimation of the uncertainty associated with the SOC stocks. A method was recently proposed to estimate the SOC storage uncertainty using the Taylor series of approximations. Here we show that the accuracy of SOC storage uncertainty can be improved by incorporating the covariance among the input variables. Measurement of input variables from independent samples or use of an incomplete model leads to either over-or underestimation of the SOC storage uncertainty. The application of the method to an experimenral data set indicated that ignoring covariance would lead to a substantial overestimate of the uncertainty. © Soil Science Society of America All rights reserved.",,"Chelation; Climate change; Climatology; Fire hazards; Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Programmable logic controllers; Soils; C sequestrations; Data sets; First orders; Global climate changes; Incomplete models; Input variables; SOC storages; Soil organic C; Soil organic carbon storages; Taylor-Series; Uncertainty analysis; carbon sequestration; climate change; estimation method; global climate; land use change; soil carbon; soil organic matter; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,"Akala, V.A., Lal, R., Soil organic carbon pools and sequestration rates in reclaimed minesoils in Ohio (2001) J.
