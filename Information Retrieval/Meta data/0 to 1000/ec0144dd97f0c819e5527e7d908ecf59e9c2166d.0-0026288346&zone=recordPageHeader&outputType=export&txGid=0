Net flux, estimated by deducting amounts taken up by boreal forest soils could be about 10% lower. Wetlands are by far the largest source (2.2 Tg.yr-1, 73% of total) followed in decreasing order by landfills (0.34 Tg.yr-1, 11%), coastal areas and freshwater bodies (0.31 Tg.yr-1, 10%) animal and manure (0.14 Tg.yr-1, 5%) and combustion processes and leakage of natural gas (0.03 Tg.yr-1, 1%). Man-made wetland disturbances associated with drainage have reduced methane emissions by about 0.29 Tg.yr-1. -from Authors",,"methane; sink; source; wetland; Sweden; Animalia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026288346
