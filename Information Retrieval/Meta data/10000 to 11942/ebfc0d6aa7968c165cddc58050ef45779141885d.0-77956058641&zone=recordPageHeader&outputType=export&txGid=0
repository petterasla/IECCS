This method includes the procedure of the optimal linear smoothing (POLS) for the finding of optimal trends, independent "" reading"" of relative fluctuations in terms of β-distribution function that are formed after subtraction of the calculated trend and the recognition of the proper fitting hypothesis for the integrated optimal trends by the eigen-coordinates method. The combined noninvasive approach was applied to analysis of temperature data obtained from the site http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ related to the global warming (GW) phenomenon. These data are considered as nontrivial examples of verification of new forecasting method. The available data were combined into six files covering the mean/anomalous temperature 1546month's points covering the period from the January of 1880 up to October of 2008. Besides the global registered points the combined files included in themselves the north/south data points measured independently for both the Earth's hemispheres. The combined new method (preliminary verified on mimic data) applied to these files predicts the changing of the GW period by the global cooling (GC) period that will happen during the years 2038-2136. Besides this important result a new method helps to discover the influence of a small but stable oscillating process with a set of self-similar periods Ω n=Ω 0ξ n, n=0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4 with mean period 〈T〉=12.55year. This fact should present interest for ecologists and meteorologists working in this field. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Eigen-coordinates method; Global warming phenomenon; Procedure of the optimal linear smoothing (POLS)","Basic principles; Data points; Eigen-coordinates method; Forecasting methods; Global cooling; Linear smoothing; Mean period; Prediction methods; Self-similar; Temperature data; Distribution functions; Global warming; Optimization",,,,,,"Anderson, T.W., (1971) The statistical analysis of time series, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Brillinger, D.R., (1975) Time series data analysis and theory, , Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc; Shumway, R.H., Stoffer, D.S., (2006) Time series analysis and its applications with examples, , Springer; Elsner, J.B., Tsonis, A.A., Singular spectrum analysis (1996) A new tool in time series analysis, , Springer; Hamilton, J.D., (1994) Time series analysis, , Princeton University Press; Brockwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., (1991) Time series: theory and methods, , Springer; Chatfield, C., (2000) Time-series forecasting, , Chapman & Hall/CRC; Malinetsky, G.G., Kurdumov, S.P., Izvestia of Russian Academy of Science (2001) Nonlinear dynamics and forecasting problems, 71, p. 210. , [in Russian]; Malinetsky, G.G., Potapov, A.B., Channels and jakers neural view of complex dynamics (1998) IZV, VUZ, PND, 6, p. 18; Malinetsky, G.G., Limitation of delay reconstruction for chaotic systems (1993) Phys Rev E, 48, p. 904; Zhou, W.-X., Sornette, D., Yuan, W.-K., Multifractality of inverse statistics of exit distances in 3D fully developed turbulence (2006) Physica D, 214, p. 55; Zhou, W.-X., Sornette, D., Hill, R.A., Dunbar, R.I.M., Discrete hierarchical organization of social group sizes (2005) Proc R Soc London, 272, p. 439; Nigmatullin, R.R., The statistics of the fractional moments: is there any chance to read "" quantitatively"" any randomness?
