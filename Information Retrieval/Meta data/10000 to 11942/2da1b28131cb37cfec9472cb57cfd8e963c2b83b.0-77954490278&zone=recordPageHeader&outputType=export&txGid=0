Despite the complexity of the context, in our view the main objectives of the ruminants physiologist should be convergent for both industrialized (IC) and developing countries (DC) in a common and global strategy of advancing knowledge. In DC, this means improving the efficiency of RPS, taking into account the unique possibility of using rangelands. For IC settings, RPS should be revisited in terms of autonomy and environment- friendly feeding and managing practices. Assuming that competition for feed/food use is still a crucial criterion, future ruminant feeding systems (FeSyst) should preferably focus on lignocellulosic sources. According to biome distributions, and the recent increases in volumes of crop residues and their by-products, the annually renewed volumes of these biomasses are considerable. Therefore, we need to redesign our strategies for their efficient utilization at the local level. For this purpose, digestion processes and rumen functioning need to be better understood. The renewed vision of ruminal digestion through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is also a key aspect as it is an environmental demand that cannot be ignored. With regard to other ruminants physiological functions, accumulated knowledge could be mobilized into an integrative approach that puts forward the adaptive capacities of animals to face variability in quantity and quality of supplied feeds. Basically, the reduction of inputs that were traditionally used to ensure FeSyst will need more flexible animals. In that sense, the concepts of homeostasis and teleophorhesis need to be updated and adapted to domestic species and breeds that were until now largely excluded from the dominant productive systems. In conclusion, a more holistic approach of research targets is required in which physiological functions and farmers practices must converge and respond to each particular situation in an integral, dynamic and flexible conceptual perspective. From a scientific point of view, both for ICs and DCs, a broader range of experimental scenarios should be explored in order to arrive at innovative practices and solutions that respect environmental, ethical and economical issues. The clear challenge is to in evaluate the sustainability of RPSs. This includes, in our opinion, a strong interaction with other disciplines (multi- and trans-disciplinary conception), thus structuring new relevant indicators for the evaluation sustainability. © 2010 The Animal Consortium.","adaptive capacity; environment; feeding; ruminant; sustainability","Animalia; Bovidae",,,,,,"Agabriel, J., Petit, M., Recommandations alimentaires pour les vaches allaitantes (1987) Bulletin Technique CRZV Theix INRA, 70, pp. 153-166; Akin, D.E., Rigsby, L.L., Sethuraman, A., Morrison, W.H., Gamble, G.R., Eriksson, K.E., Alterations in structure, chemistry, and biodegradability of grass lignocellulose treated with the white rot fungi Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Cyathus stercoreus (1995) Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 61, pp. 1591-1598; (1980) The Nutrient Requirements of Ruminant Livestock, p. 351. , ARC Agricultural Research Council, CAB, Slough, UK; Archimède, H., Boval, M., Alexandre, G., Xandé, A., Aumont, G., Poncet, C., Effect of regrowth age on intake and digestion of Digitaria decumbens consumed by Blackbelly sheep (2000) Animal Feed Science and Technology, 87, pp. 153-162; Atti, N., Bocquier, F., Adaptation des brebis Barbarine à l'alternance sous-nutrition-ré alimentation: Effets sur les tissus adipeux (1999) Annales de Zootechnie, 48, pp. 189-198; Atti, N., Bocquier, F., Khaldi, G., Performance of the fat-tailed barbarine sheep in its environment: Adaptive capacity to alternation of underfeeding and re-feeding periods.
