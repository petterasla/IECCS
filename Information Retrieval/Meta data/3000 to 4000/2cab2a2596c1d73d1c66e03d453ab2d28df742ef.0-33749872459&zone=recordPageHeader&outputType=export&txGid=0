The ice core was analyzed continuously for stable isotopes (δ18O), cations (Na+, K+, Mg 2+, Ca2+) and anions (Cl-, SO4 2-, NO3 -) throughout the core. Cycles indicated by δ18O, cations and anions were identified and counted as seasonal fluctuations as annual increment from maximum to maximum values. Reconstructed 300-year annual net accumulation from the core reveals a major precipitation trend for the central Himalayas with an average precipitation 750 mm per year. The trend, separated from the time series, shows a strong correlation to global temperature. Generally, as northern global temperature increases 0.1 °C, the accumulation decreases about 80mm and vise versa. This may suggests that monsoon precipitation in Himalayas have decreased continuously in past decade as a response to global warming.","Global warming; Himalayas; Monsoon precipitation",,,,,,,"Webster, P.J., Magana, V.O., Palmer, T.N., Monsoon: Processes, predictability, and the prospects for prediction (1998) J.
