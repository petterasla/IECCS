Carbon dioxide (CO2) is non-toxic, non-flammable, has zero ozone depletion potential and negligible global warming potential as refrigerant. Referring to a transcritical CO2 cycle working as a classical ""split-system"" to cool air in residential applications, the aim of this paper is the evaluation of the energy performances using an internal heat exchanger. The experimental plant employs a semi-hermetic compressor, plate-finned tube type heat exchangers, a back pressure valve electronically controlled and an expansion valve. Besides it is possible to control the flash gas produced in the liquid receiver thanks to another semi-hermetic compressor linked to an inverter. An increase of the coefficient of performance has been found using the internal heat exchanger. The comparison of the coefficients of performance of two cycles, working with and without the internal heat exchanger, is discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.","Carbon dioxide; Compression system; Experiment; Heat exchanger; Improvement; Liquid-vapour; Performance; Refrigeration system; Transcritical cycle","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Ozone; Ozone layer; Experimental evaluations; Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC); Ozone-depletion potential (ODP); Transcritical; Vapour compression; Working fluids; Greenhouse effect",,,,,,"(1994) ASHRAE Handbook.
