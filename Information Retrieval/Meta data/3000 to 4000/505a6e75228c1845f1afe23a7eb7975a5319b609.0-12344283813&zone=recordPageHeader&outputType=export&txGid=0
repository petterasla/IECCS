Biodegradable polymers offer the potential of addressing a wide range of environmental concerns associated with conventional polymers such as greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability. LCA is a tool specifically developed for assessing the overall environmental burden of a product including the system used for manufacturing it and its end-of-life treatment. This paper provides a cradle-to-grave LCA of two polymers that may be used in food packaging applications: polylactide (PLA), which is a biodegradable polymer derived from corn; and polypropylene (PP), which is primarily derived from natural gas in the United States. An inventory analysis of the PLA and PP systems is presented. An impact assessment focused on global warming is also provided. Although measured field or facility data are preferred for a rigorous LCA, PEP data can provide a reasonable basis when measured data are unavailable. Energy inventories and greenhouse gas emissions are readily derived from PEP data, but other potentially relevant impact indicators are not. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Inventory analysis; Polylactide; Polypropylene","Greenhouse gas emissions; Inventory analysis; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Polylactide(PLA); Biodegradation; Data acquisition; Greenhouse effect; Natural gas; Packaging; Particulate emissions; Polymers; Polypropylenes; Life cycle; Zea mays",,,,,,"Barnthouse, L., Fava, J., Humphreys, K., Hunt, R., Laibson, L., Noesen, S., Norris, G., Young, J., (1997) Lifecycle Impact Assessment: the State-of-the-art, Report of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Life-Cycle Assessment Impact Assessment Workgroup, , SETAC LCA Advisory Group, Pensacola, FL: SETAC Press; (2003) Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 2001 Facts and Figures, , EPA530-R-03-011, Washington, DC: U.S. EPA; (2001) 2000 Distribution of Plastic Resin Sales and Captive Use by Major Market - All Resins, , Arlington, VA: American Plastics Council; Boustead, I., (1999) Eco-profiles of Plastics and Related Intermediates Methodology, , Brussels, Belgium: The European Centre for Plastics in the Environment (PWMI) of the Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe (APME); Bohlmann, G., Biodegradable polymer life cycle assessment (2001) Process Economics Program (PEP) Report No. 115D, 115 D. , Menlo Park, CA: SRI Consulting; Vink, E., Rabago, K., Glassner, D., Gruber, P., Applications of life cycle assessment to NatureWorks™ polylactide (PLA) production (2003) Polymer Degradation and Stability, 80, pp. 403-419; Lee, E., Freed, R., Driscoll, W., Stafford, S., (1998) Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Management of Selected Materials in Municipal Solid Waste, , EPA530-R-98-013, Washington, DC: U.S. EPA; Vigon, B., Tolle, D.A., Cornaby, B.W., Latham, H.C., Harrison, C.L., Boguski, T.L., Hunt, R.G., Sellers, J.D., (1993) Life-cycle Assessment: Inventory Guidelines and Principles, , PB93139681; Lunt, J., Large-scale production, properties and commercial applications of polylactic acid polymers (1998) Polymer Degradation and Stability, 59, pp. 145-152","Bohlmann, G.M.; SRI Consulting, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States; email: gbohlmann@sriconsulting.com",,,,,,,,02784491,,ENVPD,,"English","Environ.
