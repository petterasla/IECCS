This paper considers the current and future role of economic instruments as policy instruments for use by governments. In many developed countries, past over-regulation allied to a serious shortfall of experienced environmental enforcers required regulatory regimes to be supplemented by well targeted economic instruments and green taxes. Their application to countries which do not have developed environmental control systems is more questionable. The purported threats of the longer term effects of global warming, damage to the ozone layer and an apparent loss of biodiversity have led environmentalists to adopt the so-called precautionary principle. Sustainable development has added to the pressures for further national and transfrontier legislation. The challenge facing policymakers, therefore, is to design policies to enable market forces to operate in the environmental sphere, for example through a system of pollution charges, principally intended to promote greater environmental efficiency. These charging systems can be of many kinds but their main defining feature is their reliance on markets and the price mechanism to internalise environmental externalities, thereby attempting to make polluters pay through facing the full social costs of their activities. Some of the applications of these charging systems, financial and fiscal instruments and tradable emission systems are explained and illustrated.In 1999, some countries are developing and effectively applying economic instruments for environmental protection and natural resource management, whilst others are relying on command and control regulatory procedures under-enforced by sometimes inadequately trained and motivated enforcement officers.

Some of the applications of these charging systems, financial and fiscal instruments and tradable emission systems are explained and illustrated.Economic instruments as policy instruments are seen generally as an evolution in policy making from the conventional reliance on laws and regulations that polluters must adopt under penalty of fines or other sanctions. These economic instruments allow polluters with relatively low abatement costs to treat their wastes, while allowing those with relatively high abatement costs to buy permits, thereby avoiding abatement costs. The use of economic instruments requires the existence of a strong institutional framework whereby the economic signals created can travel efficiently. Illustrations are provided of some economic instruments that have been adopted by members of the OECD. These include: charge systems, subsidies and investments, pollution taxes, market creation, bonds and deposit refund systems, liability systems, and property rights. The principal environmental areas for the application of economic instruments are elucidated.","Economic instruments complementary to command and control regimes, green taxes","Economic instruments; Environmental control system; Green taxes; Precautionary principle; Tradable emission system; Environmental impact; Global warming; Laws and legislation; Ozone layer; Public policy; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Water pollution; Environmental protection; economic instrument; environmental protection; policy making; precautionary principle; sustainable development; article; ecology; economic aspect; environmental planning; law enforcement; policy; pollution control; resource management; tax",,,,,,"Beckerman, W., (1995) Small is Stupid; Burnett, S., (1997) Economic Incentives to Achieve Environmental Control, , March, IMPAX Capital Corporation Limited Address to Conference on 'Insuring Pollution Risk', London; (1998) EC White Paper on Strict Liability for Environmental Damage, , October; Goldsmith, E., (1998) The Great U-Turn, De-Industrialising Society, , Green Books, Devon; Hawkins, R.G.P., (1998) Some 1998 Potential Environmental Concerns for the Insured in UK Industry, , March, (Address to the United Kingdom Environmental Law Association Annual Conference at the University of Sussex); (1996) HM Customs and Excise Landfill Tax Regulations, p. 527. , Statutory Instrument No; (1998) Sustainable Waste Management, Sixth Report, , 17 June; Kenny, A., (1994) The Earth is Fine, the Problem is the Greens, , 12 March, (Spectator Magazine); Markandya, Pearce, D.W., Barbier, E.B., (1989) Blueprint for a Green Economy, , London Earthscan; Porritt, J., (1990) Friends of the Earth Handbook, p. 22; (1994) Transport and the Environment, 18th Report; Smith, S., (1995) Green Taxes and Charges: Policy and Practice in Britain and Germany, p. 67. , Institute for Fiscal Studies; (1997), The Economist, December(1999), The Economist, 9 January(1990) This Common Inheritance, Command Paper, 2068, p. 35; (1996), UNEP Annual Report(1990) Global Consultation on Safe Water and Sanitation for the 1990s, , a Background Paper for the 1990 New Delhi Conference of the same name","Hawkins, R.United Kingdom; email: richardhawkins.edenhall@btinternet.com",,,,,,,,00496979,,WAPLA,,"English","Water Air Soil Pollut.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034302256
