They are important because of their potential contributions as a future source of energy, to global warming, and as a possible trigger for long run-out submarine slope instability. This paper describes laboratory experiments to synthesise disseminated methane hydrates and to characterise them under small-strain dynamic loading in the resonant column apparatus. The effects of depositing varying quantities of methane hydrate within a sand are investigated by reference to their shear and bulk modulus, and damping, over a range of isotropic effective stress. Results are compared with those obtained on the same sand without hydrate bonding and after dissociation.","Dynamics; Laboratory tests; Offshore engineering","Damping; Dissociation; Elastic moduli; Methane; Sand; Stiffness; Laboratory tests; Offshore engineering; Gas hydrates; gas hydrate; geotechnical property; sand",,,,,,"Ashmawy, A.K., Drnevich, V.P., A general dynamic model for the resonant column/quasi-static torsional shear apparatus (1994) Geotech.
