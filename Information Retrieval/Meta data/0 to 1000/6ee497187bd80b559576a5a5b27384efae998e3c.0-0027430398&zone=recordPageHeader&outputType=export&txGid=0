But changes in vegetation and soil type that result in a net release of CO2 to the atmosphere (such as those caused by wildfires) could be more rapid than changes that result in a net increase in terrestrial carbon storage (such as species immigration and soil formation), so that in its transient response to climate change, the terrestrial vegetation/soil system could be a net source of carbon to the atmosphere. Here we use two general circulation models3,4 to estimate the transient response of the terrestrial surface to a step doubling of atmospheric CO2. We find that vegetation and soil changes could prove to be a significant source of CO2 in the first 50-100 years following a climate warming, increasing the atmospheric CO2 concentration ty up to a third of the present level.",,"carbon storage; GCM; transient response; warming",,,,,,,"Smith, T.M.; Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, United States",,,,,,,,00280836,,NATUA,,"English","Nature",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027430398
