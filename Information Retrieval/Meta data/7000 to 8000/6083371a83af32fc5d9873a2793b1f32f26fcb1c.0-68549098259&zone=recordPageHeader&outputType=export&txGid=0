Recently, taphonomic representation of biota in the lithosphere has been widely used for minimizing the biases in palaeo-environmental reconstructions including global climate change. In September 2001, a sediment trap was installed at the central area of the Loch Coire Fionnaraich (LCFR), a small, oligotrophic mountain loch in northwest Scotland for a taphonomic study of cladoceran zooplankton. The trap was emptied on a seasonal basis, where an average 0.14 g dry material was recovered in each season, January, May and August 2002 respectively. A sediment core was also taken from near the sediment trap location. The top 0.5 cm section, the 'core' was used for a comparative study with the trap sediment samples. The planktonic Cladocera consisted of Bosmina coregoni and appeared to have excellent preservation in the trap assemblages. Moreover, some common littoral Cladocera such as Alonella excisa and Alona guttata appear to be less well preserved in the fossil assemblages. Large littoral taxa such as Eurycercus lamellatus and Alona quadrangularis were rare in the trap but relatively common and well preserved in the sediment-water interface. It is suggested that taphonomic processes play a dominant role on deposition of fossil remains of Cladocera and caution should be taken while inferring the past environmental changes whilst using fossil assemblages recovered from the lake centre as a representation of the entire cladoceran community in the lake. © Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.","Cladocera; Core-top; Loch Coire Fionnaraich; Mountain lakes; Representativity; Scotland; Sediment trap; Taphonomy",,,,,,,"Barker, P., Gasse, F., Roberts, N., Taieb, M., Taphonomy and diagenesis in diatom assemblages; a Late Pleistocene palaeoecological study from Lake Magadi, Kenya (1990) Hydrobiologia, 214, pp. 267-272; Battarbee, R.W., Mackay, A.W., Jewson, D.H., Ryves, D.B., Sturm, M., Differential dissolution of Lake Baikal diatoms: Correction factors and implications for palaeoclimatic reconstructions (2005) Global Planetary Change, 46, pp. 75-86. , DOI:10.1016/j.gloplacha.2004.11.007; Behrensmeyer, A.K., Kidwell, S.M., Taphonomy's contributions to paleobiology (1985) Paleobiology, 11, pp. 105-119; Behrensmeyer, A.K., Kidwell, S.M., Gastaldo, R.A., Taphonomy and Paleobiology (2000) Paleobiology, 26, pp. 103-147; Bredesen, E.L., Bos, D.G., Laird, K.R., Cumming, B.F., A cladoceran-based paleolimnological assessment of the impact of forest harvesting on four lakes from the central interior of British Columbia, Canada (2002) Journal of Paleolimnology, 28, pp. 389-402. , DOI:10.1023/A:1021887915458; Brooks, S.J., Birks, H.J.B., Chironomid-inferred air temperatures from Lateglacial and Holocene sites in northwest Europe: Progress and problems (2001) Quaternary Science Reviews, 20, pp. 1723-1741; Cameron, N.G., The representation of diatom communities by fossil assemblages in a small acid lake (1995) Journal of Paleolimnology, 14, pp. 185-223; Chu, G., Liu, J., Schettler, G., Sun, Q., Gu, Z., Lu, H., Liu, Q., Liu, T., Sediment fluxes and varve formation in Sihalongwan, a Maar lake from northeastern China (2005) Journal of Paleolimnology, 34, pp. 311-324; Davidson, T.A., Sayer, C.D., Perrow, M.R., Tomlinson, M.L., Representation of fish communities by scale subfossils in shallow lakes: Implications for inferring percidcyprinid shifts (2003) Journal of Paleolimnology, 30, pp. 441-449; Davidson, T.A., Sayer, C.D., Perrow, M.R., Bramm, M., Jeppesen, E., Are the controls of species composition similar for contemporary and subfossil cladoceran assemblages?
