Many of the worldwide amphibian declines have been caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and two contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain these declines. Positive correlations between global warming and Bd-related declines sparked the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis, which proposes that global warming increased cloud cover in warm years that drove the convergence of daytime and nighttime temperatures toward the thermal optimum for Bd growth. In contrast, the spatiotemporal-spread hypothesis states that Bd-related declines are caused by the introduction and spread of Bd, independent of climate change. We provide a rigorous test of these hypotheses by evaluating (i) whether cloud cover, temperature convergence, and predicted temperature-dependent Bd growth are significant positive predictors of amphibian extinctions in the genus Atelopus and (ii) whether spatial structure in the timing of these extinctions can be detected without making assumptions about the location, timing, or number of Bd emergences. We show that there is spatial structure to the timing of Atelopus spp. extinctions but that the cause of this structure remains equivocal, emphasizing the need for further molecular characterization of Bd. We also show that the reported positive multi-decade correlation between Atelopus spp. extinctions and mean tropical air temperature in the previous year is indeed robust, but the evidence that it is causal is weak because numerous other variables, including regional banana and beer production, were better predictors of these extinctions. Finally, almost all of our findings were opposite to the predictions of the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis. Although climate change is likely to play an important role in worldwide amphibian declines, more convincing evidence is needed of a causal link. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Chytridiomycosis; Climate change; Emerging infectious disease; Extinction; Global warming","air temperature; Amphibia; article; Atelopus; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycetes; climate change; fungus growth; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; priority journal; species extinction; toad; Animal Diseases; Animals; Anura; Chytridiomycota; Climate; Demography; Extinction, Biological; Population Dynamics; Amphibia; Atelopus; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Fungi; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Glavin, T., (2007) The Sixth Extinction: Journeys Among the Lost and Left Behind, , Thomas Dunne Books, New York; Avise, J.C., Hubbell, S.P., Ayala, F.J., In the light of evolution II: Biodiversity and extinction (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 11453-11457; Wake, D.B., Vredenburg, V.T., Are we in the midst of the sixth mass extinction?
