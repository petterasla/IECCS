In 2004, The Consortium for Research on Renewable Industrial Materials (CORRIM) evaluated the life-cycle environmental impacts of building materials used in residential construction. This report builds upon those findings by examining the environmental burdens of each component used to construct wall and floor subassemblies in residential homes. Evaluating components and subassemblies illuminates how the environmental burdens from different products, designs, and processes compare. Summary performance measures were developed for fossil fuel energy requirements, global warming potential, air and water pollution, and solid waste. This study clearly shows that the use of wood-based building materials significantly reduces most environmental burdens. The study also demonstrates the benefits of biofuels, recycling, and pre-cutting to reduce solid waste. This study's significance is enhanced by the detailed insights it provides on how architects and product and process engineers can substantially reduce environmental burdens. © Forest Products Society 2006.",,"Biofuels; Residential construction; Residential homes; Air pollution; Building materials; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Recycling; Water pollution; Environmental impact; Air Pollution; Fossil Fuels; Recycling; Solid Wastes; Water Pollution; Wood Products",,,,,,,"Lippke, B.; Rural Technology InitiativeUnited States; email: blippke@u.washington.edu",,,,,,,,00157473,,FPJOA,,"English","For Prod J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750799100
