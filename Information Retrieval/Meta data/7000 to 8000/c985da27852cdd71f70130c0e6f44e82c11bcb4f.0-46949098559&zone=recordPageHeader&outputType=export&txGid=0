Estimates of the contribution of ice algae to total primary production range widely, from just 3 to &gt;50%, and the importance of ice algae to higher trophic levels remains unknown. To help answer this question, we investigated a novel approach to food web studies by combining the two established methods of stable isotope analysis and fatty acid (FA) analysis-we determined the C isotopic composition of individual diatom FA and traced these biomarkers in consumers. Samples were collected near Barrow, Alaska and included ice algae, pelagic phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans. Ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton had distinctive overall FA signatures and clear differences in δ 13C for two specific diatom FA biomarkers: 16:4n-1 (-24.0 ± 2.4 and -30.7 ± 0.8‰, respectively) and 20:5n-3 (-18.3 ± 2.0 and -26.9 ± 0.7‰, respectively). Nearly all δ 13C values of these two FA in consumers fell between the two stable isotopic end members. A mass balance equation indicated that FA material derived from ice algae, compared to pelagic diatoms, averaged 71% (44-107%) in consumers based on δ 13C values of 16:4n-1, but only 24% (0-61%) based on 20:5n-3. Our estimates derived from 16:4n-1, which is produced only by diatoms, probably best represented the contribution of ice algae relative to pelagic diatoms. However, many types of algae produce 20:5n-3, so the lower value derived from it likely represented a more realistic estimate of the proportion of ice algae material relative to all other types of phytoplankton. These preliminary results demonstrate the potential value of compound-specific isotope analysis of marine lipids to trace C flow through marine food webs and provide a foundation for future work. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Compound specific; Diatoms; Lipid; Pelagic phytoplankton; Trophic linkages","biological marker; carbon; fatty acid; alga; biomarker; diatom; fatty acid; food web; global warming; isotopic analysis; lipid; marine ecosystem; phytoplankton; primary production; sea ice; stable isotope; trophic level; animal; Arctic; article; chemistry; diatom; food chain; ice cover; population dynamics; United States; Alaska; Animals; Arctic Regions; Biological Markers; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Diatoms; Fatty Acids; Food Chain; Ice Cover; Population Dynamics; Alaska; Barrow; North America; United States; algae; Bacillariophyta; Cetacea; Pinnipedia",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Biological Markers; Carbon Isotopes; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Fatty Acids",,,,"Albers, C.S., Kattner, G., Hagen, W., The composition of wax esters, triacylglycerols and phospholipids in Arctic and Antarctic copepods: Evidence of energetic adaptations (1996) Mar Chem, 55, pp. 347-358; Auel, H., Harjes, M., De Rocha, R., Stübing, D., Hagen, W., Lipid biomarkers indicate different ecological niches and trophic relationships of the Arctic hyperiid amphipods Themisto abyssorum and T. libellula (2002) Polar Biol, 25, pp. 374-383; Booth, B.C., Horner, R.A., Microalgae on the Arctic Ocean Section, 1994: Species abundance and biomass (1997) Deep Sea Res II, 44, pp. 1607-1622; Bradstreet, M.S.W., Thick-billed murres and black guillemots in the Barrow Strait area, N•W.T., during spring: Diets and food availability along ice edges (1980) Can J Zool, 58, pp. 2120-2140; Bradstreet, M.S.W., Cross, W.E., Trophic relationships at high Arctic ice edges (1982) Arctic, 35, pp. 1-12; Budge, S.M., Parrish, C.C., Lipid class and fatty acid composition of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries and Pseudo-nitzschia pungens and effects of lipolytic enzyme deactivation (1999) Phytochemistry, 52, pp. 561-566; Budge, S.M., Iverson, S.J., Koopman, H.N., Studying trophic ecology in marine ecosystems using fatty acids: A primer on analysis and interpretation (2006) Mar Mam Sci, 22, pp. 759-801; Budge, S.M., Springer, A.M., Iverson, S.J., Sheffield, G., Fatty acid biomarkers reveal niche separation in an arctic benthic food web (2007) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 336, pp. 305-309; Clarke, K.R., Green, R.H., Statistical design and analysis for a 'biological effects' study (1988) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 46, pp. 213-226; Conte, M.H., Volkman, J.K., Eglinton, G., Green, J.C., Leadbeater, B.S.C., Lipid biomarkers of the Haptophyta (1994) The Haptophyte Algae.
