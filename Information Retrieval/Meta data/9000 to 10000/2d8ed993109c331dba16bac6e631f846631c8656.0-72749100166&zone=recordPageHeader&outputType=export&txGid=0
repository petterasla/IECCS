For example, the record-breaking 2003 summer heat wave in Europe has given a glimpse of possible future European climate conditions. Here we use an ensemble of regional climate simulations for the end of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries over Europe to show that frequency, length and intensity changes in warm and cold temperature extremes can be derived to a close approximation from the knowledge of changes in three central statistics, the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the Probability Distribution Function, for which current climate models are better suited. In particular, the effect of the skewness parameter appears to be crucial, especially in the case of cold extremes, since it mostly explains the relative warming of these events compared to the whole distribution. An application of this finding is that the future impacts of extreme heat waves and cold spells on non-climatological variables (e.g., mortality) can be estimated to a first-order approximation from observed time series of daily temperature transformed in order to account for simulated changes in these three statistics. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.",,"Climate condition; Close approximation; Cold temperatures; Daily temperatures; First-order approximations; Heat waves; Human society; Intensity change; Possible futures; Regional climate simulation; Standard deviation; Summer heat; Temperature extremes; Climatology; Computer simulation; Distribution functions; Global warming; Probability density function; Time series; Climate models",,,,,,"Alexander, L.V., Arblaster, J.M., Assessing trends in observed and modelled climate extremes over Australia in relation to future projections (2009) Int J Climatol, 29, pp. 417-435; Ballester, J., Douville, H., Chauvin, F., Present-day climatology and projected changes of warm and cold days in the CNRM-CM3 global climate model (2009) Clim Dyn, 32, pp. 35-54; Ballester, J., Rodó, R., Giorgi, F., Future changes in Central Europe heat waves expected to mostly follow summer mean warming (2009) Clim Dyn, , doi:10.1007/s00382-009-0641-5; Christensen, J.H., Carter, T.R., Rummukainen, M., Amanatidis, G., Evaluating the performance and utility of regional climate models: The PRUDENCE project (2007) Clim Change, 81, pp. 1-6; Giorgi, F., Climate change hot-spots (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, p. 08707. , doi:10.1029/2006GL025734; Giorgi, F., Mearns, L.O., Introduction to special section: Regional climate modelling revisited (1999) J Geophys Res, 104, pp. 6549-6562; Haines, A., Kovats, R.S., Campbell-lendrum, D., Corvalan, C., Climate change and human health: Impacts, vulnerability, and mitigation (2006) Lancet, 9528, pp. 2101-2109; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Mathieu, P.P., Sutton, R.T., Dong, B., Collins, M., Predictability of winter climate over the North Atlantic European Region during ENSO events (2004) J Clim, 17, pp. 1953-1974; McMichael, A.J., Woodruff, R.E., Hales, S., Climate change and human health: Present and future risks (2006) Lancet, 9513, pp. 859-869; Meehl, G.A., Tebaldi, C., More intense, more frequent, and longer lasting heat waves in the 21st century (2004) Science, 13, pp. 994-997; Parmesan, C., Yohe, G., A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 37-42; Rodó, X., Pascual, M., Fuchs, G., Faruque, A.S.G., ENSO and cholera: A nonstationary link related to climate change?
