To assess the direct impact of extremely hot weather on human health, we investigated heat-related deaths in Japan from 1968 through 1994, analyzing the data to determine the distribution of the deaths by age and their correlation to the incidence of hot days in summer. Vital Statistics of Japan, published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, was the source of the heat-related mortality data employed in this study. Meteorological data were obtained from the District Meteorological Observatories in Tokyo and Osaka, the two largest cities in Japan. Heat-related deaths were most prone to occur on days with a peak daily temperature above 38°C, and the incidence of these deaths snowed an exponential dependence on the number of hot days. Thus, even a small rise in atmospheric temperature may lead to a considerable increase in heat-related mortality, indicating the importance of combating global warming. Furthermore, half (50.1%) of the above-noted deaths occurred in children (4 years and under) and the elderly (70 years and over) irrespective of gender, indicating the vulnerability of these specific age groups to heat. Since a warmer climate is predicted in the future, the incidence of heat waves will increase, and more comprehensive measures, both medical and social, should be adopted for children of 4 years and younger the elderly to prevent heat-related deaths in these age groups.","Heat waves; Heat-related deaths; Hot environment; Japan","adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; child; female; greenhouse effect; heat; heat stroke; human; infant; Japan; male; meteorological phenomena; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Heat; Heat Stroke; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Meteorological Factors; Middle Aged",,,,,,"Applegate, W.B., Runyan J.W., Jr., Brasfield, L., Williams, M.L., Konigsberg, C., Fouche, C., Analysis of the 1980 heat wave in Memphis (1981) J am Geriatr Soc, 29, pp. 337-342; Kalkstein, L.S., Smoyer, K.E., The impact of climate change on human health: Some international implications (1993) Experientia, 49, pp. 969-979; Knochel, J.P., Environmental heat illness (1974) Arch Intern Med, 133, pp. 841-864; Levine, J.A., Heat stroke in the aged (1969) Am J Med, 47, pp. 251-258; Loevinsohn, M.E., Climatic warming and increased malaria incidence in Rwanda (1994) Lancet, 343, pp. 714-718; Lye, M., Kamal, A., Effects of a heatwave on mortality-rates in elderly inpatients (1977) Lancet, 1, pp. 529-531; Mitchell, J., Manabe, S., Meleshko, V., Tokioka, T., Equilibrium climate change - And its implications for the future (1990) Climate Change: the IPCC Scientific Assessment, pp. 131-172. , Houghton JT, Jenkins GJ, Ephraums JJ (eds) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Morimoto, T., Nakai, S., Death incidences from heat stroke and meteorological conditions in Japan (1996) Environment and Biometeorology, p. 703. , QianPing (ed) China Agricultural Scientific Press, Beijing; Monthly report of the Japan Meteorological Agency (January 1968 edn, to December 1994 edn) (1968) The Japan Meteorological Agency, , Tokyo; Schuman, S.H., Patterns of urban heat-wave deaths and implications for prevention: Data from New York and St. Louis during July, 1966 (1972) Environ Res, 5, pp. 59-75; Schuman, S.H., Anderson, C.P., Oliver, J.T., Epidemiology of successive heat waves in Michigan in 1962 and 1963 (1964) JAMA, 189, pp. 733-738; Smoyer, K.E., A comparative analysis of heat waves and associated mortality in St. Louis, Missouri - 1980 and 1995 (1998) Int J Biometeorol, 42, pp. 44-50; Vital statistics of Japan (1968 edn to 1994 edn) (1968) The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, , Tokyo; (1990) Potential Health Effects of Climatic Change, , World Health Organization, Geneva; Zhang, J., Mao, Z., Clinical and epidemiological studies on 271 cases of severe heat-stroke in the elderly (1990) Jpn J Biometeorol, 27, pp. 77-82","Itoh, T.; Department of Physiology, Kyoto Pref.
