Currently, the waste oils after use in cooking are not disposed adequately. Such oils could serve as a feedstock for biodiesel which would also address the waste disposal issue. This study compares the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) and conventional diesel used in transport. The functional unit (FU) is 100 km transportation by light duty diesel vehicle (LDDV) under identical driving conditions. Life cycle GHG emissions from conventional diesel are about 32.57 kg CO2-eq/FU whereas those from UCOME are 2.35 kg CO2-eq/FU. The GHG emissions from the life cycle of UCOME are 93% less than those of conventional diesel production and use. Hence, a fuel switch from conventional diesel to UCOME will contribute greatly to a reduction in global warming potential. This will also support the Thai Government's policy to promote the use of indigenous and renewable sources for transportation fuels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
