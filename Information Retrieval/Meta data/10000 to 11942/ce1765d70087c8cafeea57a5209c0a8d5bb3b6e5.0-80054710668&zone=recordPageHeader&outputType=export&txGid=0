China has the second-largest area of rice cultivation in the world, accounting for ca. 19% of the world's rice-producing area. Recognizing the significance of China's rice cultivation in the global CH 4 budget, we estimated the CH 4 emissions resulting from irrigated rice cultivation in China from 1960 to 2050 using a CH4MOD model. The model estimates suggest that the annual CH 4 emissions decreased from 5.62 Tg yr -1 in 1960 to 4.13 Tg yr -1 in 1970, and this decrease was attributed to changes in water management from continuous flooding to mid-season drainage irrigation. Since the early 1970s, the amount of CH 4 emissions gradually increased to 6.85 Tg yr -1 by 2009 because of significant improvements in crop production that led to high-crop residue retention. Higher levels of CH 4 emissions occurred in southern China, where double rice cropping systems are most common. For the A1B and B1 scenarios of the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), the amount of CH 4 emissions from 2010 to 2050 is predicted to increase at an average rate of 1.2 kg ha -1 yr -1 in response to global warming. Compared to 2009, the CH 4 flux is predicted to increase by ca. 14% by the late 2040s, and the increase in these emissions in northeastern China is estimated to become more significant than in the other rice-growing regions of the country. Under the assumptions that the rice-producing land area will remain the same, decrease by 25% or increase by 38% by the late 2040s, the CH 4 emissions are projected to be 7.8, 5.6 or 11.7 Tg yr -1, respectively. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","China; Global warming; Methane emissions; Model estimates; Rice cultivation","crop production; cropping practice; cultivation; drainage; emission; global warming; methane; modeling; paddy field; rice; water management; China",,,,,,"Aselman, I., Crutzen, P.J., Global distribution of natural freshwater wetland and rice paddies, their net primary production, seasonality and possible methane emissions (1989) Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry, 8, pp. 307-358; Aulakh, M.S., Wassmann, R., Rennenberg, H., Methane transport capacity of twenty-two rice cultivars from five major Asian rice-growing countries (2002) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 91, pp. 59-71; Bachelet, D., Kern, J., Tolg, M., Balancing the rice carbon budget in China using spatially-distributed data (1995) Ecological Modelling, 79, pp. 167-177; Bertacchi, U.C., Olsson, J., Morita, O., Statistical atmospheric downscaling for rainfall estimation in Kyushu Island, Japan (2001) Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 5, pp. 259-271; Bloom, A., Palmer, P., Fraser, A., Reay, D., Frankenberg, C., Large-Scale Controls of Methanogenesis Inferred from Methane and Gravity Spaceborne Data (2010) Science, 327, pp. 322-325; Cai, Z., Xing, G., Yan, X., Xu, H., Tsurura, H., Yagi, K., Minami, K., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy fields as affected by nitrogen fertilizers and water management (1997) Plant and Soil, 196, pp. 7-14; Cai, Z., Tsuruta, H., Gao, M., Xu, H., Wei, C., Options for mitigating methane emission from a permanently flooded rice field (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 37-45; Clarke, L., Edmonds, J., Jacoby, H., Pitcher, H., Reilly, J., Richels, R., (2007) Scenarios of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Atmospheric Concentrations, Sub-report 2.1A of Synthesis and Assessment Product 2.1 by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research, , Department of Energy, Office of Biological & Environmental Research, Washington, DC, USA; Crutzen, P.J., Lelieveld, J., Human impacts on atmospheric chemistry (2001) Annual Reviews of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 29, pp. 17-45; Deneir van der Gon, H.A.C., Changes in CH4 emission from rice fields from 1960s to 1990 1 (2000) Impacts of modern rice technology, Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 14, pp. 61-72; Denier van der Gon, H.A.C., Changes in CH4 emission from rice fields from 1960 to 1990s 2.
