We examined the relationship between large-scale climate indices (CIs), regional climate factors (RFs), and rates of change in regional catches (RCs) of chum and pink salmon in five regions of the North Pacific. Correlation coefficients of RCs with RFs were larger than those of RCs with CIs, although the correlation coefficient of particular variables varied among regions. Climate affected salmon stocks as indicated by significant relationships with various terrestrial and ocean climate factors on a regional scale. These results suggest that no single CI or RF controls salmon abundance in all regions; however, global climate changes could affect regional climate directly and regional salmon abundance indirectly. A warming trend in the North Pacific might affect the long-term change in salmon abundance. The mechanisms controlling regional salmon abundance must be understood better to forecast successfully future conditions for Pacific salmon stocks, because the response of salmon stocks to global climate change varies among regions. © 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","chum salmon; climate change; large-scale climate indices; pink salmon; regional process; regional stock dynamics","abundance; climate change; correlation; decadal variation; long-term change; regional climate; salmonid fishery; stock assessment; timescale; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Oncorhynchus keta",,,,,,"Beamish, R.J., Bouillon, D.R., Pacific salmon production trends in relation to climate (1993) Canadian Journal of Fisheries & Aquatic Sciences, 50 (5), pp. 1002-1016; Beamish, R.J., Mahnken, C., A critical size and period hypothesis to explain natural regulation of salmon abundance and the linkage to climate and climate change (2001) Progress in Oceanography, 49 (1-4), pp. 423-437. , DOI 10.1016/S0079-6611(01)00034-9, PII S0079661101000349; Beamish, R.J., Neville, C.E., Cass, A.J., Production of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in relation to decadal-scale changes in the climate and the ocean (1997) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 54, pp. 543-554; Beamish, R.J., Neville, C.-E.M., Thomson, B.L., Harrison, P.J., St. John, M., A relationship between Fraser River discharge and interannual production of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) in the Strait of Georgia (1994) Canadian Journal of Fisheries & Aquatic Sciences, 51 (12), pp. 2843-2855; Blackbourn, D.J., Comparison of release size and environmental data with the marine survival rates of some wild and enhanced stocks of pink and chum salmon in British Columbia and Washington State (1990) 14th Northeast Pacific Pink and Chum Salmon Workshop, pp. 82-87. , Ed. by P.
