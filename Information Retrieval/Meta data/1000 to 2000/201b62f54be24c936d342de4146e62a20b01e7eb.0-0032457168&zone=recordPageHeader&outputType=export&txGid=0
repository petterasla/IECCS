Root elongation as a function of soil temperature was determined for the CAM succulent Opuntia ficus-indica, under three different day/night air temperatures (15 °C/5 °C, 25 °C/15 °C and 35 °C/25 °C) and an ambient (360 μmol mol-1) vs a doubled CO2 concentration (720 μmol mol-1) at 25 °C/15 °C, the optimum temperature for net CO2 uptake. 2. Root elongation occurred at soil temperatures from 12 °C (at 15 °C/5 °C) to 43 °C (at 35 °C/25 °C) with optimum temperatures of 27-30 °C, similar to other CAM succulents and consistent with the distribution of this shallow-rooted species in warm regions. Although a doubled CO2 concentration did not alter the optimum or limiting soil temperatures, increases of up to 5 °C in these temperatures accompanied the 20 °C increase in day/night air temperatures. 3. Root elongation rates at optimum soil temperatures ranged from 5.4 mm day-1 (15 °C/5 °C), through 6.6 mm day-1 (25 °C/15 °C), to 10.4 mm day-1 (35 °C/25 °C) with a 25% increase under a doubled CO2 concentration. Highest root elongation rates at 35 °C/25 °C may reflect changing root vs shoot sink strengths in a species with a highly plastic root system. 4. At limiting soil temperatures, the length of the cell division zone was reduced by an average of 20% and cell length at the mid-point of the elongation zone by 10%. Increased root elongation rates under a doubled CO2 concentration reflected increased cell elongation. 5. The temperature response for the roots of O. ficus-indica and stimulation of elongation by a doubled CO2 concentration indicate that root growth for this highly productive species should be enhanced by predicted global climate change.","CAM succulent; Climate change; Morphological plasticity; Root anatomy","climate effect; growth rate; soil temperature",,,,,,"Adams, R.M., Rosenzweig, C., Peart, R.M., Richie, J.T., McCarl, B.A., Glyer, J.D., Curry, R.B., Allen Jr., L.H., Global climate change and US agriculture (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-224; Aguirrezabal, L.A.N., Deleens, E., Tardieu, F., Root elongation rate is accounted for by intercepted PPFD and source-sink relations in field and laboratory-grown sunflower (1994) Plant, Cell and Environment, 17, pp. 443-450; Nobel, P.S., Low-temperature tolerance and CO2 uptake for platyopuntias: A laboratory assessment (1990) Journal of Arid Environments, 18, pp. 313-324; Nobel, P.S., (1994) Remarkable Agaves and Cacti, , Oxford University Press, New York; Rundel, P.W., Nobel, P.S., Structure and function in desert root systems (1991) Plant Root Growth: An Ecological Perspective, pp. 349-378. , ed.
