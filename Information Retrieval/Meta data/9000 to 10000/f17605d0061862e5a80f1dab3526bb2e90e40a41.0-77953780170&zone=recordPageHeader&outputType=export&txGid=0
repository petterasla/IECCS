Traditionally, these populations have been considered to be southern disjuncts of the southern flying squirrel (G. volans), a species that is widespread across the deciduous and mixed-deciduous forests of eastern North America. The limited number of museum specimens of Mesoamerican flying squirrels has made discerning the systematic and biogeographic relationships of these populations a challenge. We used ancient DNA techniques to extract, amplify, and sequence a 571-base pair segment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome-b gene from 22 of 34 available museum specimens. Mesoamerican flying squirrel data were combined with homologous sequences from representative populations of Glaucomys from the United States and Canada. This combined data set was analyzed using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results indicate that G. volans is monophyletic and contains 2 monophyletic subclades, 1 from Mesoamerica and the other from eastern North America. Our results have important implications regarding the nature of the historical biogeographic connection between the temperate biotas of Mesoamerica and eastern North America. The divergence of populations of G. volans in eastern North America from those in Mesoamerica appears to have occurred in the middle Pleistocene (approximately 0•75-0•5 × 106 years ago), considerably earlier than a late-Pleistocene connection previously hypothesized. Our analyses also show that populations of G. volans from eastern North America exhibit a clear signature of recent, rapid population expansion and that Mesoamerican populations of G. volans exhibit higher levels of genetic variability than those found across eastern North America. The documentation of substantial genetic diversity and population structure in Mesoamerican populations of G. volans is especially noteworthy because these populations face ongoing habitat loss due to human activities. Anthropogenic habitat degradation of the high-elevation forests these mammals inhabit likely will be exacerbated by global climate change. Therefore, we suggest that the conservation status of Mesoamerican flying squirrels be considered data deficient at a minimum with a high potential for future studies to reveal that many populations are near threatened or vulnerable. © 2010 American Society of Mammalogists.","biogeography; cytochrome b; flying squirrels; glaucomys volans; Mesoamerica; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; Pleistocene","Bayesian analysis; climate variation; conservation status; cytochrome; data set; deciduous forest; divergence; future prospect; genetic variation; geographical distribution; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; homology; human activity; maximum likelihood analysis; mitochondrial DNA; museum; phylogeography; Pleistocene; population structure; rodent; taxonomy; upland region; zoogeography; Mesoamerica; North America; Glaucomys; Glaucomys volans; Mammalia; Pteromyini; Sciuridae",,,,,,"Arbogast, B.S., Mitochondrial DNA phylogeography of the New World flying squirrels (Glaucomys): Implications for Pleistocene biogeography (1999) Journal of Mammalogy, 80, pp. 142-155; Arbogast, B.S., Browne, R.A., Weigl, P.D., Kenagy, G.J., Conservation genetics of endangered flying squirrels from the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America (2005) Animal Conservation, 8, pp. 123-133; Arbogast, B.S., Edwards, S.V., Wakeley, J., Beerli, P., Slowinski, J.B., Estimating divergence times from molecular data on phylogenetic and population genetic timescales (2002) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 33, pp. 707-740; Arellano, E., Gonzá, F.X., Lez-Cozá, T.L., Rogers, D.S., Molecular systematics of Middle American harvest mice Reithrodontomys (Muridae), estimated from mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences (2005) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 37, pp. 529-540; Avise, J.C., (2000) Phylogeography: The History and Formation of Species, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Bidlack, A.L., Cook, J.A., Reduced genetic variation in insular northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) along the North Pacific Coast (2001) Animal Conservation, 4, pp. 283-290; Bidlack, A.L., Cook, J.A., A nuclear perspective on endemism in northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) of the Alexander Archipelago, Alaska (2002) Conservation Genetics, 3, pp. 247-259; Bradley, R.D., Baker, R.J., A test of the genetic species concept: Cytochrome-b sequences and mammals (2001) Journal of Mammalogy, 82, pp. 960-973; Braun, J.K., Systematics and biogeography of the southern flying squirrel, Glaucomys volans (1988) Journal of Mammalogy, 69, pp. 422-426; Carleton, M., Sanchez, D.O., Vidales, G.U., A new species of Habromys (Muroidea: Neotominae) from Mexico, with generic review of species definitions and remarks on diversity patterns among Mesoamerican small mammals restricted to humid montane forests (2002) Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, 115, pp. 488-533; Ceballos, G., Galindo, C., Glaucomys volans goldmani (Rodentia: Sciuridae) in central Mexico (1983) Southwestern Naturalist, 28, pp. 375-376; Ceballos, G., Miranda, A., Notes on the biology of Mexican flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) (Rodentia: Sciuridae) (1985) Southwestern Naturalist, 30, pp. 449-450; Cook, J.A., A phylogeographic perspective on endemism in the Alexander Archipelago of the North Pacific (2001) Biological Conservation, 97, pp. 215-227; Dawson, W.D., Peromyscine biogeography, Mexican topography and Pleistocene climatology (2005) Contribuciones Mastozoológicas en Homenaje A Bernardo Villa, pp. 145-156. , Sánchez-Cordero and R.
