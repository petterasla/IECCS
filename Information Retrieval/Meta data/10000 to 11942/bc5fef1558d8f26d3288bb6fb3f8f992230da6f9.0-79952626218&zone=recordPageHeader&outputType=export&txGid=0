This cannot be explained by demographics, national income, geography and climate reasons only. Beyond the reasons for the current state of affairs, the main focus for the present study is to learn more on how the individual car buyer deliberates when considering buying a new automobile. Have there been any substantial changes in preferences, especially in regard to car size, engine choice and the type of fuel (energy source) used to propel the vehicle? Around the individual consumer there are a number of stakeholders that have a vested interest in affecting the choice of the individual consumer. Among these stakeholders, we find car producers, car dealers, importers, the government represented by many different agents, the automobile industry organisations, environmental organisations and representatives for the media. These stakeholders are all taking action in pursuing their interests and achieving their goals, which by nature are in conflict towards other stakeholders. The study maps the way these stakeholders act to affect the development of the new car market. All this is taking place in the midst of the present debate on global warming and increased fuel prices, which enhances the interest from most parties and stakeholders to navigate in these turbulent times of changing consumer preferences and car-buying patterns. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Automobiles; Consumer criteria; Fuel consumption; New car buying patterns; Stakeholder's perception","Automobile industry; Buying patterns; Buying practices; Car dealers; Car markets; Consumer criteria; Consumer preferences; Energy source; Fuel prices; New car buying patterns; Stakeholder's perception; State of affairs; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Gasoline; Global warming; Steel metallurgy; Automobiles; automobile; consumption behavior; engine; fuel consumption; perception; stakeholder; Sweden",,,,,,"(2008) Tax guide 08, , http://www.acea.be, ACEA, Accessed Feb 11, 2009, Available at; Andréasson, H., (2000) Resenärer i bilsamhället: Vardagligt resande i kulturell belysning, , (Diss.)
