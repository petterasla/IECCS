An ecosystem model, Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gases (VISIT), was applied to four sites in East Asia (different types of forest in Takayama, Tomakomai, and Fujiyoshida, Japan, and an Alpine grassland in Qinghai, China) where observational flux data are available for model calibration. The climate models predicted +1-3°C warming and slight change in annual precipitation by 2050 as a result of an increase in atmospheric CO2. Gross primary production (GPP) was estimated to increase substantially at each site because of improved efficiency in the use of water and radiation. Although increased respiration partly offset the GPP increase, the simulation showed that these ecosystems would act as net carbon sinks independent of disturbance-induced uptake for recovery. However, the carbon budget response relied strongly on nitrogen availability, such that photosynthetic down-regulation resulting from leaf nitrogen dilution largely decreased GPP. In relation to long-term monitoring, these results indicate that the impacts of global warming may be more evident in gross fluxes (e. g., photosynthesis and respiration) than in the net CO2 budget, because changes in these fluxes offset each other. © 2010 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.","Carbon-nitrogen cycle; Elevated CO2; Fertilization effect; Global warming; Leaf area index; VISIT model","carbon; carbon dioxide; rain; article; climate change; computer simulation; ecosystem; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental monitoring; Far East; geography; light; metabolism; methodology; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; radiation exposure; season; temperature; theoretical model; time; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Ecological and Environmental Processes; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Far East; Geography; Light; Models, Theoretical; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Rain; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Rogers, A., The response of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to rising [CO2]: Mechanisms and environmental interactions (2007) Plant Cell Environ, 30, pp. 258-270; Amthor, J.S., Respiration in a future, higher CO2 world (1991) Plant Cell Environ, 14, pp. 13-20; Asner, G.P., Scurlock, J.M.O., Hicke, J.A., Global synthesis of leaf area index observations: Implications for ecological and remote sensing studies (2003) Glob Ecol Biogeogr, 12, pp. 191-205; Badeck, F.-W., Bondeau, A., Böttcher, K., Doktor, D., Lucht, W., Schaber, J., Sitch, S., Responses of spring phenology to climate change (2004) New Phytol, 162, pp. 295-309; Boer, G.J., Yu, B., Kim, S.-J., Flato, G.M., Is there observational support for an El Niño-like pattern of future global warming?
