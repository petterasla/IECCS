More and more evidences suggested that improving photosynthesis can substantially increase crop yields. The complexity of photosynthesis however makes experimentally identifying new ways to engineer higher photosynthesis inherently time-consuming and costly. Combining systems modeling with evolutionary algorithm makes it possible to identify optimal engineering options for future global climate change scenarios and simultaneously consider environmental constraints, such as with constant or even decreasing nitrogen fertilizer application in the field. This method enables in silico examination of a large number of engineering options which natural selection has not explored, for higher photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency. The new approach comes particularly timely for now when our society is facing serious challenges in food security and global climate change. The traditional reductionist's approach will continue generating critical knowledge required to support this systems biology method to engineering higher photosynthesis. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Energy conversion efficiency; Evolutionary algorithm; Photosynthesis; Systems modeling; Yield potential","Basic building block; Crop yield; Environmental constraints; Fertilizer applications; Food security; Global climate changes; In-silico; Natural selection; New approaches; Photosynthetic machinery; Systems biology; Systems modeling; Yield potential; Conversion efficiency; Crops; Energy conversion; Engineering; Evolutionary algorithms; Knowledge engineering; Machinery; Nitrogen fertilizers; Photosynthesis; Climate change; carbon dioxide; ozone; article; climate change; energy conversion; evolutionary algorithm; harvest; kinetics; mathematical model; metabolism; nonhuman; photosynthesis; priority journal; temperature; Models, Biological; Photosynthesis; Systems Biology",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Davey, P.A., Bernacchi, C.J., Dermody, O.C., Heaton, E.A., Moore, D.J., Morgan, P.B., Long, S.P., A meta-analysis of elevated CO2 effects on soybean (Glycine max) physiology, growth and yield (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 695-709; Atkin, O.K., Macherel, D., The crucial role of plant mitochondria in orchestrating drought tolerance (2009) Annals of Botany, 103, pp. 581-597; Barnola, J.M., Raynaud, D., Lorius, C., Barkov, N.I., (1999) Historical CO2 record from the Vostok ice core, , In: Trends: A compendium of Data on Global Change.
