Emission trajectory and mitigation policies for India are analyzed using two models, a bottom-up energy systems optimization model (MARKAL) and a top-down macroeconomic model (Second Generation Model (SGM)). MARKAL is used to analyze technologies, peak electricity demand, carbon taxes, and a range of different policy scenarios. Carbon taxes and emissions permits are analyzed using SGM. In the reference scenario, energy use and carbon emissions increase nearly fourfold between 1995 and 2035. The analysis indicates that investment in infrastructure can substantially lower energy intensity and carbon intensity. A high carbon tax induces the substitution of natural gas and renewable energy for coal, and also causes a significant decrease in gross national product and consumption. The limitations of present models for analyzing mitigation policies for developing countries are discussed. Improvements for realistic representation of developing country dynamics and a policy agenda for GHG mitigation studies in developing countries are proposed.",,"climate change; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas emissions; modelling approach; policy options; India",,,,,,"(1992) United Nations Framework Convention on Climate-Text, 5p. , UNEP/ WMO Unit on Climate Change, Geneva; Hourcade, J.C., Modelling long-run scenarios, methodology lessons from a prospective study on a low CO2 intensity country (1993) Energy Policy, 21, pp. 309-325; Grubb, M., Edmonds, J., Ten Brink, P., Morrison, M., The costs of limiting fossil-fuel CO2 emissions: A survey and analysis (1993) Ann.
