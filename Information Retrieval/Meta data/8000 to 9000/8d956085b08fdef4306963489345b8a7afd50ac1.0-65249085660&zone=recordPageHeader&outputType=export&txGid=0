The effects of temperature and precipitation on net crop revenues are analyzed using cross-sectional data consisting of both rainfed and irrigated farms. Based on survey data from 8,405 households across 28 provinces, the results suggest that global warming is likely to be harmful to rainfed farms but beneficial to irrigated farms. The net impacts will be only mildly harmful at first, but the damages will grow over time. The impacts also vary by region. Farms in the Southeast will only be mildly affected but farms in the Northeast and Northwest will bear the largest damages. However, the study does not capture the indirect effects on farms of possible changes in water flow, which may be important in China. © 2009 International Association of Agricultural Economists.","Agriculture; China; Climate change; Impacts; Ricardian model","agricultural economics; climate effect; global warming; irrigation system; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; water flow; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,,,,,"Adams, R., Fleming, R., Chang, C., McCarl, B., Rosenzweig, C., A reassessment of the economic-effects of global climate-change on US agriculture (1995) Clim.
