After greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols probably exert the next largest anthropogenic radiative forcing of the atmosphere 3, but their influence on global mean warming has not been assessed using such models. Here we use a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model to simulate past and future climate since the beginning of the near-global instrumental surface-temperature record , and include the effects of the scattering of radiation by sulphate aerosols. The inclusion of sulphate aerosols significantly improves the agreement with observed global mean and large-scale patterns of temperature in recent decades, although the improvement in simulations of specific regions is equivocal. We predict a future global mean warming of 0.3 K per decade for greenhouse gases alone, or 0.2 K per decade with sulphate aerosol forcing included. By 2050, all land areas have warmed in our simulations, despite strong negative radiative forcing in some regions. These model results suggest that global warming could accelerate as greenhouse-gas forcing begins to dominate over sulphate aerosol forcing.",,"global warming; greenhouse gas; ocean/atmosphere GCM; sulphate aerosol",,,,,,,"Mitchell, J.F.B.; Hadley Ctr.
