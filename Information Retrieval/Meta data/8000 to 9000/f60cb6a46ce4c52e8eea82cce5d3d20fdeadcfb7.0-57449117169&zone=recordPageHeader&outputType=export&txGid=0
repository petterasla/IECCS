However, measurement of soil moisture alone may not be enough to elucidate plant responses to precipitation pulses, as edaphic factors may influence productivity when soil moisture is adequate. • The first objective of the study was to determine the responses of the aboveground annual net primary productivity (ANPP) of three perennial species (from different functional groups) in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland to variation in natural precipitation (annual and seasonal) and a 25% increase in seasonal precipitation (supplemental watering in summer and winter). Secondly, ANPP responses to other key environmental and soil parameters were explored during dry, average, and wet years over a 5-yr period. • ANPP predictors for each species were dynamic. High ANPP in Dasylirion leiophyllum was positively associated with higher soil NH4-N and frequent larger precipitation events, while that in Bouteloua curtipendula was positively correlated with frequent small summer precipitation events with short inter-pulse periods and supplemental winter water. Opuntia phaeacantha was responsive to small precipitation events with short inter-pulse periods. • Although several studies have shown ANPP increases with increases in precipitation and soil moisture in desert systems, this was not observed here as a universal predictor of ANPP, particularly in dry years. © The Authors (2008).","Aboveground annual net primary productivity (ANPP); Chihuahuan desert; Desert grasslands; Global climate change; Precipitation","rain; climate change; desert; environmental factor; grassland; net primary production; perennial plant; precipitation (climatology); soil moisture; soil water; water availability; adaptation; angiosperm; article; biomass; desert climate; growth, development and aging; Opuntia; Poaceae; soil; United States; Adaptation, Physiological; Biomass; Desert Climate; Liliaceae; Opuntia; Poaceae; Rain; Soil; Texas; Bouteloua curtipendula; Dasylirion leiophyllum; Opuntia; Opuntia phaeacantha",,"Soil",,,,"Aide, M., Aide, C., Dolde, J., Guffey, C., Geochemical indicators of external additions to soils in Big Bend National Park, Texas (2003) Soil Science, 168, pp. 200-208; Austin, A.T., Yahdjian, L., Stark, J.M., Belnap, J., Porporato, A., Norton, U., Ravetta, D., Schaeffer, S.M., Water pulses and biogeochemical cycles in arid and semiarid ecosystems (2004) Oecologia, 141, pp. 221-235; Barker, D.H., Vanier, C., Naumburg, E., Charlet, T.N., Nielsen, K.M., Newingham, B.A., Smith, S.D., Enhanced monsoon precipitation and nitrogen deposition affect leaf traits and photosynthesis differently in spring and summer in the desert shrub Larrea tridentata (2006) New Phytologist, 169, pp. 799-808; Bates, J.D., Svejcar, T., Miller, R.F., Angell, R.A., The effects of precipitation timing on sagebrush steppe vegetation (2006) Journal of Arid Environments, 64, pp. 670-697; Bell, C., McIntyre, N., Cox, S., Tissue, D., Zak, J., Soil microbial responses to temporal variations of moisture and temperature in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland (2008) Microbial Ecology, 56, pp. 153-167; Dougherty, R.L., Lauenroth, W.K., Singh, J.S., Response of a grassland cactus to frequency and size of rainfall events in a North American shortgrass steppe (1996) Journal of Ecology, 84, pp. 177-183; Field, A., (2000) Discovering Statistics Using SPSS for Windows.
