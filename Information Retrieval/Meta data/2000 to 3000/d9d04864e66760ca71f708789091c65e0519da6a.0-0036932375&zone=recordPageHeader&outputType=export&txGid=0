Early colonising stages (<30 years old) currently develop faster, and intermediate successional stages (30-50 years old) slower, than would be indicated by the long-term chronosequence pattern. These differences between the chronosequence approach and direct observation can be explained by a simple model relating the rate of community evolution to the temperature record. It would mean that an increase of 0.6°C in summer temperatures approximately doubled the speed of initial colonisation, whereas later successional stages were less sensitive to climate change. The present situation appears to result from unusually warm summers around 1950 and a warm period accelerating glacier retreat since 1980. In contrast to the long-term trend, all except the youngest communities have suffered a loss in diversity in recent years.","Alpine environment; Arthropods; Epigean fauna; Global warming; Primary succession","climate change; colonization; global warming; invertebrate; succession; Arthropoda; Invertebrata",,,,,,"Addington, R.N., Seastedt, T.R., Activity of soil microarthropods beneath snowpack in alpine tundra and subalpine forest (1999) Pedobiologia, 43, pp. 47-53; Bakker, J.P., Olff, H., Willems, J.H., Zobel, M., Why do we need permanent plots in the study of long-term vegetation dynamics?
