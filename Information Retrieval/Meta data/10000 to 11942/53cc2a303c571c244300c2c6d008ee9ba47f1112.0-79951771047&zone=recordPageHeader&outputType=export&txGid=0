Temporal changes in SOC stock are used to calculate terrestrial carbon sequestration rates used in global climate change models. The inherent variability in soil properties like SOC and p b means that larger sample sizes may be needed to accurately determine SOC stocks. Our objective was to calculate the minimum sample size required to detect changes in p b, SOC, and SOC stock for two land uses. Surface soils (0-5 cm) from two reclaimed mine soils and two managed hay fields in northern West Virginia were intensively sampled (60-74 samples each). Mean SOC and SOC stock values were larger in the hay fields (40 g/kg, 29 Mg ha -1) than in the mine soils (20 g/kg, 20 Mg ha -1), but p b was larger in reclaimed mine soils (1.4 g cm -3) than in hay field soils (1.2 g cm -3). The p b variance was larger in mine soils than that in hay field soils, but field variances for a given land use were similar (0.09 and 0.11 [g cm -3] 2 in mine soils; 0.02 and 0.03 [g cm -3] 2 in hay field soils). The variances in SOC concentration and SOC stock were not related to land use and were not similar within a land use. As a result, the minimum number of samples required to detect a change in p b, SOC, and SOC stock was a site-specific property and cannot be assumed a priori.
