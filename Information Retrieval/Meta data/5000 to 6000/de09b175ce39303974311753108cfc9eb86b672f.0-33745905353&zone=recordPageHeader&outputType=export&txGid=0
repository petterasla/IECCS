Fluid samples obtained from the injection and observation wells before CO2 injection showed a Na-Ca-Cl-type brine with 93,000 mg/L total dissolved solids (TDS) at near saturation with CH4 at reservoir conditions. Following CO2 breakthrough, samples showed sharp drops in pH (6.5-5.7), pronounced increases in alkalinity (100-3000 mg/L as HCO3) and Fe (30-1100 mg/L), and significant shifts in the isotopic compositions of H2O, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and CH4. Geochemical modeling indicates that brine pH would have dropped lower but for the buffering by dissolution of carbonate and iron oxyhydroxides. This rapid dissolution of carbonate and other minerals could ultimately create pathways in the rock seals or well cements for CO2 and brine leakage. Dissolution of minerals, especially iron oxyhydroxides, could mobilize toxic trace metals and, where residual oil or suitable organics are present, the injected CO2 could also mobilize toxic organic compounds. Environmental impacts could be major if large brine volumes with mobilized toxic metals and organics migrated into potable groundwater. The δ18O values for brine and CO2 samples indicate that supercritical CO2 comprises ∼50% of pore-fluid volume ∼6 mo after the end of injection. Postinjection sampling, coupled with geochemical modeling, indicates that the brine gradually will return to its preinjection composition. © 2006 Geological Society of America.","Basinal formation water; Chemical composition of fluid; CO2 storage; Frio Formation; Global warming","Basinal formation water; Gas-water-rock interactions; Greenhouse gases; Sedimentary basins; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Environmental impact; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Geochemistry; carbon dioxide; fluid composition; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon reservoir; sedimentary basin; water-rock interaction",,,,,,"Broecker, W.S., The Holocene CO2 rise: Anthropogenic or natural (2006) Eos (Transactions, American Geophysical Union), 87, p. 27; Clark, I.D., Fritz, P., (1997) Environmental Isotopes in Hydrogeology, 328. , Boca Raton, Florida, CRC Press; Freifeld, B.M., Trautz, R.C., Kharaka, Y.K., Phelps, T.J., Myer, L.R., Hovorka, S.D., Collins, D.J., The U-tube: A novel system for acquiring borehole fluid samples from a deep geologic CO2 sequestration experiment (2005) Journal of Geophysical Research, 110, pp. B10203. , doi: 10.1029/2005JB003735; Hepple, R.P., Benson, S.M., Geologic storage of carbon dioxide as a climate change mitigation strategy; performance requirements and the implications of surface seepage (2005) Environmental Geology, 47, pp. 576-585. , doi: 10.1007/s00254-004-1181-2; Hitchon, B., Aquifer disposal of carbon dioxide (1996), p. 165. , Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada, Geoscience Publishing LtdHolloway, S., Storage of fossil fuel derived carbon dioxide beneath the surface of the Earth (2001) Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 26, pp. 145-166. , doi: 10.1146/annurev.energy.26.1.145; Hovorka, S.D., Benson, S.M., Doughty, C.K., Freifeld, B.M., Sakurai, S., Daley, T.M., Kharaka, Y.K., Knauss, K.G., Measuring permanence of CO2 storage in saline formations - The Frio experiment (2006) Environmental Geosciences, 13, pp. 103-119; Kharaka, Y.K., Hanor, J.S., Deep fluid in the continents: I.
