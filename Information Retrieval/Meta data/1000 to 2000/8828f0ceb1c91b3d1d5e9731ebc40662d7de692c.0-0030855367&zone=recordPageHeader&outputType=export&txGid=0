Comparison between the CO2 estimates reconstructed from carbon isotope studies for the past 150 Ma show good agreement with the predictions of a long-term carbon-cycle model based on mass-balance studies. Further, the CO2 estimates from these sources over the entire Phanerozoic show agreement with the fossil record of leaf stomatal density change - a feature inversely related to the concentration of atmospheric CO2. Isotopic studies on temporal sequences of fossilized terrestrial organic matter have contributed to palaeoecological studies on shifts in the dominance of plants with the C4 photosynthetic pathway in ecosystems and historical changes in the metabolic processes of leaves of individual species. The long-term perspective offered by these studies provides critical information for assessing the responses of biological systems to future global environmental change.","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Palaeosols; Photosynthesis; Stable isotopes","carbon; carbon dioxide; climate change; isotopic composition; palaeosol; photosynthesis",,,,,,"Andrews, J.E., Tandon, S.K., Dennis, P.F., Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the late Cretaceous atmosphere (1995) Journal of the Geological Society, London, 152, pp. 1-3; Beerling, D.J., Ecophysiological responses of woody plants to past CO2 concentrations (1996) Tree Physiology, 16, pp. 389-396; 13C discrimination by fossil leaves during the late-glacial climate oscillation 12-10 ka BP: Measurements and physiological controls (1996) Oecologia, 108, pp. 29-37; Birks, H.H., Woodward, F.I., Rapid late-glacial atmospheric CO2 changes reconstructed from the stomatal density record of fossil leaves (1995) Journal of Quaternary Science, 10, pp. 379-384; Chaloner, W.G., Mattey, D.P., Shifts in the δ13C composition of Salix herbacea L. leaves in response to spatial and temporal gradients of atmospheric CO2 concentration (1993) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, B253, pp. 53-60; Berner, R.A., Palaeo-CO2 and climate (1992) Nature, 358, p. 114; GEOCARB II: A revised model of atmospheric CO2 over Phanerozoic time (1994) American Journal of Science, 294, pp. 56-91; Bocherens, H., Friis, E.M., Mariotti, A., Pedersen, K.R., Carbon isotope abundance in Mesozoic and Cenozoic fossil plants.
