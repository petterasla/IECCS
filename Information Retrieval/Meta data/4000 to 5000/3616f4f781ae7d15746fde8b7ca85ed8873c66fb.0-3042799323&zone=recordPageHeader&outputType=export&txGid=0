We have developed a new technique for vertical profiling of CO2 and meteorological parameters through the atmospheric boundary layer and well into the free troposphere. Vertical profiling of CO2 mixing ratios allows estimates of landscape-scale fluxes characteristic of ≈100 km2 of an ecosystem. The method makes use of a powered parachute as a platform and a new Tedlar bag air sampling technique. Air samples are returned to the ground where measurements of CO 2 mixing ratios are made with high precision (≤0.1%) and accuracy (≤0.1%) using a conventional nondispersive infrared analyzer. Laboratory studies are described that characterize the accuracy and precision of the bag sampling technique and that measure the diffusion coefficient of CO2 through the Tedlar bag wall. The technique has been applied in field studies in the proximity of two AmeriFlux sites, and results are compared with tower measurements of CO2.",,"Boundary layers; Carbon dioxide; Diffusion; Greenhouse effect; Meteorology; Sampling; Biosphere; Greenhouse gases; Meteorological parameters; Environmental engineering; carbon dioxide; air sampling; atmospheric chemistry; boundary layer; carbon dioxide; greenhouse gas; mixing ratio; vertical profile; accuracy; air analysis; air sampling; article; atmosphere; biosphere; boundary layer; carbon dioxide measurement; climate change; concentration (parameters); diffusion coefficient; ecosystem; evaluation; global change; greenhouse gas; infrared radiation; meteorology; parameter; technique; troposphere; water vapor; Altitude; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Water; Weather; Wisconsin",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"(2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis: Contributions of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), , Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, U.K; Tans, P.P., Fung, I.Y., Takahashi, T., (1990) Science, 247, pp. 1431-1438; Pacala, S.W., Hurtt, G.C., Baker, D., Peylin, P., Houghton, R.A., Birdsey, R.A., Heath, L., Field, C.B., (2001) Science, 292, pp. 2316-2320; Fan, S., Gloor, M., Mahlman, J., Pacala, S., Sarmiento, J., Takahashi, T., Tans, P., (1998) Science, 282, pp. 442-446; Denning, A.S., Fung, I.Y., Randall, D., (1995) Nature, 276, pp. 240-243; Francey, R.J., Tans, P.P., Allison, C.E., Enting, I.G., White, J.W.C., Trolier, M., (1995) Nature, 373, pp. 326-330; Bakwin, P.S., Tans, P.P., (1995) Tellus, 47 B, pp. 535-549; Berger, B.W., Davis, K.J., Yi, C., Bakwin, P.S., Zhao, C., (2001) J.
