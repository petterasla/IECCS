Nitrous oxide fluxes subsequently were positively correlated with soil NO3 levels, indicating that the nitrification inhibitors indirectly controlled N2O emissions by preventing NO3 from accumulating in the soil. Carbon dioxide emissions from the root zone were generally not affected by ECC or nitrapyrin. Nitrapyrin and ECC addition to urea resulted in 980 and 459 g N ha-1 N2O being emitted the second year. Nitrification inhibitors appear to be a useful tool in mitigating N2O emissions in agricultural systems. -from Authors",,"calcium carbide; carbon dioxide emission; denitrification; nitrapyrin; nitrification inhibitor; nitrous oxide emission; USA, Colorado, Fort Collins; Zea mays; Agriculture; Environmental Impact; Irrigation; Nitrification; Soils; UREA; Irrigated Corn; Nitrous Oxide; Nitrogen Oxides",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027009388
