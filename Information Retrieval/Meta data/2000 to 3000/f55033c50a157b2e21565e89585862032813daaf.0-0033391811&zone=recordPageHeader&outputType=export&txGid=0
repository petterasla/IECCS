These topics are: (1) background to carbon taxes including environmental issues - global warming and CO2 emissions, fuel substitution and the encouragement of non-hydrocarbon fuel use; (2) climate-change convention and related conferences including those at Rio de Janeiro objectives and achievements, and Kyoto-objectives; (3) carbon-tax proposals, including implications for oil, coal and gas: (4) The OECD view including evolution of general taxes on hydrocarbons, the carbon tax as a government revenue-raising objective, CO2 emissions in the OECD; (5) the oil-producer's view including discrimination against oil, the impact on the incentives to use oil and gas; (6) the developing countries' view, including the need to increase fuel use for industrialisation, financial constraints on energy use, and CO2 emissions in the developing countries.",,"Energy marketing; Energy production; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy policy; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Global warming; Marketing; Taxation; Energy management; carbon emission; carbon tax; economic instrument; energy policy; energy use",,,,,,,"Al-Abdullah, A.Y.; Coop.
