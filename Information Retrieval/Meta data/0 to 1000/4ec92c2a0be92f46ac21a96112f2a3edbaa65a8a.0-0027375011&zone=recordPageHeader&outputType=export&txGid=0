Concerning the assessment of atmospheric hazards and risks the direct effects caused by exposure to the new chemicals and indirect effect caused by deposition to soil and surface water are accounted for in assessment systems. However, the potential impact of new chemicals on atmospheric processes is generally not included. In this paper procedures to estimate ""hazard potentials"" to quantify the potential risk of a new substance in atmosphere-related environmental problems are proposed and discussed. In particular, hazard potentials for the following topics are defined: &#x02022; * global warming; &#x02022; * ozone depletion; &#x02022; * photochemical smog formation; &#x02022; * acidification and eutrophication. Based on these ""hazard potentials"" atmospheric hazards and risks can be assessed. © 1993.",,"chemical compound; ozone; surface water; acidification; air pollution; eutrophication; hazard; photochemical smog; review; risk assessment; soil; soil pollution; water pollution",,"ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Toet, de Nijs, Vermeire, van der Poel, Tuinstra, Risk assessment of new chemical substances; system realisation and validation II (1991) Report 679102004, , RIVM, Bilthoven; Vermeire, van Iersel, de Leeuw, Peijnenburg, van der Poel, Taalman, Toet, Initial assessment of the hazards and risks of new chemicals to man and environment (1992) Report 679102006, , RIVM, Bilthoven; Toet, de Leeuw, Risk assessment system for new chemical substances: Implementation of atmospheric transport of organic compounds (1992) Report 679102008, , RIVM, Bilthoven; Van der Poel, Manual for PECKER (release 2.2): a computer program for the calculation of environmental releases of new substances (1991) Report 679102003, , RIVM, Bilthoven, the Netherlands; Junge, (1977) Fate of pollutants in the air and water environment, pp. 7-25. , I.H.
