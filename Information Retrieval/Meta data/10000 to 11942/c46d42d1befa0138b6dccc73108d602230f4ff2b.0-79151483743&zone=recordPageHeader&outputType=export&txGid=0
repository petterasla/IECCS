From the analyses of local WM strategic and planning documents we have identified the emerging of three different energy recovery strategies: established combustion of residual waste; pre-treatment of residual waste and energy recovery from Solid Recovered Fuel in a dedicated plant, usually assumed to be a gasifier; pre-treatment of residual waste and reliance on the market to accept the 'fuel from waste' so produced. Each energy recovery strategy will result in a different solution in terms of the technology selected; moreover, on the basis of the favoured solution, the total number, scale and location of thermal treatment plants built in England will dramatically change. To support the evaluation and comparison of these three WM strategy in terms of global environmental impacts, energy recovery possibilities and performance with respect to changing 'fuel from waste' market conditions, the LCA comparison of eight alternative WM scenarios for a real case study dealing with a large flow of municipal wastes was performed with the modelling tool WRATE. The large flow of waste modelled allowed to formulate and assess realistic alternative WM scenarios and to design infrastructural systems which are likely to correspond to those submitted for approval to the local authorities. The results show that all alternative scenarios contribute to saving abiotic resources and reducing global warming potential. Particularly relevant to the current English debate, the performance of a scenario was shown to depend not from the thermal treatment technology but from a combination of parameters, among which most relevant are the efficiency of energy recovery processes (both electricity and heat) and the calorific value of residual waste and pre-treated material. The contribution and relative importance of recycling and treatment/recovery processes change with the impact category. The lack of reprocessing plants in the area of the case study has shown the relevance of transport distances for recyclate material in reducing the efficiency of a WM system. Highly relevant to the current English WM infrastructural debate, these results for the first time highlight the risk of a significant reduction in the energy that could be recovered by local WM strategies relying only on the market to dispose of the 'fuel from waste' in a non dedicated plant in the case that the SRF had to be sent to landfill for lack of treatment capacity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Energy recovery; England; Gasifiers; Global warming potential; Local authorities; Local strategies; Market condition; Modelling tools; Municipal waste; Pre-Treatment; Recyclates; Relative importance; Reprocessing plant; Residual wastes; Solid recovered fuels; Thermal treatment; Transport distances; Treatment capacity; Commerce; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Fuels; Global warming; Heat treatment; Life cycle; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Planning; Recycling; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Energy conversion; fuel; energy efficiency; energy resource; environmental impact; landfill; life cycle analysis; recycling; waste management; waste treatment; article; combustion; electricity; energy recovery; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; heat; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; recycling; strategic planning; technology; United Kingdom; waste management; Electric Power Supplies; England; Models, Theoretical; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; England; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Astrup, T., Møller, J., Fruergaard, T., Incineration and co-combustion of waste: accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions (2010) Waste Management and Research, 27, pp. 789-799; Christensen, T.H., Gentil, E., Boldrin, A., Larsen, A.W., Weidema, B.P., Hauschild, M., C balance, carbon dioxide emissions and global warming potentials in LCA-modelling of waste management systems (2009) Waste Management and research, 27, pp. 707-715; Cleary, J., Life cycle assessments of municipal solid waste management systems: a comparative analysis of selected peer-reviewed literature (2009) Environment International, 35, pp. 1256-1266; Consonni, S., Giugliano, M., Grosso, M., Alternative strategies for energy recovery from municipal solid waste part A: mass and energy balances (2005) Waste Management, 25, pp. 123-135; (2007), http://www.defra.gov.uk, DEFRA,.
