The ongoing drought has placed immense pressure on the limited water resources and a perception that this may be the start of a persistent change from historical conditions. Several studies have suggested that part of the current drought could be associated with global warming, and many global climate model projections for southeast Australia are for a drier future on average. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate a global warming signal from the high natural variability observed over the last two centuries and revealed in palaeo-climate records. Historically, water resources planning have considered past climate variability over different timescales together with impacts of other drivers of water availability. Currently, projections of future climate are highly uncertain and they are best treated as multiple plausible futures. In the future, improved hydroclimate projections, with reliable probabilistic quantification of uncertainties, would help make more informed risk-based water sharing and management decisions. Given the current prolonged drought and predictions of a generally drier future in southeast Australia, it is prudent to plan for conditions that will be drier than those experienced in the long-term historical climate. For short-term and medium-term planning, the recent climate should be considered as one possible scenario because there is a need to manage the drought and there is every possibility that the drought will continue for some time yet (either under climate change or as part of long-term natural variability). © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Climate change; Drought; Planning and management; Rainfall; Runoff; Southeast Australia; Water resources","Climate record; Climate variability; Future climate; Global climate model; Management decisions; Natural variability; Probabilistic quantification; Rainfall; Risk-based; Southeast australia; Time-scales; Water availability; Water resources management; Water resources planning; Availability; Climate models; Climatology; Drought; Global warming; Rain; Runoff; Water resources; climate change; drought; global warming; rainfall; runoff; water management; water planning; water resource; Australia",,,,,,"Cai, W., Cowan, T., The SAM and regional rainfall in IPCC AR4 models: an anthropogenic forcing account for southwest Western Australia rainfall reduction (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L24708. , doi:10/1029/2006GL028037; Cai, W., Cowan, T., Dynamics of late autumn rainfall reduction over south eastern Australia (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35, pp. L09708. , doi:10.1029/2008GL033727; Cai, W., Cowan, T., Evidence of impacts from rising temperature on inflows to the Murray-Darling Basin (2008) Geophys Res Lett, 35, pp. L07701. , doi:10.1029/2008GL033390; Cai, W., Cowan, T., Sullivan, A., Recent unprecedented skewness towards positive Indian Ocean Dipole occurrences and their impact on Australian rainfall (2009) Geophys Res Lett, 36, pp. L11705. , doi:10/1029/2009GL037604; Chiew, F.H.S., Estimation of rainfall elasticity of streamflow in Australia (2006) Hydrol Sci J, 51, pp. 613-625; Chiew, F.H.S., McMahon, T.A., Global ENSO-streamflow teleconnection, streamflow forecasting and interannual variability (2002) Hydrol Sci J, 47, pp. 505-522; Chiew, F.H.S., Peel, M.C., Western, A.W., Application and testing of the simple rainfall-runoff model SIMHYD (2002) Mathematical Models of Small Watershed Hydrology and Applications, pp. 335-367. , V.
