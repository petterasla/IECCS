The 40-28 kaBP and 9.0-5.0 kaBP lake-expanding events, corresponding to the global warming periods, were mainly determined by the abundant summer monsoon rainfall brought by strong Indian monsoon, aroused by enhanced solar radiation at earth orbital precessional cycle. The 40-28 kaBP lake-expanding event, also called the great lake period or the pan-lake period, for several great lake groups had come into being by the interconnection of the presently isolated and closed lake catchments. The total lake area over the Tibetan Plateau was estimated at least up to 150000 km2, 3.8 times of the present, and the lake supply coefficients were about 3-10. The 9.0-5.0 kaBP lake-expanding, with a total lake area of 68000 km2, less than the above mentioned reflected the Indian monsoon rainfall less than that 40-28 kaBP. The expanded lakes at 19-15 kaBP and 13-11 kaBP, distributed in these basins with more or less existing glacial, indicated plenty of glacial meltwater discharged to balance evaporation on expansive lake surface. At the same time, the enhanced precipitation by the westerlies at 19-15 kaBP and by Indian monsoon at 13-11 kaBP plays an important role in maintaining the high lake level. Heinrich events greatly affected the evolution of climate system over the Tibetan Plateau, and thus gave a clear boundary of the high lake level change in the late Quaternary.","Glacial meltwater; Heinrich event; Lake-expanding event; Monsoon rainfall; Precessional cycle; The Tibetan Plateau","Catchments; Evaporation; Glacial geology; Global warming; Rain; Solar radiation; Westerlies; Lakes; Heinrich event; lake level; meltwater; monsoon; paleoclimate; Quaternary; China",,,,,,"Chen, Z., Lake retreat in Qinghai-Xizang Tibetan Plateau with additional reference to its climatic significance (1986) Oceanologia et Limnologia Sinica, 17 (3), pp. 207-216. , in Chinese; (1983) Quaternary Geology in Xizang, pp. 11-88. , Comprehensive Scientific Expedition Group, (in Chinese), Beijing: Science Press; (1984) Rivers and Lakes of Xizang, pp. 115-215. , Comprehensive Scientific Expedition Group, (in Chinese), Beijing: Science Press; Johnsen, S.J., Clausen, H.B., Dansgaard, W., Irregular glacial interstadials recorded in a new Greenland ice core (1992) Nature, 359, pp. 311-313; Heinrich, H., Origin and consequences of cyclic ice rafting in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean during past 13000 years (1988) Quaternary Research, 29, pp. 142-152; Boyle, E.A., Keigwin, L., North Atlantic thermohaline circulation during the past 20000 years linked to high-latitude surface temperature (1987) Nature, 330, pp. 35-40; Schulz, H., Rad, U.V., Erienkeuser, H., Correlation between Arabian Sea and Greenland climate oscillations of the past 110000 years (1998) Nature, 393 (7), pp. 54-57; Warren, L.P., Kutzbach, J.E., Monsoon variability over the past 150000 years (1987) Journal of Geophysical Research, 92 (7 D), pp. 8411-8425; Gasse, F., Arnold, M., Fontes, J.C., A 13000-year climate record from Western Tibet (1991) Nature, 353 (24), pp. 742-745; Li, B.Y., Main characteristics of the environmental changes on the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau-Lake development (1998) Uplift and Environmental Changes of Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau in the Late Cenozoic, pp. 331-346. , (eds.
