Different studies monitoring pH ranges, global temperature, and factors effecting climatic conditions of an area, are discussed. A probable of climatic change, which in the way to become warmer, may result in a more frigid conditions, is also predicted. Some companies and socially responsible investors, however, have started to consider responsible environmental policies as a feature of good economics.",,"Climate change; Coastal zones; Geographical regions; Oceanography; pH effects; Sea level; Space surveillance; Stoichiometry; Strategic planning; Temperature distribution; Titration; Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS); National parks; Organic matter; Surface temperature; Environmental impact",,,,,,"Drought exposes cracks in India's monsoon model (2002) Science, 297 (5585), p. 1265; Calvin, W., The great climate flip-flop (1998) Atlantic Monthly, 281 (1), pp. 47-64; Fields, S., Cooling from warming (1996) Earth, 5 (2), p. 11; Wood, A.R., Mild winters may be in for sea change (2002) The Philadelphia Sunday Inquirer, pp. A20. , (Dec 8), or twood@phillynew.com; Lemsley, B., The new ice age (2002) Discover, 23 (9), pp. 34-41; Peterson, B.J., Holmes, R.M., McClelland, J.W., Increasing river discharge to the Arctic Ocean (2002) Science, 298 (5601), pp. 2171-2173; Wilson, E.O., The bottleneck (2001) Sci Amer, 286 (2), pp. 84-91; (2003) BBC World News on PBS, a Production of the British Broadcasting Company, , Jan 1; Klesius, M., State of the planet (2002) Nat Geogr, 202 (3), pp. 102-109","Cerceo, E.; EMD Chemicals, 480 Democrat Rd., Gibbstown, NJ 08027, United States; email: ecerceo@emdchemicals.com",,,,,,,,00447749,,ALBYB,,"English","Am Lab",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-23344454173
