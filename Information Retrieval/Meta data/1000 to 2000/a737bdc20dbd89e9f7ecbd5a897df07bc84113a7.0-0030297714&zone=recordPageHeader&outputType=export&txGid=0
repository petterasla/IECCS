Under the terms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed in Rio de Janeiro during the June 1992 Earth Summit, the United States and other industrialized countries commit ted to balancing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels in the year 2000. Included in the treaty is a provision titled 'Joint Implementation,' whereby industrialized countries assist developing countries in jointly modifying long term emission trends, either through emission reductions or by protecting and enhancing greenhouse gas sinks (carbon sequestration). The US Climate Action Plan, signed by President Clinton in 1993, calls for voluntary climate change mitigation measures by various sectors, and the action plan included a new program, the US Initiative on Joint implementation. Wisconsin Electric decided to invest in a JI project because its concept encourages creative, cost-effective solutions to environmental problems through partnering, international cooperation, and innovation. The project chosen, a forest preservation and management effort in Belize, will sequester more than five million tons of carbon dioxide over a 40-year period, will become economically self sustaining after ten years, and will have substantial biodiversity benefits.","Activities implemented jointly; Belize; Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Global climate change; Greenhouse gas; Joint implementation","Biodiversity; Carbon sequestration; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; Public policy; Environmental protection; carbon dioxide; biodiversity; conference paper; environmental protection; forest; greenhouse effect; international cooperation",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Abdoo, R.A., It pays to move beyond your own back yard (1995) Environment Strategy America 1995/96, pp. 140-141. , Campden Publishing, London, 176 pp; Brokaw, N.V.L., Mallory, E.P., (1993) Vegetation of the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, Belize, p. 43. , Manomet Observatory and Programme for Belize, Manomet, Massachusetts; Hamm, M.F., ""Aren't you proud that I'm a Belizean too?"": Conservation in Belize (1995) Winging it, 7 (11), pp. 4-6. , 1; (1991) Management Plan for the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, 2nd Ed., p. 29. , Belize City, Belize; Shand, E.A., Debt-for-carbon swapping as a means of financing Joint Implementation projects (1995) 19th Annual Miami Conference on the Caribbean and Latin America, p. 7. , Paper presented 3-7 December 1995, Miami, Florida; Trexler, M.C., McFall, K.S., Building a CO2 mitigation portfolio: The future is now for carbon sinks (1993) The Electricity Journal, 6 (8), pp. 60-69","Cutright, N.J.; Environmental Process, Wisconsin Electric Power Company, 333 W Everett Street, Milwaukee, WI 53203, United States",,,,,,,,0364152X,,EMNGD,,"English","ENVIRON.
