The earliest rice cultivation may have dated back to 14 000 calibrated (cal.) years before present (YBP). The global warming at 9000 cal. YBP in the early Holocene brought the development of the rice cultivation to the middle Yangtze River basin. On the other hand, ancient rice-cultivating and piscatorial society met a crisis at 4200-4000 cal. YBP that was characterized by a significant cooling of the climate. This climate deterioration led the northern wheat/barley-cultivating pastoral people to migrate to the south and invade, ultimately bringing about the collapse of the rice-cultivating and piscatorial society in the Yangtze River basin. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2008.",,"Allerod; Bolling; climate change; cultivation; global warming; Holocene; rice; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Yangtze Basin; agriculture; article; China; climate; growth, development and aging; rice; Agriculture; China; Climate; Oryza sativa",,,,,,"Yasuda, Y., The origins of pottery and agriculture in East Asia (2002) The Origins of Pottery and Agriculture, pp. 119-142. , Yasuda, Y, ed, Lustre Press and Roli Books, Delhi, pp; Zhang, C., Early pottery and rice phytolith remains from Xianrendong and Diaotonghuan sites, Wannian, Jiangxi, Province (2002) The Origins of Pottery and Agriculture, pp. 185-191. , Yasuda, Y, ed, Lustre Press and Roli Books, Delhi, pp; Tsutsumi, T., Origins of pottery and human strategies for adaptation during the termination of the Last-glacial period in the Japanese archipelago (2002) The Origins of Pottery and Agriculture, pp. 241-262. , Yasuda, Y, ed, Lustre Press and Roli Books, Delhi, pp; Guo, R., Li, J., Than Nanzhuangtou and Hutouliang sites: Exploring the beginning of agriculture and pottery in north China (2002) The Origins of Pottery and Agriculture, pp. 193-204. , Yasuda, Y, ed, Lustre Press and Roli Books, Delhi, pp; (2000) The Origins of Rice Agriculture, Pottery and Cities, , Yan, W. and Yasuda, Y, eds, Cultural Relics Publishing House, Beijing, 197 pp, In Chinese with English summary; Yuan, J., Rice and pottery 10,000 yrs.
