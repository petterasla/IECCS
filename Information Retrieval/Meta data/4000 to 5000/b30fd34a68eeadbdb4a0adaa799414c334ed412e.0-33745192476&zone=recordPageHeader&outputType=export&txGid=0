We hypothesized that warming increases invasion of alpine lakes by low-elevation montane zooplankton by suppressing native competitors and predators. This hypothesis was tested by conducting a two-factor experiment, consisting of a warming treatment (13 vs. 20°C) crossed with three invasion levels (alpine only, alpine + montane, montane only), in growth chambers over a 28-day period. Warming significantly reduced total consumer biomass owing to the decline of large alpine species, resulting in greater autotrophic abundance. Significant temperature-invasion interactions occurred as warming suppressed alpine zooplankton, while stimulating certain imported species. Herbivorous invaders suppressed functionally similar alpine species while larger native omnivores reduced invasion by smaller taxa. Warming did not affect total invader biomass because imported species thrived under ambient and warmed alpine conditions. Our findings suggest that the adaptability of remote alpine lake communities to global warming is limited by species dispersal from lower valleys, or possibly nearby warmer alpine ponds. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biological invasion; Body size; Climate warming; Competition; Dispersal; Ecological trade-offs; Mountain lakes; Phytoplankton; Predation; Zooplankton","biological invasion; body size; global warming; phytoplankton; predation; zooplankton",,,,,,"Bohonak, A.J., Jenkins, D.G., Ecological and evolutionary significance of dispersal by freshwater invertebrates (2003) Ecology Letters, 6, pp. 783-796; Bradley, R.S., Keimig, F.T., Diaz, H.F., Projected temperature changes along the American cordillera and the planned GCOS network (2004) Geophysical Research Letters, 31, pp. L16210; Cáceres, C.E., Soluk, D.A., Blowing in the wind: A field test of overland dispersal and colonization by aquatic invertebrates (2002) Oecologia, 131, pp. 402-408; Donald, D.B., Vinebrooke, R.D., Anderson, R.S., Recovery of zooplankton assemblages in mountain lakes from the effects of introduced sport fish (2001) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 58, pp. 1822-1830; Downing, J.A., Rigler, F.H., (1984) A Manual on Methods for the Assessment of Secondary Productivity in Fresh Waters, , Blackwell Scientific, Oxford; Dzialowski, A.R., O'Brien, W.J., Is competition important to arctic zooplankton community structure?
