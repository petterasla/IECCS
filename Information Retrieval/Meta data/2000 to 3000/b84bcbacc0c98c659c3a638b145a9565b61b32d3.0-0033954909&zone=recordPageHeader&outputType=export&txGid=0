A causal chain of meteorological, hydrological, and ecological processes connected the NAO as well as winter and early spring meteorological conditions to planktonic events in summer leading to a remarkable memory of climatic effects lasting over almost half a year. The response of Daphnia to meteorological forcing was most probably a direct effect of altered water temperatures on daphnid growth and was not mediated by changes in phytoplankton concentrations. High spring water temperatures during 'high-NAO years' enabled high population growth rates, resulting in a high daphnid biomass as early as May. Hence, a critical Daphnia biomass to suppress phytoplankton was reached earlier in high-NAO years yielding an early and longer-lasting clear-water phase. Finally, an earlier summer decline of Daphnia produced in a negative relationship between Daphnia biomass in July and the NAO. Meteorological forcing of the seasonal plankton dynamics in Lake Constance included simple temporal shifts of processes and successional events, but also complex changes in the relative importance of different mechanisms. Since Daphnia plays an important role in plankton succession, a thorough understanding of the regulation of its population dynamics provides the key for predictions of the response of freshwater planktonic food webs to global climate change.","Daphnia; Ecological memory; NAO; Populations dynamics; Seasonal succession","climate forcing; community dynamics; plankton; trophic interaction; Europe; Cladocera; Daphnia",,,,,,"Achenbach, L., Lampert, W., Effects of elevated temperatures on threshold food concentrations and possible competitive abilities of differently sized cladoceran species (1997) Oikos, 79, pp. 469-476; Adrian, R., Deneke, R., Possible impact of mild winters on zooplankton succession in eutrophic lakes of the Atlantic European area (1996) Freshwater Biol, 36, pp. 757-770; Adrian, R., Deneke, R., Mischke, U., Stellmacher, R., Lederer, P., A long-term study of the Heiligensee (1975-1992): Evidence for effects of climatic change on the dynamics of eutrophied lake ecosystems (1995) Arch Hydrobiol, 133, pp. 315-337; Aebischer, N.J., Coulson, J.C., Colebrook, J.M., Parallel longterm trends across four marine trophic levels and weather (1990) Nature, 347, pp. 753-755; Anderson, W.L., Robertson, D.M., Magnuson, J.J., Evidence of recent warming and El Niño-related variations in ice breakup of Wisconsin lakes (1996) Limnol Oceanogr, 41, pp. 815-821; Angeli, N., Pinel-Alloul, B., Balvay, G., Ménard, I., Diel patterns of feeding and vertical migration in daphnids and diaptomids during the clear water phase in Lake Geneva (France) (1995) Hydrobiologia, 300-301, pp. 163-184; Arndt, H., Krocker, M., Nixdorf, B., Köhler, A., Long-term annual and seasonal changes of meta-and protozooplankton in Lake Müggelsee (Berlin): Effects of eutrophication, grazing activities, and the impact of predation (1993) Int Rev Ges Hydrobiol, 78, pp. 379-402; Barber, R.T., Chavez, F.P., Biological consequences of El Niño (1983) Science, 222, pp. 1203-1210; Barnston, A.G., Livezy, R.E., Classification, seasonality and persistence of low-frequency atmospheric circulation patterns (1987) Mon Weather Rev, 155, pp. 1083-1126; Bäuerle, E., Ollinger, D., Ilmberger, J., Some meteorological, hydrological, and hydrodynamical aspects of Upper Lake Constance (1998) Arch Hydrobiol Spec Issues Adv Limnol, 53, pp. 31-83; Beukema, J.J., Expected changes in the Wadden Sea benthos in a warmer world: Lessons from periods with mild winters (1992) Neth J Sea Res, 30, pp. 73-79; Davies, T.D., Viner, D., Jones, P.D., Changes in atmospheric circulation and climate over the North Atlantic and Europe (1998) Management of Lake and Reservoirs during Global Climate Change, pp. 1-13. , George DG, Jones JG, Puncochár P, Reynolds CS, Sutcliffe DW (eds) Kluwer, Dordrecht; Demers, E., Kalff, J., A simple model for predicting the date of spring stratification in temperate and subtropical lakes (1993) Limnol Oceanogr, 38, pp. 1077-1081; Eckmann, R., Rösch, R., Lake Constance fisheries and fish ecology (1998) Arch Hydrobiol Spec Issues Adv Limnol, 53, pp. 285-301; Eckmann, R., Gaedke, U., Wetzlar, H.J., Effects of climatic and density-dependent factors on year-class strength of Coregonus lavaretus in Lake Constance (1988) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 45, pp. 1088-1093; Fraedrich, K., Müller, K., Climate anomalies in Europe associated with ENSO extremes (1992) Int J Climatol, 12, pp. 25-31; Fromentin, J.-M., Planque, B., Calanux and environment in the North Atlantic.
