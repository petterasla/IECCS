Phenology of leaf emergence and flower production in saplings was not affected by soil warming. Mature trees and shrubs leafed out slightly earlier and in larger numbers in heated plots. Trees flowered earlier and in higher proportions in the heated plots in 1993 but not in 1992. Mean area per leaf per plant and leaf expansion rates in 1992 were greatest in control saplings of Acer pensylvanicum and Fagus grandifolia. Vaccinium corymbosum, a shrub, showed reduced leaf sizes under soil heating. Soil warming significantly enhanced relative diameter growth of woody individuals, especially shrubs, in 1992, an effect less pronounced in 1993. Species richness was lower in heated plots in both years. Disturbed but unheated control plots exhibited the lowest species richness overall. Changes in relative abundance of herbaceous species from 1992 to 1993 were highly variable, and not significantly affected by treatment. Total density of herbaceous species was highest in heated plots during April and May, reflecting accelerated emergence of Maianthemum canadense and Uvularia sessilifolia. From June through October control plots exhibited the highest stem densities, as numbers of the early emergents declined. Of all life forms, herbaceous species were most sensitive to soil warming. Their early appearance could influence carbon and nutrient acquisition dynamics under changed climatic conditions in deciduous forests. -from Authors",,"growth; life form; phenology; soil warming; temperate forest; USA, Massachusetts, Harvard Forest; Acer; Acer pensylvanicum; Fagus; Fagus grandifolia; Maianthemum canadense; Uvularia sessilifolia; Vaccinium; Vaccinium corymbosum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028995489
