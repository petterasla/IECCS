The initial temperature state of an ensemble member is correlated to the amount of global warming seen in that member. The correlation arises, in approximately equal amounts, by variations in the ocean heat uptake within the ensemble and a dependency of the strength of the atmosphere-surface climate feedbacks on the initial climate. This relationship provides a clear warning that some uncertainty in global change projections derives from the simulation of the mean state.
