Despite this, some species initiate flowering late in the season, but little work has been done on the reproductive ecology of such species. This work investigates the reproductive consequences of late flowering in Leontodon autumnalis var. taraxaci in alpine southwest Norway during two seasons. In addition, the effects of an experimental increase in growing-season temperature on growth and reproduction are also examined. The reproductive success of Leontodon decreased strongly as the flowering season progressed, possibly as a result of increased climatic severity and increased extent of pollen and resource limitation on reproduction. Experimentally warmed plants produced significantly more and heavier seeds, and flowered more than 1 wk earlier than control plants, showing that temperature conditions influence both reproductive processes and flowering phenology. The results suggest that this late-flowering alpine species will bloom earlier, reproduce more, and grow larger under global warming.",,"flowering time; growth; phenology; reproduction; temperature; Asteraceae; Leontodon autumnalis; Leontodon autumnalis taraxaci",,,,,,"Aune, B., (1993) Air Temperature Normals, Normal Period 1961-1990, , Oslo: The Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Aune, B., (1993) Precipitation Normals, Normal Period 1961-1990, , Oslo: The Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Bergman, P., Molau, U., Holmgren, B., Micrometeorological impacts on insect activity and plant reproductive success in an alpine environment, Swedish Lapland (1996) Arctic and Alpine Research, 28, pp. 196-202; Billings, W.D., Constraints to plant growth, reproduction, and establishment in arctic environments (1987) Arctic and Alpine Research, 19, pp. 357-365; Billings, W.D., Mooney, H.A., The ecology of arctic and alpine plants (1968) Biological Review, 43, pp. 481-529; Bliss, L.C., Arctic and alpine plant life cycles (1971) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 2, pp. 405-438; Callaghan, T.V., Emanuelsson, U., Population structure and processes of tundra plants and vegetation (1985) The Population Structure of Vegetation, pp. 399-439. , White, J.
