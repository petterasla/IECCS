We used Raster-based cellular automata and a Geographic Information System to study the spatial and temporal vegetation dynamics. The cellular automata model is implemented with IDRISI's Multi-Criteria Evaluation functionality to simulate the spatial patterns of vegetation change assuming certain scenarios of global mean temperature increase over time. The Vegetation Dynamic Simulation Model calculates a probability surface for each vegetation type, and then combines all vegetation types into a composite map, determined by the maximum likelihood that each vegetation type should distribute to each raster unit. With scenarios of global temperature increase of 1 to 3°C, the vegetation types such as Dry Kobresia Meadow and Dry Potentilla Shrub that are adapted to warm and dry conditions tend to become more dominant in the study area. © 2008 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"alpine environment; ecological modeling; GIS; global warming; maximum likelihood analysis; meadow; probability; shrub; tundra; vegetation dynamics; vegetation mapping; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Qinghai; Kobresia; Potentilla",,,,,,"Chapin III, F.S., McGuire, A.D., Randerson, J., Pielke Sr, R., Baldocchi, D., Hobbie, S.E., Roulet, N., Running, S.W., Arctic and boreal ecosystems of western North America as components of the climate system (2000) Global Change Biology, 6, pp. 211-223; Chapin III, F.S., Robards, M.D., Huntington, H.P., Johnstone, J.F., Trainor, S.F., Kofinas, G.P., Ruess, R.W., Naylor, R.L., Directional changes in ecological communities and social-ecological systems: A framework for prediction based on Alaskan examples (2006) The American Naturalist, 168, pp. S36-S49; Coulelis, H., Cellular world: A framework for modeling micro-macro dynamics (1985) Environment and Planning A, 17, pp. 585-596; Eastman, J.R., (2003) IDRISI Kilimanjaro Tutorial, pp. 61-123. , Manual Version 14.0.
