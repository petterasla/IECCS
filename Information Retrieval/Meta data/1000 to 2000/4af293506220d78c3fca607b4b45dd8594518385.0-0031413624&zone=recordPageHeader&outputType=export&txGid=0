Plantation losses were estimated for the Southern U.S. Commercial timber harvests are the principal cause of losses. Excluding harvesting losses, the annual survival rate is 98.4 percent. Wildfire, insects, and inclement weather are not major factors; diseases are the leading cause of mortality, but affect only a small number of plantations.","Carbon sinks; Global climate change; Risks; Tree plantation survival; Tree planting","afforestation; climate change; forestry production; global change; risk assessment; environmental impact assessment; global climate; insect; mortality; policy; review; risk assessment; survival rate; USA; Hexapoda; Insecta",,,,,,"Alig, R.J., Mills, T.J., Shackelford, R.L., Most Soil Bank Plantations in the South have been retained; some need follow-up treatments (1980) Southern Journal of Applied Forestry, 4, pp. 60-64; Climate Change Action Plan (1993) The White House, p. 50. , Washington, D.C; Hosmer, D.W., Lemeshow, S., (1989) Applied Logistic Regression, p. 307. , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Kurtz, W.B., Alig, R.J., Mills, T.J., Retention and condition of Agricultural Conservation Program conifer plantings (1980) Journal of Forestry, 78 (5), pp. 273-276; Kurtz, W.B., Noweg, T.A., Moulton, R.J., Alig, R.J., An analysis of the retention, condition and land use implications of tree plantings under the Soil Bank Program (1994) Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station Report, SR464. , the Forestry Incentives Program and the Agricultural Conservation Program. 86 pp. + app; McWilliams, W.H., Forest resources of Alabama (1992) Resour.
