As a consequence, the short-lived plant species including many exotics might have been dramatically increased in terms of both richness and abundance on our planet, while many long-lived species might have been lost. Such conclusions can be drawn from broadly observed successional cycles in both theoretical and empirical studies. This article discusses 2 major issues that have been largely overlooked in current ecosystem management policies and conservation efforts: i) life history constraints; and ii) future global warming trends. It also addresses the importance of these 2 factors in balancing disturbance frequency and intensity for optimal biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem management.",,"biodiversity; disturbance; ecosystem management; life history; succession; ecosystem; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; longevity; plant; reproduction; review; theoretical model; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Longevity; Models, Theoretical; Plants; Reproduction",,,,,,"Covington, W.W., Helping western forests heal (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 135-136; Dwyer, D., Gregorire, J.M., Malingreau, J.P., A global analysis of vegetation fires using satellite images: Spatial and temporal dynamics (1998) Ambio, 27, pp. 175-181; Grime, J.P., An ecological approach to management (1980) Amenity Grassland: An Ecological Perspective, pp. 13-55. , Rorison, I.H. and Hunt, R.
