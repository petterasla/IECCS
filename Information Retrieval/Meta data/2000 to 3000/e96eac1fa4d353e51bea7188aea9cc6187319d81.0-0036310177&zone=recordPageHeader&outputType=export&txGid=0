The index series constructed by modeling closely correlated to the observations for 19511999 (c.c. 0.72) and to the statistically reconstructed one for 1900-1950 (c.c. 0.51). The index series for 1900-1999 showed significant 80 a and 40 a periodicity. A minimum of persistence in seasonal variations of the index occurred in Autumn, which was called ""Autumn Barrier"". It may relate to the ""Spring Barrier"", found in the seasonal variations of SST over the Eastern Equatorial Pacific. The increasing trend shown in the index series for the 20th century may associate with the global warming caused by enhancement of greenhouse effect.","40a-period; 80a-period; Autumn barrier; Modeling; Subtropical High over the Western Pacific","article; atmosphere; autumn; correlation analysis; greenhouse effect; model; periodicity; seasonal variation",,,,,,"Zhao, Z., Chen, G., Wang, Y., Comprehensive analysis on the main physical factors impacting droughts and floods in China during the summer season (1999) Review on Climate Forecast, pp. 91-98. , National Climate Center (in Chinese); (1999) Climate Monitoring Bulletin (in Chinese), 10 (8). , Serial 107; Zang, H., Wang, S., Influence of sea surface temperature over Eastern Equatorial Pacific on atmospherical circulation of low latitudes (1984) Acta Oceanologica Sinica (in Chinese), 1, p. 16; Acker, T.L., Buja, L.E., Rosinski, J.M., (1996) User's Guide to NCAR CCM3, , NCAR Technical Note/TN-421+IA, Boulder, Colorado; Bath, L.M., Rosinski, J., Olson, J., (1992) User's Guide to NCAR CCM2, , NCAR Technical Note/TN-379+IA, Boulder, Colorado; Hack, J.J., Boville, B.A., Briegleb, B.P., (1993) Description of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM2); Kiehl, J.T., Hack, J., Bonan, G., (1996) Description of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM3), , NCAR Technical Note NCAR/TN-420+STR, Boulder, Colorado; Parker, D.E., Folland, C.K., Bevan, A., Marine surface data for analysis of climatic flucutations on internannual to century timescales (1995) Natural Climate Variability on Decade-to-Century Time Scales, pp. 222-228. , National Research Council (eds.
