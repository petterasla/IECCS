In this study, we combined soil fractionation with isotope analyses to examine SOM dynamics after nine years of experimental warming in a North America tallgrass prairie. Soil samples from the control plots and the warmed plots were separated into four aggregate sizes (&gt;2000 μm, 250-2000 μm, 53-250 μm, and &lt; &gt; 53 μm), and three density fractions (free light fraction-LF, intra-aggregate particulate organic matter-iPOM, and mineral-associated organic matter-mSOM). All fractions were analyzed for their carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, and δ13°C and δ15N values. Warming did not significantly effect soil aggregate distribution and stability but increased C4-derived C input into all fractions with the greatest in LF. Warming also stimulated decay rates of C in whole soil and all aggregate sizes. C in LF turned over faster than that in iPOM in the warmed soils. The δ15N values of soil fractions were more enriched in the warmed soils than those in the control, indicating that warming accelerated loss of soil N. The δ15N values changed from low to high, while C:N ratios changed from high to low in the order LF, iPOM, and mSOM due to increased degree of decomposition and mineral association. Overall, warming increased the input of C4-derived C by 11.6 %, which was offset by the accelerated loss of soil C. Our results suggest that global warming simultaneously stimulates C input via shift in species composition and decomposition of SOM, resulting in negligible net change in soil C. © 2011 Author(s).",,"aggregate size; decomposition; experimental study; global warming; isotopic analysis; particulate organic matter; prairie; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; soil stabilization; North America",,,,,"DEB 0078325, NSF, National Science Foundation; DEB 0743778, NSF, National Science Foundation","An, Y., Wan, S., Zhou, X., Subedar, A.A., Wallace, L.L., Luo, Y., Plant nitrogen concentration, use efficiency, and contents in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem under experimental warming (2005) Global Change Biology, 11 (10), pp. 1733-1744. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01030.x; Auerswald, K., Wittmer, M.H.O.M., M̈annel, T.T., Bai, Y.F., Scḧaufele, R., Schnyder, H., Large regional-scale variation in C3/C4 distribution pattern of Inner Mongolia steppe is revealed by grazer wool carbon isotope composition (2009) Biogeosciences, 6, pp. 795-805. , doi:10.5194/bg-6-795-2009; Balesdent, J., The significance of organic separates to carbon dynamics and its modelling in some cultivated soils (1996) European Journal of Soil Science, 47 (4), pp. 485-493; Batjes, N.H., Sombroek, W.G., Possibilities for carbon sequestration in tropical and subtropical soils (1997) Glob.
