Nutrient accumulation and use behaviour of two maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes were evaluated under low (22.4 ± 5°C) and high (28.8 ± 5°C) root-zone temperatures. In greenhouse study, hybrid maize (FHY-396) and indigenous variety (EV-7004) were sown in calcareous loam soil filled in pots. Shoot and root dry matter yield of both the genotypes was significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased at the higher RZT. On an average, shoot dry matter at the higher RZT was 38% more for hybrid and 52% for indigenous variety (EV-7004). Concentration and uptake of estimated nutrients (P, K, Cu and Zn) was significantly (p&lt;0.05) influenced by RZT. At the higher RZT, shoot concentrations of both Cu and Zn were increased by about 30%. There was 1.5-fold increase in P, 1.4-fold increase in K, 1.9-fold increase in Cu and 1.8-fold increase in Zn uptake at the higher RZT. Nutrient uptake (uptake g-1 root) and use efficiencies (shoot utilization efficiency and usage index) were significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased at the higher RZT. Genotypes also differed significantly (p&lt;0.05) for P and Zn utilization efficiencies. Conclusively, RZT had a pronounced role in nutrient uptake from soil and their use by plants and hence on plant growth.",,"Zea mays",,,,,,"Allison, L.E., Moodie, C.D., Carbonate (1965) Methods of Soil Analysis, Part 2: Chemical and Microbiological Properties, pp. 1379-1396. , (Ed.): C.A.
