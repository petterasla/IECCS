As a result, the discharged CO2 is now suspected to have caused the greenhouse effect and global warming problem. To overcome this CO2 emission problem, there is great interest, especially in Canada, to capture carbon dioxide and utilize it as a flooding agent for the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process. In the past few years, a number of feasibility studies and a few testing pilot projects on CO2 extraction from power plants were performed. However, their results have showed that even though it is technically feasible to extract CO2 from power plants, its cost is high for the EOR application in the current crude petroleum market. A major reason for the high cost is that the CO2 extracting process requires a substantial amount of energy. This paper demonstrates how cogeneration concepts together with optimization design strategies would help to reduce the CO2 production cost by utilizing low-pressure steams and waste-heats from various sections of the power generation processes for extracting CO2. The economics and technical feasibilities of these concepts are described and the practical implications given Western Canada's resources for EOR applications are discussed. © 1995.",,"Cogeneration plants; Cost effectiveness; Enhanced recovery; Oil well flooding; Separation; Waste heat utilization; Flooding agents; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Tontiwachwuthikul, Gelowitz, Kritpiphat, Cogeneration Concepts for Recovering CO2 From Fossel-Fuel Fired Power Plants (1993) the 5th Saskatchewan Petroleum Conference, , Petroleum Society of CIM and CANMET; (1992) Gas Turbine World Handbook; Miller, Soychak, Gosar, Economics of Recovering CO2 from Exhaust Gases (1986) Chemical Engineering Progress, pp. 38-46; Astarita, (1983) Gas Treating with Chemical Solvents, , 1rst Edition, A Wiley-Interscience Publication; John Wiley and Sons, The United States; Peters, Timmerhaus, (1991) Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers, , 4th Edition; Solar Turbines Incorporated, Cogeneration Systems, p.8Snyder, Depew, (1986) Coproduction of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Electricity, , Electric Power Research Institute","Tontiwachwuthikul, P.",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
