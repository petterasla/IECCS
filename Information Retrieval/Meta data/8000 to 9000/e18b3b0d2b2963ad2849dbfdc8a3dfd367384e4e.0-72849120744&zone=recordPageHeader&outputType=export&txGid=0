The purpose of this study was to investigate biology students' conceptual structures regarding global warming. Data were collected from 118 students using a free word association test. The results of this study have shown the conceptual structure of the participating students relating to global warming in its various aspects. It was seen that the participating students knew of, and could conceive of to a degree, at least one basic aspect of the global warming issue. However, it was also seen that the conceptual structure of these students relating to global warming was quite simple, superficial, and limited. Furthermore, it was determined that the conceptual structure of the participating students was based on the effects of this phenomenon rather than the causes and sources thereof. Moreover, these students had some alternative conceptions about global warming, and these alternative conceptions were similar to those determined during previous research. For example, some of the students were erroneously associating global warming with ozone layer depletion, skin cancer, and unleaded petrol. These results were compared with related literature and recommendations were developed. © Sila Science.","Biology students; Conceptual structures; Global warming; Word association",,,,,,,"(2007) The Physical Science Basis, , IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC; Andersson, B., Wallin, A., Students' understanding of the greenhouse effect, the societal consequences of reducing CO2 emissions and the problem of ozone layer depletion (2000) J Res Sci Teach, 37, pp. 1096-1111; Jeffries, H., Stanisstreet, M., Boyes, E., Knowledge about the ""Greenhouse effect"": Have college students improved?
