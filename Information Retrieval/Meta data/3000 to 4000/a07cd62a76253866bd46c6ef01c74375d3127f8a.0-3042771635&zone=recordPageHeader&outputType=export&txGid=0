The country's environmental policy considers that energy policy should take into account environmental problems and that a balance should be found between increases in energy demand are required for economic development and environmental concerns. Turkey's high rate of energy-related carbon emissions growth is expected to accelerate, with emissions climbing from 60 million tons in 2002 to almost 220 million tons in 2020. Carbon intensity in Turkey is higher than the western developed country average. Energy-intensive, inefficient industries remain under government control with soft budged constraints, contributing to undisciplined energy use. Planned industrial privatisations may close the oldest and most inefficient operations and modernize surviving ones. Elimination of energy price subsidies could stimulate energy conservation, reducing energy and emissions growth below current projections.
