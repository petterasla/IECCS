The research agenda developed at the workshop focused on three issues: a) the development of health models, b) the development of health scenarios, and c) the use of health models and health scenarios to inform policy. The agenda identified research gaps as well as barriers to the development and use of models and scenarios. This report summarizes the workshop findings.","Climate change; Health models; Health scenario development; Policy","adaptation; article; demography; environmental change; environmental health; environmental protection; geography; global climate; health care policy; health economics; human; medical decision making; medical research; priority journal; social behavior; United States; workshop; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollutants; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Risk Assessment",,"Environmental Pollutants",,,,"Albritton, D.L., Meira Filho, L.G., Cubasch, U., Dai, X., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., (2001), Technical Summary.
