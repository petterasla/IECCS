The implications of these two models on eventual atmospheric methance release, due to global warming, are briefly examined. The volume of methane hydrate within the uppermost 1 m of the hydrate stability zone and within 1°-2°C of the equilibrium curve, assuming in situ bacterial generation, is 0.93-6.32 × 1012 m3, or 0.0035-0.012% of the maximal estimated hydrate reserovir. Nevertheless this volume, if released uniformly over the next 100 years, is comparable to current CH4 release rates for several important CH4 sources. Corresponding CH4 volumes calculated using the fluid migration model are nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower. -from Authors",,"fluid migration model; gas hydrates; global warming; methane; methane hydrate; ocean; resource potential",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08866236,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028570181
