Few studies, however, have investigated the effects of environmental stresses on the short-term temperature response of dark respiration (Rdark) at the leaf level. We investigated the effect of shade and transient drought on the temperature sensitivity (Q10; the proportional increase in respiration per 10°C increase in temperature) of Rdark of Geum urbanum L. in controlled experiments. Shade effects were most pronounced following sustained, near-darkness, when rates of leaf Rdark at a set measuring temperature (25°C) and the Q10 of Rdark were both reduced. By contrast, rates of leaf Rdark and the Q10 of Rdark both increased in response to the onset of severe water stress. Water stress was associated with a rapid (but reversible) decline in rates of light-saturated photosynthesis (Psat), stomatal closure (g s) and progressive wilting. Re-watering resulted in a rapid recovery of Psat, gs and a decline in the Q10 of R dark (due to larger proportional reductions in the rate of R dark measured at 25°C compared with those measured at 14°C). The concentration of soluble sugars in leaves did not decline during drought (5-7 day cycles) or shading, but during drought the starch concentration dropped, suggesting starch to sugar conversion helped to maintain homeostatic concentrations of soluble sugars. Thus, the drought and shade induced changes in Rdark were unlikely to be due to stress-induced changes in substrate supply. Collectively, the data highlight the dynamic responses of respiratory Q10 values to changes in water supply and sustained reductions in growth irradiance. If widespread, such changes in the Q10 of leaf respiration could have important implications for predicted rates of ecosystem carbon exchange in the future, particularly in areas that experience more frequent droughts. © CSIRO 2008.","Light; Photosynthesis; Q10; Water stress","Climate change; Climatology; Dynamic response; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Plant shutdowns; Rhenium; Starch; Sugar (sucrose); Sugars; Water supply; Carbon exchanges; Controlled experiments; Environmental stresses; Global climate changes; Growth irradiances; Leaf levels; Leaf respirations; Measuring temperatures; Q<sub>10</sub>; Rapid recoveries; Respiratory responses; Soluble sugars; Starch concentrations; Stomatal closures; Sugar conversions; Temperature responses; Temperature sensitivities; Water stress; Water stresses; Drought; angiosperm; carbon cycle; concentration (composition); drought; environmental stress; homeostasis; leaf; photosynthesis; physiological response; respiration; shading; temperature effect; water availability; water stress; Geum; Geum urbanum",,,,,,"Armstrong, A.F., Logan, D.C., Tobin, A.K., O'Toole, P., Atkin, O.K., Heterogeneity of plant mitochondrial responses underpinning respiratory acclimation to the cold in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves (2006) Plant, Cell & Environment, 29, pp. 940-949. , doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2005.01475.x; Armstrong, A.F., Wardlaw, K.D., Atkin, O.K., Assessing the relationship between respiratory acclimation to the cold and photosystem II redox poise in Arabidopsis thaliana (2007) Plant, Cell & Environment, 30, pp. 1513-1522. , doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2007.01738.x; Armstrong, A.F., Badger, M.R., Day, D.A., Barthet, M., Smith, P., Whelan, J., Millar, A.H., Atkin, O.K., Dynamic changes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain underpinning thermal acclimation of leaf respiration (2008) Plant, Cell & Environment, 31, pp. 1156-1169. , doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01830.x; Atkin, O.K., Macherel, D., Invited Review: The crucial role of plant mitochondrial in orchestrating drought tolerance (2009) Annals of Botany, , in press; Atkin, O.K., Tjoelker, M.G., Thermal acclimation and the dynamic response of plant respiration to temperature (2003) Trends in Plant Science, 8, pp. 343-351. , doi: 10.1016/S1360-1385(03)00136-5; Atkin, O.K., Evans, J., Siebke, K., Relationship between the inhibition of leaf respiration by light and enhancement of leaf dark respiration following light treatment (1998) Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 25, pp. 437-443; Atkin, O.K., Edwards, E.J., Loveys, B.R., Response of root respiration to changes in temperature and its relevance to global warming (2000) The New Phytologist, 147, pp. 141-154. , doi: 10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00683.x; Atkin, O.K., Zhang, Q., Wiskich, J.T., Effect of temperature on rates of alternative and cytochrome pathway respiration and their relationship with the redox poise of the quinone pool (2002) Plant Physiology, 128, pp. 212-222. , doi: 10.1104/pp.128.1.212; Atkin, O.K., Atkinson, L.J., Fisher, R., Campbell, C.D., Zaragoza-Castells, J., Woodward, F.I., Pitchford, J., Hurry, V., Using temperature-dependent changes in leaf scaling relationships to quantitatively account for thermal acclimation of respiration in a coupled global climate-vegetation model (2008) Global Change Biology, , in press; Azcón-Bieto, J., Osmond, C.B., Relationship between photosynthesis and respiration.
