The aim of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the occurrence and abundance of the BHG foraging in urban areas in winter. The study was conducted in the city of Krakow (southern Poland) in four easily identifiable urban habitats: (1) areas with blocks of flats, (2) areas with congested housing, (3) detached single-family housing and (4) green areas. In each of these four habitats, 60 small (1-ha) plots were randomly chosen, and the bird's presence and abundance were noted. Results revealed that birds occurred most frequently and in the largest numbers in plots with blocks of flats and green areas as well as plots located close to rivers and water reservoirs. This highlights the importance of ecological corridors and stepping-stones for the presence of this species in the city. Food resources had no effect on the presence of the gulls but the abundance of the species was positively correlated with the number of litter-bins. This indicates that local food resources could be more important than large landfills for this species in urban habitats during winter. No human disturbance indices had an effect on the occurrence and abundance of the BHG. Higher temperature and lack of snow cover positively affected utilization of the urban habitats by the species that indicates that global warming may speed up synurbanization of the BHG. To control the number of BHGs in urban areas, we suggest preventing access to local food resources by placing litter bins with waste baskets that are inaccessible to animals. Also, the public should behave appropriately towards gulls and refrain from feeding them intentionally. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009.","Foraging; Global warming; Landscape; Movement; Urban ecology","climate conditions; food availability; foraging behavior; global warming; landfill; movement; snow cover; urban area; urban ecosystem; urban housing; wader; winter; Cracow; Malopolskie; Poland; Animalia; Aves; Larus ridibundus",,,,,,"Adamik, P., Pietruszkova, J., Advances in spring but variable autumnal trends in timing of inland wader migration (2008) Acta Ornithol, 43, pp. 119-128; (2007) Concise statistical yearbook of Poland, , Anonymous, Polish Central Statistical Office, Warszawa; Arlt, D., Part, T., Post-breeding information gathering and breeding territory shifts in northern wheatears (2008) J Anim Ecol, 77, pp. 211-219; Artemyev, A.V., Factors responsible for long-term dynamics of the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca populations in the taiga of Karelia, Russia (2008) Acta Ornithol, 43, pp. 10-16; Avilova, K.V., Eremkin, G.S., Waterfowl wintering in Moscow (1985-1999) dependence on air temperatures and the prosperity of the human population (2001) Acta Ornithol, 36, pp. 65-71; Belant, J.L., Gulls in urban environments: Landscape-level management to reduce conflict (1997) Land Urban Plan, 38, pp. 245-258; Belant, J.L., Seamans, T.W., Gabrey, S.W., Dolbeer, R.A., Abundance of gulls and other birds at landfills in Northern Ohio (1995) Am Midl Nat, 134, pp. 30-40; Belant, J.L., Ickes, S.K., Seamans, T.W., Importance of landfills to urban-nesting herring and ring-billed gulls (1998) Land Urban Plan, 43, pp. 11-19; Burton, N.H.K., Rehfisch, M.M., Clark, N.A., Impacts of disturbance from construction work on the densities and feeding behavior of waterbirds using the intertidal mudflats of Cardiff Bay, UK (2002) Environ Manag, 30, pp. 865-871; Butler, J.R., Macmynowski, D.P., Laurent, C., Root, T.L., Temperature-associated dynamics of songbird winter distributions and abundances (2007) Ambio, 36, pp. 657-660; Calladine, J.R., Park, K.J., Thompson, K., Wernham, C.V., Review of urban gulls and their management in Scotland (2006) A report to the Scottish Executive, p. 115. , Edinburgh; Chace, J.F., Walsh, J.J., Urban effects on native avifauna a review (2006) Land Urban Plan, 74, pp. 46-69; Chamberlain, D.E., Gosler, A.G., Glue, D.E., Effects of the winter beechmast crop on bird occurrence in British gardens (2007) Bird Study, 54, pp. 120-126; Cooke, A.S., Observations on how close certain passerine species will tolerate an approaching human in rural and suburban areas (1980) Biol Conserv, 18, pp. 85-88; Ditchkoff, S., Saalfeld, S., Gibson, C., Animal behavior in urban ecosystems: Modifications due to human-induced stress (2006) Urban Ecosyst, 9, pp. 5-12; Elliott, K.H., Duffe, J., Lee, S.L., Mineau, P., Elliott, J.E., Foraging ecology of Bald Eagles at an urban landfill (2006) Wilson Bull, 118, pp. 380-390; Erritzoe, J., Mazgajski, T.D., Rejt, L., Bird casualties on European roads-a review (2003) Acta Ornithol, 38, pp. 77-93; Fernández-Juricic, E., Avifaunal use of wooded streets in an urban landscape (2000) Conserv Biol, 14, pp. 513-521; Fernández-Juricic, E., Jokimäki, J., A habitat island approach to conserving birds in urban landscapes case studies from southern and northern Europe (2001) Biodivers Conserv, 12, pp. 2023-2043; Fortin, M.J., Gurevitch, J., Mantel tests: Spatial structure in field experiments (1993) Design and Analysis of Ecological Experiments, , S.
