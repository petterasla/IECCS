Water percolation rates of the lysimeters were adjusted to one of three values, about 0, 5, or 20 mm day-1, during the cultivation periods of the first 3 years by periodically opening water stopping valves installed at the bottom of the lysimeters. In the 4th year, water was drained by pumps at a rate of 0, 7.7, or 25 mm day-1, respectively. CH4 emission rates significantly decreased with an increase in the percolation rates. Total emission during a cultivation period ranged from 5.7 to 13.8, 0.6 to 4.8, and 0.1 to 0.3 g m-2 in the no-, moderate-, and high-percolation plots, respectively. The decrease in soil Eh during the cultivation periods was markedly retarded by water percolation. The critical initiation soil Eh of CH4 emission observed was around -30 mV at 5 cm depth. CH4 emissions during the fallow periods (from September to May) were equivalent to 14-18% of those during the previous cultivation period if the paddies were continuously flooded all the year round. Low soil temperature during the fallow periods was a major limiting factor for CH4 emission during these periods in the case of continuously flooded treatment.","Global warming; Paddy field; Soil Eh; Soil temperature; Water management","emission; methane; paddy field; rice; water percolation",,,,,,"Cicerone, R.J., Oremland, R.S., Biogeochemical aspects of atmospheric methane (1988) Global Biogeochem.
