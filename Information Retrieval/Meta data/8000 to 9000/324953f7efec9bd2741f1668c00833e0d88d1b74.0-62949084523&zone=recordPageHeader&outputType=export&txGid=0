In this study we assessed the impact that climate change scenarios may have on soil carbon stocks in Canada and examined the potential for agricultural management practices to improve or maintain soil quality. Historical weather data from 1951 to 2001 indicated that semi-arid soils in western Canada have become warmer and dryer and air temperatures have increased during the spring and winter months. Results from the Canadian Center for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM1,2) under two climate change forcing scenarios also indicated that future temperatures would increase more in the spring and winter. Precipitation increased significantly under the IPCC IS92a scenario and agreed with historical trends in eastern Canada whereas the IPCC SRES B2 scenario indicated very little change in precipitation and better matched historical trends in western Canada. The Century model was used to examine the influence of climate change on agricultural soil carbon (C) stocks in Canada. Relative to simulations using historical weather data, model results under the SRES B2 climate scenario indicated that agricultural soils would lose 160 Tg of carbon by 2099 and under the IS92a scenario would lose 53 Tg C. Carbon was still lost from soils in humid climatic regions even though C inputs from crops increased by 10-13%. Carbon factors associated with changes in management practices were also estimated under both climate change scenarios. There was little difference in factors associated with conversion from conventional to no-till agriculture, while carbon factors associated with the conversion of annual crops to perennial grass were lower than for historical data in semi-arid soils because water stress hampered crop production but were higher in humid soils. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Crops; Cultivation; Geologic models; Global warming; Soils; Adverse effects; Agricultural management practices; Agricultural soils; Air temperatures; Century models; Climate change scenarios; Climate modelling; Climate scenarios; Climatic regions; Coupled global climate models; Crop productions; Historical datum; Historical trends; Management practices; Model results; No tills; Perennial grass; Potential impacts; Semi-arid; Soil carbon stocks; Soil qualities; Water stress; Weather datum; Winter months; Climatology; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; global warming; humidity; land use change; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil quality; Canada; North America",,,,,,"Bellamy, P.H., Loveland, P.J., Bradley, R.I., Carbon losses from all soils across England and Wales (2005) Nature, 437 (7056), pp. 245-248; Campbell, C.A., Zentner, R.P., Selles, F., Quantifying short-term effects of crop rotations on soil organic carbon in southwestern Saskatchewan (2000) Can J Soil Sci, 80, pp. 193-202; Cutforth, H.W., McConkey, B.G., Woodvine, R.J., Climate change in the semiarid prairie of southwestern Saskatchewan: Late winter-early spring (1999) Can J Plant Sci, 79, pp. 343-350; Davidson, E.A., Janssens, I.A., Temperature sensitivity pf soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change (2006) Nature, 440, pp. 165-173; Flato, G.M., Boer, G.J., Warming asymmetry in climate change simulations (2001) Geophys Res Lett, 28, pp. 195-198; Flato, G.M., Boer, G.J., Lee, W.G., The Canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis global coupled model and its climate (2000) Clim Dyn, 16, pp. 451-467; Grant, B., Smith, W.N., Desjardins, R.L., Estimated N2O and CO2 emissions as influenced by agricultural practices in Canada (2004) Clim Change, 65, pp. 315-332; Hamilton, J.G., Delucia, E.H., George, K., Forest carbon balance under elevated CO2 (2002) Oecologia, 131, pp. 250-260; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M.V.D., Linden, P.J., Dai, X., Maskell, K., Johnson, C.A., (2001), p. 881. , IPCC.
