These studies showed an increase in wintertime rainfall over most mid-latitude continental regions when CO2 is doubled, an earlier snowmelt season and onset of springtime evaporation, and a higher ratio of evaporation to precipitation in summer. These factors led to large-scale increases in soil moisture in winter and decreases in summer. We find that the above processes are important in simulated summer drying in a newly developed climate model. In addition to these thermodynamic processes, we find that changes in atmospheric circulation play an important role in regional hydroclimatic changes. Additional experiments show that the atmospheric circulation changes are forced by the CO2-induced warming of the ocean, particularly the tropical ocean. These results highlight the importance of sea surface temperature changes for regional hydroclimatic changes.",,"Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Global warming; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Moisture; Soils; Atmospheric circulation changes; Hydroclimatology; Summer drying; Climatology; climate change; global warming; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; soil moisture; summer; thermodynamics",,,,,,"Giannini, A., Saravanan, R., Chang, P., Oceanic forcing of Sahel rainfall on interannual to interdecadal time scales (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1027-1030; Hoerling, M., Kumar, A., The perfect ocean for drought (2003) Science, 299, pp. 691-694; Hoerling, M.P., Hurrell, J.W., Xu, T., Tropical origins for recent North Atlantic climate change (2001) Science, 292, pp. 90-92; Kellogg, W.W., Zhao, Z.-C., Sensitivity of soil moisture to doubling of carbon dioxide in climate model experiments.
