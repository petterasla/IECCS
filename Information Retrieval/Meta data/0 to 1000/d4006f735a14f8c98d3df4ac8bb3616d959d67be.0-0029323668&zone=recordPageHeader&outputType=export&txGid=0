The work of the society is proposing a research and development outline of realization of desert greening as a measure against CO2 global warming, and investigation and research work was conducted to make the proposal. As the result, the basic ideas of arid land afforestation for CO2 control, were found out to be the following. (1) To make it effective toward reducing global warming, fixing more than one hundred million tons of CO2 is necessary. (2) To achieve the fixation, an afforestation scale of 100 km x 100 km is necessary. (3) CO2 fixation should be continued for a long period, about 100 years. Based on these ideas, Basic Concept of R &amp; D Activities for Realizing Deserts Afforestation which is consist of three main subjects of (1) designing of overall system of arid land afforestation, (2) establishment of individual technologies, and (3) Evaluation of the system, is proposed. © 1995.",,"Arid regions; Global warming; Land use; Revegetation; Arid land afforestation technologies; Carbon dioxide fixation; Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE); Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Environment Agency of Japan, (1992) Global Warming and Economic Growth; Okamoto, (1993) IEA International Conference on Natural Gas Technologies, p. 85; NEDO, U.N.
