I examined the role of species interactions on the population dynamics of the herb Thalictrum alpinum and the sedge Carex vaginata by removing the dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala over four growing seasons at Finse, in the alpine region of south Norway, Furthermore, by increasing temperature (open top chambers) and nutrient availability (nutrient addition), I assessed the effects of climate warming on biotic interactions. 2. Dryas removal increased the number of Thalictrum and Carex leaves, and flowering frequency of Carex. Flower stems and leaf stalks of Thalictrum, and the leaves of Carex, became significantly shorter following Dryas removal. Warming and nutrient addition increased vegetative plant growth, whereas warming alone had positive effects on sexual reproductive effort of the target species. My results suggest that there is both competition for nutrients, and a facilitative shelter effect of Dryas on its neighbours. 3. Species interactions affected population dynamics of Thalictrum and Carex. Interactions between the impacts of Dryas removal and abiotic factors on leaf production, suggested that interactions between Dryas and neighbouring species might be modified if temperature and, in particular, nutrient availability increase under global warming. 4. This study shows that both biotic interactions and abiotic environmental conditions may affect alpine plant population dynamics. Furthermore, it shows that climate change may modify species interactions. 5. Species interaction effects should be included in climate change experiments and in future models predicting plant community changes under global warming.","Biotic and abiotic factors; Competition; Dominant species; Dryas octopetala; Facilitation; Nutrient availability; Plant functional types; Population dynamics; Removal experiment; Warming","climate change; community response; competition (ecology); facilitation; global warming; plant community; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Finse; Hordaland; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; World; Carex; Carex vaginata; Dryas octopetala; Thalictrum; Thalictrum alpinum",,,,,,"Aarssen, L.W., Epp, G.A., Neighbour manipulations in natural vegetation: A review (1990) Journal of Vegetation Science, 1, pp. 13-30; Arft, A.M., Walker, M.D., Gurevitch, J., Alatalo, J.M., Bret-Harte, M.S., Dale, M., Responses of tundra plants to experimental warming: Meta-analysis of the international tundra experiment (1999) Ecological Monographs, 69, pp. 491-511; Aune, B., (1993) Temperaturnormaler: Normalperiode 1961-90, , Del Norske Meteorologiske Institutt, Oslo; Austin, M.P., Austin, B.O., Behaviour of experimental plant communities along a nutrient gradient (1986) Journal of Ecology, 68, pp. 891-918; Berendse, F., Interspecific competition and niche differentiation between Plantago lanceolata and Anthoxanthum odoratum in a natural hayfield (1983) Journal of Ecology, 71, pp. 379-390; Bertness, M.D., Callaway, R.M., Positive interactions in communities (1994) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 9, pp. 191-193; Bertness, M.D., Shumway, S.W., Competiton and facilitation in marsh plants (1993) American Nauralist, 142, pp. 718-724; Billings, W.D., Mooney, H.A., The ecology of arctic and alpine plants (1968) Biology Review, 43, pp. 481-529; Bret-Harte, M.S., García, E.A., Sacré, V.M., Whorley, J.R., Wagner, J.L., Lippert, S.C., Plant and soil responses to neighbour removal and fertilization in Alaskan tussock tundra (2004) Journal of Ecology, 92, pp. 635-647; Brooker, R., Carlsson, B.Å., Callaghan, T.V., Carex bigelowii Torrey ex Schweinitz (C. rigida Good., non Schrank; C. hyperborean Drejer) (2001) Journal of Ecology, 89, pp. 1072-1095. , Biological Flora of the British Isles; Brooker, R., Van Der Wal, R., Can soil temperature direct the composition of high arctic plant communities?
