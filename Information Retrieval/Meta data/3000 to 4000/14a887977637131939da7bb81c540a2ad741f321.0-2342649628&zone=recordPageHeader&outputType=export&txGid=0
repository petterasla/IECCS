As one of the major carbon reservoirs, oceans play an important part in the carbon cycle. In recent years, iron seems to give us a good news that oceanic iron fertilization could stimulate biological productivity as CO2 sink of human-produced CO2. Oceanic iron fertilization experiments have verified that adding iron into high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) seawaters can increase phytoplankton production and export organic carbon, and hence increase carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2, to reduce global warming. In sixty days, the export organic carbon could reach 10 000 times for adding iron by model prediction and in situ experiment, i.e. the atmospheric CO2 uptake and inorganic carbon drawdown in upper seawaters also have the same magnitude. Therefore, oceanic iron fertilization is one of the strategies for increasing carbon sink of anthropogenic CO 2. The paper is focused on the iron fertilization, especially in situ ocean iron experiments in order that the future research is more efficient.","CO 2 sink; Export organic carbon; Iron fertilization; Phytoplankton production","biological production; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; environmental issue; experimental study; global change; global warming; organic carbon; seawater",,,,,,"Abraham, E.R., Law, C.S., Boyd, P.W., Importance of stirring in the development of an iron-fertilized phytoplankton bloom (2000) Nature, 407, pp. 727-730; Bakker, D.C.E., Watson, A.J., Law, C.S., Southern Ocean iron enrichment promotes inorganic carbon draw down (2001) Deep-sea Res.
