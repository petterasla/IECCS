Allanaspides hickmani and Allanaspides helonomus were first described in the early 1970s from surface pools in buttongrass moorland in two adjacent watersheds in south-west Tasmania. Both of these catchments have since been inundated for hydroelectric power generation (Lake Gordon and Serpentine Impoundments). Surveys indicate that both species persist in a small number of highly fragmented populations on the margins of the two impoundments. A. hickmani and A. helonomus have extant Areas of Occupancy of c. 21 and 54 km2, respectively. We estimate that inundation resulted in the loss of 85-94% of the original range of A. hickmani and c. 78% of the original range of A. helonomus. Under IUCN Red List guidelines and National threatened species legislation A. hickmani but not A. helonomus may qualify for listing as Vulnerable (Area of Occupancy &lt;20 km2). At the present time only A. hickmani is listed as Rare under Tasmanian (State) threatened species legislation but A. helonomus merits the same listing under State legislation. Global warming appears to pose the most significant potential threat to Allanaspides species. © 2006 FFI.","Allanaspides helonomus; Allanaspides hickmani; Australia; Buttongrass moorland; Global warming; Inundation; Red List; Syncarida; Tasmania","catchment; conservation status; crustacean; Endangered Species Act; endemic species; flooding; global warming; habitat loss; range expansion; Red List; Australasia; Australia; Tasmania; Allanaspides; Allanaspides helonomus; Allanaspides hickmani; Anaspididae; Crustacea; Dactyloctenium radulans; Syncarida",,,,,,"Balmer, J., Whinam, J., Kelman, J., Kirkpatrick, J.B., Lazarus, E., A review of the floristic values of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (2004) Nature Conservation Report, , 2004/3.
