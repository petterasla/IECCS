Box 80208, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia","Investigation of preferred structures of planetary wave dynamics is addressed using multivariate Gaussian mixture models. The number of components in the mixture is obtained using order statistics of the mixing proportions, hence avoiding previous difficulties related to sample sizes and independence issues. The method is first applied to a few low-order stochastic dynamical systems and data from a general circulation model. The method is next applied to winter daily 500-hPa heights from 1949 to 2003 over the Northern Hemisphere. A spatial clustering algorithm is first applied to the leading two principal components (PCs) and shows significant clustering. The clustering is particularly robust for the first half of the record and less for the second half. The mixture model is then used to identify the clusters. Two highly significant extratropical planetary-scale preferred structures are obtained within the first two to four EOF state space. The first pattern shows a Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern and a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the second pattern is nearly opposite to the first one. It is also observed that some subspaces show multivariate Gaussianity, compatible with linearity, whereas others show multivariate non-Gaussianity. The same analysis is also applied to two subperiods, before and after 1978, and shows a similar regime behavior, with a slight stronger support for the first subperiod. In addition a significant regime shift is also observed between the two periods as well as a change in the shape of the distribution. The patterns associated with the regime shifts reflect essentially a PNA pattern and an NAO pattern consistent with the observed global warming effect on climate and the observed shift in sea surface temperature around the mid-1970s. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Clustering algorithms; Gaussian distribution; Global warming; Mathematical models; Principal component analysis; North Atlantic Oscillation; Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern; Planetary wave dynamics; Sea surface temperature; Troposphere; Atmospheric temperature; Clustering algorithms; Gaussian distribution; Global warming; Mathematical models; Principal component analysis; Troposphere; algorithm; empirical analysis; Gaussian method; general circulation model; global warming; multivariate analysis; North Atlantic Oscillation; Northern Hemisphere; planetary wave; principal component analysis; regression analysis; sea surface temperature; stochasticity; troposphere",,,,,,"Anderson, B.D.O., Moore, J.B., (1979) Optimal Filtering, , Prentice Hall, 357 pp; Berner, J., Linking nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity of planetary wave behavior by the Fokker-Planck equation (2005) J.
