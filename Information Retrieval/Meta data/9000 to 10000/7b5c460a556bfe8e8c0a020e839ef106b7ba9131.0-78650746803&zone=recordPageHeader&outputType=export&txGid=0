Despite successful large-scale simulations, regional climatology features prove difficult to constrain toward observations, with challenges including high-dimensionality, computationally expensive simulations, and ambiguity in the choice of objective function. In an atmospheric General Circulation Model forced by observed sea surface temperature or coupled to a mixed-layer ocean, many climatic variables yield rms-error objective functions that vary smoothly through the feasible parameter range. This smoothness occurs despite nonlinearity strong enough to reverse the curvature of the objective function in some parameters, and to imply limitations on multimodel ensemble means as an estimator of global warming precipitation changes. Low-order polynomial fits to the model output spatial fields as a function of parameter (quadratic in model field, fourth-order in objective function) yield surprisingly successful metamodels for many quantities and facilitate a multiobjective optimization approach. Tradeoffs arise as optima for different variables occur at different parameter values, but with agreement in certain directions. Optima often occur at the limit of the feasible parameter range, identifying key parameterization aspects warranting attention - here the interaction of convection with free tropospheric water vapor. Analytic results for spatial fields of leading contributions to the optimization help to visualize tradeoffs at a regional level, e.g., how mismatches between sensitivity and error spatial fields yield regional error under minimization of global objective functions. The approach is sufficiently simple to guide parameter choices and to aid intercomparison of sensitivity properties among climate models.","Climate model optimization; Metamodeling; Precipitation bias and sensitivity","article; climate; greenhouse effect; priority journal; sea surface temperature; sensitivity analysis; water vapor; Algorithms; Climate; Computer Simulation; Forecasting; Global Warming; Models, Theoretical; Temperature",,,,,,"Jackson, C., Sen, M., Huerta, G., Deng, Y., Bowman, K., Error reduction and convergence in climate prediction (2008) J Clim, 21, pp. 6698-6709; Severijns, C.A., Hazeleger, W., Optimizing parameters in an atmospheric general circulation model (2005) J Clim, 18, pp. 3527-3535; Jones, C., Systematic optimization and climate simulation of FAMOUS, a fast version of HadCM3 (2005) Clim Dynam, 25, pp. 189-204; Stainforth, D.A., Uncertainty in predictions of climate response to rising levels or greenhouse gases (2005) Nature, 433, pp. 403-406; Knight, C.G., Association of parameter, software, and hardware variation with large-scale behavior across 57,000 climate models (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 12259-12264; Kunz, T., Fraedrich, K., Kirk, E., Optimisation of simplified GCMs using circulation indices and maximum entropy production (2008) Clim Dynam, 30, pp. 803-813; Rougier, J., Sexton, D.M.H., Murphy, J.M., Stainforth, D., Analyzing the climate sensitivity of the HadSM3 climate model using ensembles from different but related experiments (2009) J Clim, 22, pp. 3540-3557; Mechoso, C.R., The seasonal cycle over the tropical Pacific in coupled oceanatmosphere general circulation models (1995) Mon Weather Rev, 123, pp. 2825-2838; Covey, C., An overview of results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (2003) Global Planet Change, 37, pp. 103-133; Biasutti, M., Sobel, A.H., Kushnir, Y., AGCM precipitation biases in the tropical Atlantic (2006) J Clim, 19, pp. 935-958; Dai, A., Precipitation characteristics in eighteen coupled climate models (2006) J Clim, 19, pp. 4605-4630; Zhang, G.J., Wang, H., Towardmitigating the double ITCZ problem in NCAR CCSM3 (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L06709; Allen, M.R., Ingram, W.J., Constraints on future changes in climate and the hydrologic cycle (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 224-232; Liw Fu, R., Dickinson, R.E., Rainfall and its seasonality over the Amazon in the 21st century as assessed by the coupled models for the IPCC AR4 (2006) J Geophys Res, 111, pp. D0211; Neelin, J.D., Munnich, M., Su, H., Meyerson, J.E., Holloway, C., Tropical drying trends in global warming models and observations (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 6110-6115; McWilliams, J.C., Irreducible imprecision in atmospheric and oceanic simulations (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 8709-8713; Taylor, K.E., Summarizing multiple aspects of model performance in a single diagram (2001) J Geophys Res, 106, pp. 7183-7192; Gleckler, P.J., Taylor, K.E., Doutriaux, C., Performance metrics for climate models (2008) J Geophys Res, 113, pp. D06104; Spence, J.R., Madhavan, M., Ewing, J.D., Jones, D.K., Lehman, B.M., Del Rio-Tsonis, K., The hedgehog pathway is a modulator of retina regeneration (2004) Development, 131 (18), pp. 4607-4621. , DOI 10.1242/dev.01298; Coello, C.A.C., Lamont, G.B., Veldhuizen, D.A.V., (2007) Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi-Objective Problems, p. 761. , (Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands), 2nd Ed; Branke, J., Deb, K., Slowinski, K.M.R., (2008) Multiobjective Optimization: Interactive and Evolutionary Approaches, p. 463. , Springer, Berlin; Marler, R.T., Arora, J.S., Survey of multi-objective optimization methods for engineering (2004) Struct Multidiscip Opt, 26, pp. 369-395; Price, A.R., Myerscough, R.J., Voutchkov, I.I., Marsh, R., Cox, S.J., Multi-objective optimization of GENIE Earth system models (2009) Philos Trans R Soc, A, 367, pp. 2623-2633; Shan, S., Wang, G.G., Survey of modeling and optimization strategies to solve highdimensional design problems with computationally-expensive black-box functions (2010) Struct Multidiscip Opt, 41, pp. 219-241; Wang, G.G., Shan, S., Review of metamodeling techniques in support of engineering design optimization (2007) J Mech Design, 129, pp. 370-380; Simpson, T.W., Peplinski, J.D., Koch, P.N., Allen, J.K., Metamodels for computer-based engineering design: Survey and recommendations (2001) Eng Comput, 17, pp. 129-150; Molteni, F., Atmospheric simulations using a GCM with simplified physical parameterizations.
