Efforts to anticipate adaptation of cropping systems may benefit from understanding the global warming effects within decades. This study quantitatively examines the temperature warming impacts during, respectively, growing season and seed filling on soybean yields by using data from long-term field fertilisation experiments from 1987 to 2004. Here we report that grain yields significantly decreased with rising temperature during growing season, whereas the effects of increasing temperature at seed-filling stage on crop yields were significantly positive. The results indicate that a further temperature increment during seed filling appears to decrease soybean system's risk of yield reduction. Importantly, we inferred that earlier occurrence of seed filling would increase the temperature of this period. The implication is that advancing the onset of soybean seed filling could be an effective adaptation option to global warming, providing an average yield benefit of ∼14% per 10 days before the present date. © CSIRO 2011.","adaptations; global warming; seed filling; soybean yield","adaptation; alternative agriculture; assessment method; crop yield; data set; fertilizer application; global warming; growing season; physiological response; quantitative analysis; soybean; temperature effect; yield response; China",,,,,,"Allen Jr., L.H., Boote, K.J., Crop ecosystem responses to climatic change: Soybean (2000) Climate Change and Global Crop Productivity, pp. 133-160. , Eds KR Reddy, HF Hodges CABI: New York; Cooper, R.L., A delayed flowering barrier to higher soybean yields (2003) Field Crops Research, 82, pp. 27-35. , doi:10.1016/S0378-4290(03)00003-0; Cutforth, H.W., McGinn, S.M., McPhee, K.E., Miller, P.R., Adaptation of pulse crops to the changing climate of the northern Great Plains (2007) Agronomy Journal, 99, pp. 1684-1699. , doi:10.2134/agronj2006.0310s; De Bruin, J.L., Pedersen, P., Soybean seed yield response to planting date and seeding rate in the Upper Midwest (2008) Agronomy Journal, 100, pp. 696-703. , doi:10.2134/agronj2007.0115; Dornbos, D.L., Mullen, R.E., Influence of stress during soybean seed fill on seed weight germination and seedling growth-rate (1991) Canadian Journal of Plant Science, 71, pp. 373-383. , doi:10.4141/cjps91-052; (2006) China Agriculture Yearbook 2006, , Editorial Board - China Agriculture Press China Agriculture Press: Beijing) [In Chinese]; Egli, D.B., Seed-fill duration and yield of grain crops (2004) Advances in Agronomy, 83, pp. 243-279. , doi:10.1016/S0065-2113(04)83005-0; Egli, D.B., Soybean yield trends from 1972 to 2003 in mid-western USA (2008) Field Crops Research, 106, pp. 53-59. , doi:10.1016/j.fcr.2007.10.014; Egli, D.B., Bruening, W.P., Water stress photosynthesis seed sucrose levels and seed growth in soybean (2004) Journal of Agricultural Science, 142, pp. 1-8. , doi:10.1017/S0021859604004095; Egli, D.B., Wardlaw, I.F., Temperature response of seed growth characteristics of soybeans (1980) Agronomy Journal, 72, pp. 560-564. , doi:10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200030036x; (2011) Statistics Database, , http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx, FAOSTAT Available at: verified 25 May 2011; Fehr, W.R., Caviness, C.E., Stages of soybean development (1977) Special Report, 80. , Iowa State University: Ames, IA); Ferris, R., Wheeler, T.R., Hadley, P., Ellis, R.H., Recovery of photosynthesis after environmental stress in soybean grown under elevated CO 2 (1998) Crop.
