The continuous injection of sulfur into the stratosphere has been suggested as a ""geoengineering"" scheme to counteract global warming. We use an empirical relationship between ozone depletion and chlorine activation to estimate how this approach might influence polar ozone. An injection of sulfur large enough to compensate for surface warming caused by the doubling of atmospheric CO2 would strongly increase the extent of Arctic ozone depletion during the present century for cold winters and would cause a considerable delay, between 30 and 70 years, in the expected recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole.",,"carbon dioxide; chlorine; ozone; sulfur; aerosol; carbon dioxide; ozone depletion; sensitivity analysis; stratosphere; sulfate; aerosol; Antarctica; Arctic; article; atmosphere; climate change; engineering; environmental temperature; geology; greenhouse effect; ozone depletion; priority journal; stratosphere; volcano; winter; Asia; Central Luzon; Eurasia; Luzon; Mount Pinatubo; Philippines; Southeast Asia; Zambales; Pinatubo",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; ozone, 10028-15-6; sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9",,,,"Crutzen, P.J., (2006) Clim.

The index accounts for projections of future abundances, the atmospheric lifetime of organic source molecules, and the relative efficiency of ozone loss by chlorine and bromine compounds (13). Here, a mean age of 5.5 years, appropriate for the polar regions, has been used (13)Newman, P.A., Daniel, J.S., Waugh, D.W., Nash, E.R., (2007) Atmos. Chem. Phys, 7, p. 4537; Tilmes, S., (2007) J.

Assessment of Stratospheric Aerosol Properties (report no. 4, Stratospheric Process and Their Role in Climate, World Climate Research Programme 124, World Meteorological Organization/TD-No. 1295, Toronto, 2006)SAD is proportional to sulfate mass/rmode, where rmode is particle mode radius. The large-aerosol case assumes a similar perturbation to sulfate mass as the small-aerosol case. Therefore, the rmode of the latter case, which is one-third as small as that of the former case, will result in a three times larger perturbation to SAD (21). Our estimate of SAD is derived from scaling the Mount Pinatubo perturbation based on information in (1, 2)G. A. Meehl et al., Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
