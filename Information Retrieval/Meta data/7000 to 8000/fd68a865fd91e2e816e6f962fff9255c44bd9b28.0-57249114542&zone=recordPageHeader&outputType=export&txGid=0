Biogas systems can help in the fight against global warming by avoiding to escape methane from organic waste, into the atmosphere. Biogas technology is of great benefit to the end-users and the environment by energy, compost and nutrient recovery. Romania is a country with a huge biomass potential. Implementing of biogas technology could be a proper solution for waste treatment and producing of electricity from renewable energy sources, as stipulated in EU and national legislation. Ibis paper presents an overview on the progress of biogas technologies in Romania since 1980s and the main obstacles that have slow down the development of this technology in the context of the major political and economical changes registered in Romanian industry after 1990. There are mentioned the main benefits which biogas plants could bring to the environment and also some common problems with biogas plants which have been noticed in the developed countries in this field.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas plants; Organic waste","Ibis",,,,,,"Balasubramaniyam, U., Buysman, E., Meriggi, N., Zisengwe, L., (2008) Biogas production in climates with long cold winters, Study prepared by Wageningen University, , The Netherlands, May, Wageningen; Břan, G., (2008) Achievements and Perspectives in Biogas Industry, , in Romanian, Printech Press, Bucharest, Romania; Bejan, M., Rusu, T., A renewable energy source - biogas from organic waste (2007) Bulletin AGIR, , January, March, 13-19; Bhat, P.R., Chanakya, H.N., Ravindranath, N.H., Biogas Plant Dissemination (2001) Journal Energy Sustainable Dev, 1, pp. 39-41; Butchaiah, G., Economic Urilisation of Biogas as a Renewable Fuel for Fuel Cell (2006) The 2nd Joint International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environment (SEE, , 21-23 November, Bangkok, Thailand. 2006; Ionel, I., Popescu, F., Ungureanu, C., Tordai, G., Biomass as a renewable energy resource in Romania (2006) Scientiffic Bulletin of Politehnica University of Timisoara, 2, pp. 424-456; Fischer, T., Krieg, A., (2005) Agricultural Biogas Plants - Worldwide, Krieg and Fischer Indenieure GmbK, , www.KriegFischer.de, On line at; Koopmans, A., (1998) Trend in energy use, Paper presented at the Expert Consultation on Wood - Energy, Climate and Health, , http://www.rwedp.org/acrobattp_ergtrend.pdf, Phuket, Thailand, October 7-9, 1998, On line at; Ofiteru, A., Adamescu, M., Bodescu, F., Biogas and biodiesel market prospects in Romania (2008) Publication of Big-East Project: Forum.newpower, Special, pp. 28-24. , http://www.bigeast.eu/downloads/downloads.html, On line at; Widodo, T.W., dan Elita, A.R., (2005) Waste management on cattle farm to increase added-value and environmental improvement, National Seminar on Agricultural Technology Efforts for Increasing Market Competitiveness and Agribusiness Infestation, , Batam, Indonesia, September 5-6; (2007) General Presentation of Agriculture and Rurale Development in Romania Statistic Report, , www.mapam.ro, MAPAM, On line at; (2006) Guidelines for the Producer of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources, , www.anre.ro, ANRE, On line at","Mateescu, C.; National Institute for Research and Development in Electrical Engineering, ICPE-CA, 313 Splaiul Unirii, 030138 Bucharest-3, Romania; email: carmen.mateescu@icpe-ca.ro",,,,,,,,15829596,,,,"English","Environ.
