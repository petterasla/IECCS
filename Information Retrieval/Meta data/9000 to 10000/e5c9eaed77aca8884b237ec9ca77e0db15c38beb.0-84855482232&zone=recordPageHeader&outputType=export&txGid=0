Less is known about phenological changes in herbaceous, semi-arid plant communities. We recorded first-bloom date of common spring wildflowers in a semi-arid grassland in the Rocky Mountains, USA from 1995 through 2008 and analyzed these data along with mean monthly temperature and precipitation. Advanced flowering predominated; 75% of the 32 species displayed a negative linear regression slope, and this trend was strong for nine species (slope < 1.0, p < 0.10). Only one species showed a strong trend for later flowering. Mean advance for all 32 species was 0.61 days/year and mean advance for the nine species displaying a strong tendency to flower earlier was 1.6 days/year. Species flowering early showed stronger trends toward advanced flowering than later species. Average March temperature and January plus December precipitation, falling mainly as snow, were explanatory variables in the best multiple linear regression model for mean first-flowering date of strongly advanced species. Our results suggest that flowering phenology may be changing faster and precipitation may play a more important role in semi-arid grasslands than in humid-temperate systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Advanced flowering; Climate change; Global warming; Montana; Phenology; Rocky Mountains","flowering; global warming; grassland; herb; linearity; phenology; plant community; precipitation (climatology); semiarid region; temperature effect; Montana; Rocky Mountains; United States",,,,,,"Abu-Asab, M.S., Peterson, P.M., Shelter, S.G., Orli, S.S., Earlier plant flowering in spring as a response to global warming in the Washington D.C. area (2001) Biodiversity and Conservation, 10, pp. 597-612; Beaubien, E.G., Freeland, H.J., Spring phenology trends in Alberta, Canada: links to ocean temperature (2000) International Journal of Biometeorology, 44, pp. 53-59; Bowers, J.E., Dimmitt, M.A., Flowering phenology of six woody plants in the northern Sonoran Desert (1994) Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society, 121, pp. 215-229; Bradley, N.L., Leopold, A.C., Ross, J., Huffaker, W., Phenological changes reflect climate change in Wisconsin (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 96, pp. 9701-9704; Chapin, F.S., Randerson, J.T., McGuire, A.D., Foley, J.A., Field, C.B., Changing feedbacks in the climate-biosphere system (2008) Frontiers in Ecology and Environment, 6, pp. 313-320; Caicedo, A.L., Stinchcombe, J.R., Olsen, K.M., Schmitt, J., Purugganan, M.D., Epistatic interaction between Arabidopsis FRI and FLC flowering time genes generates a latitudinal cline in a life history trait (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 101, pp. 15670-15675; Dahlgren, J.P., von Zeipel, H., Ehrlén, J., Variation in vegetative and flowering phenology in a forest herb caused by environmental heterogeneity (2007) American Journal of Botany, 94, pp. 1570-1576; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Harris, I.T.B., Williamson, M.H., Relationships between first flowering date and temperature in the flora of a locality in central England (1995) Functional Ecology, 9, pp. 55-60; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Friedel, M.H., Nelson, D.J., Sparrow, A.D., Kinloch, J.E., Maconochie, J.R., What induces central Australian arid zone trees and shrubs to flower and fruit?
