Consequently, the authors have proposed an integrated scheme called the ESS (Eco-load Standardization Scheme) to express the amount of environmental load from different causes, using an identical standard based on objective data. This is a 'Loader-Receiver Tolerant Balance Theory', which indicates the balance of the maximum tolerance value that the Loader can discharge or consume with the maximum tolerable value by the Receiver. This ESS employs the NETS (Numerical Eco-load Total Standard) as the unit for expressing quantitatively the integrated and standardized environmental load. This LCA-NETS scheme is applied to different energy systems such as various kinds of power plants and co-generation systems, and the LCA evaluations are discussed for further ecological improvement. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
