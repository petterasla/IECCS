Using time series methods, we find that cold ambient temperatures during gestation predict lower secondary sex ratios and longer life span of males in annual birth cohorts composed of Danes, Finns, Norwegians, and Swedes born between 1878 (earliest year with complete life tables) and 1914 (last birth cohort for which male life span can be estimated). We conclude that ambient temperature affects the characteristics of human populations by influencing who survives gestation, a heretofore unrecognized effect of climate on humanity. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate change; Global warming; Natural selection; Scandinavia; Time series","article; climate change; controlled study; environmental temperature; female; gestation period; human; lifespan; longevity; male; priority journal; sex ratio; time series analysis; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Longevity; Male; Sex Ratio; Sweden; Temperature",,,,,,"Guy, W.A., On temperature and its relation to mortality: An illustration of the application of the numerical method to the discovery of truth (1881) J Stat Soc London, 44, pp. 235-268; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
