Box 821, Nanjing 210008, China","Analyses of regional carbon sources and sinks are essential to assess the economical feasibility of various carbon sequestration technologies for mitigating atmospheric CO2 accumulation and for preventing global warming. Such an inventory is a prerequisite for regional trading of CO 2 emissions. As a U.S. Department of Energy Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partner, we have estimated the state-level terrestrial carbon pools in the southeast and south-central US. This region includes: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. We have also projected the potential for terrestrial carbon sequestration in the region. Texas is the largest contributor (34%) to greenhouse gas emission in the region. The total terrestrial carbon storage (forest biomass and soils) in the southeast and south-central US is estimated to be 130 Tg C/year. An annual forest carbon sink (estimated as 76 Tg C/year) could compensate for 13% of the regional total annual greenhouse gas emission (505 Tg C, 1990 estimate). Through proper policies and the best land management practices, 54 Tg C/year could be sequestered in soils. Thus, terrestrial sinks can capture 23% of the regional total greenhouse emission and hence are one of the most cost-effective options for mitigating greenhouse emission in the region. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Climate change; Economic analysis; Inventory control; Carbon pools; Carbon sequestration technologies; Carbon dioxide; atmospheric gas; atmospheric pollution; best management practice; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; global warming; greenhouse gas; land management; mitigation; pollution control; source-sink dynamics; North America; United States",,,,,,"Arnold, J.G., Weltz, M.A., Albertsm, E.E., Flanagan, D.C., Plant growth component (1995) NSERL Report 10, , Flanagan DC, Nearing MA (eds) USDA Water Erosion Prediction Project Hillslope Profile and Watershed Model Document, USDA-ARS National Soil Erosion Research Lab, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907; Batjes, N.H., Total carbon and nitrogen in soils of the world (1996) Eur J Soil Sci, 47, pp. 151-163; Birdsey, R.A., Sampson, R.N., Hair, D., Carbon storage in United States forests (1996) Forest and Global Change, V.
