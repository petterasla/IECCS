Results suggest that global warming causes increased water temperatures and reduced sea ice cover, combined (eventually) with increased winter mean wind speeds and increased river runoff. The projected hydrographic changes could therefore have significant effects on the marine ecosystem. These changes may compete with nutrient load reductions-presently under discussion-that aim to improve the ecological status of the Baltic Sea. Targets that may be sufficient in the present climate might fail under future climate conditions. Using the model, we investigated 4 climate change scenarios and 3 nutrient load scenarios, ranging from a pessimistic 'business as usual' to the 'most optimistic' case (including the Baltic Sea Action Plan, BSAP). In addition, using cause-and-effect studies, we analyzed changing simulated nutrient cycles, oxygen concentrations, and phytoplankton concentrations. As model results for the northern part of the Baltic (Bothnian Bay and Bothnian Sea) are not reliable, we focus the analysis on the Baltic proper, including the Arkona, Bornholm and Gotland basins. The degree of nutrient reduction in nutrient-load reduction scenarios is likely to differ under a future climate, but actions of the BSAP will reduce phytoplankton concentrations also in the future climate. However, the sensitivity of non-linear responses to climate change depends on processes that are not well understood, with current understanding limited by modelling uncertainties (e.g. in the long-term functioning of Baltic Sea sediments as sources and sinks of nutrients). © Inter-Research 2011.","Baltic Sea Action Plan; Climate change; Eutrophication; Marine ecosystems; Numerical modeling; Scenarios","3-dimensional; Action plan; Baltic sea; Business-as-usual; Changing climate; Climate change scenarios; Combined effect; Ecological status; Future climate; High resolution; Hydrographic changes; Marine ecosystem; Marine ecosystems; Mean wind speed; Model results; Non-linear response; Numerical modeling; Nutrient cycle; Nutrient loads; Nutrient reduction; Oxygen concentrations; River runoffs; Scenarios; Sea-ice cover; Sewage water; Water temperatures; Algae control; Analytical geochemistry; Anoxic sediments; Biogeochemistry; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Global warming; Nutrients; Phytoplankton; Sea ice; Seawater; Sewage; Sewage treatment; Water treatment; Climate models; action plan; anthropogenic effect; biogeochemical cycle; climate effect; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem response; emission inventory; environmental disturbance; eutrophication; future prospect; hydrological change; ice cover; land use change; marine ecosystem; numerical model; nutrient dynamics; phytoplankton; runoff; sea ice; sewage treatment; three-dimensional modeling; uncertainty analysis; water temperature; wind velocity; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",,,,,,"Andersson, P., Håkansson, B., Håkansson, J., Sahlsten, E., Havenhand, J., Thorndyke, M., Dupont, S., Marine acidification: On effects and monitoring of marine acidification in the seas surrounding Sweden (2008) SMHI Report Oceanografi Nr.92.
