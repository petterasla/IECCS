This paper is an attempt to answer the following main questions: Does the Protocol signature have any immediate impact on countries behaviour? Is the speed of changes similar to all European countries? Are there any allometric scaling relations between the measure of country’s dynamic (CO2 emission or other environmental parameter) and the country’s size (population or Gross Domestic Product)? In case of differences among European countries, are these scaling relations relevant to explain the differences? This paper examines the differences between 2 time intervals (i.e., 1990-1997 and 1998-2005), regarding CO2 and other environmental indicators in 15 European countries. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","allometric scaling laws; CO2 emissions; consumption of fertilisers; energy consumption; global warming; Kyoto Protocol; recovered paper",,,,,,,"Barenblatt, G.I., Scaling (2003) Cambridge Texts in Applied Mathematics, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bejan, A., (2000) Shape and Structure, from Engineering to Nature, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bejan, A., Lorente, S., (2008) Design with Constructal Theory, , Wiley, New York; Brock, W.A., Scaling in economics: a readers’ guide (1999) Industrial and Corporate Change, 8, pp. 409-446; Brown, J.H., West, G.B., (2000) Scaling in Biology, , Oxford University Press, New York; Dinan, D., (2006) Origins and Evolution of the European Union, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Feroz, E.H., Raab, R.L., Ulleberg, G.T., Alsharif, K., Global warming and environmental production efficiency ranking of the Kyoto Protocol nations (2009) Journal of Environmental Management, 90, pp. 1178-1183; (2005), http://www.fao.org/forestry/foris/webview/forestry2/index.jsp?siteId=101&langId=1, (Accessed on 17 June 2007)(2008) FAOSTAT Online Statistical Service, , http://faostat.fao.org/, (Accessed on 10 April 2009); Freedman, M., Jaggi, B., Global warming, commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, and accounting disclosures by the largest global public firms from polluting industries (2005) The International Journal of Accounting, 40, pp. 215-232; Goren-Inbar, N., Alperson, N., Kislev, M.E., Simchon, O., Melamed, Y., Ben-Nun, A., Werker, E., Evidence of hominin control of fire at Gesher Benot Yáquov, Israel (2004) Science, 304, pp. 725-727; Highfill, J., The economic crisis as of December 2008: the global economy journal weighs in (2008) Global Economy Journal, Berkeley Electronic Press, , http://www.bepress.com/gej/vol8/iss4/4/; Huxley, J.S., (1932) Problems of Relative Growth, , Methuen, London; CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (1971-2004) (2006) Publisher Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2006 (22), p. 557; (2009) CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, p. 530. , IEA Statistics; (2006) International Energy Outlook 2006, , www.eia.doe.gov/iaf/ieo/index.html, (Accessed on 12 January 2008); Marland, G., Boden, T.A., Andres, R.J., Global, regional, and national fossil fuel CO2 emissions (2005) A Compendium of Data on Global Change, , Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, US Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., USA; Meinshausen, M., Meinshausen, N., Hare, W., Raper, S.C.B., Frieler, K., Knutti, R., Frame, D.J., Allen, M.R., Greenhouse-gas emission targets for limiting global warming to 2°C (2009) Nature, 458, pp. 1158-1162; Miguel, A.F., Shape and complexity in living systems (2006) Along with Constructal Theory, pp. 137-162. , Hernandez, J. and Cosinschi, M.
