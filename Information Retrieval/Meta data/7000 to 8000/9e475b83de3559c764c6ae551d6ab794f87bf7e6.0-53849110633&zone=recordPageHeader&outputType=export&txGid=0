The pallid kangaroo mouse, M. pallidus, is a sand-obligate desert rodent. Our principal intent is to identify its current geographical distribution and to formulate a phylogeographical hypothesis for this taxon. In addition, we test for orientation patterns in haplotype sharing for evidence of past episodes of movement and gene flow. Location: The Great Basin Desert region of western North America, especially the sandy habitats of the Lahontan Trough and those in south-central Nevada. Methods: Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from portions of three genes (16S ribosomal RNA, cytochrome b, and transfer RNA for glutamic acid) were obtained from 98 individuals of M. pallidus representing 27 general localities sampled throughout its geographical range. Molecular sequence data were analysed using neighbour-joining, maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic inference. Directional analysis of phylogeographical patterns, a novel method, was used to examine angular measurements of haplotype sharing between pairs of localities to detect and quantify historical events pertaining to movement patterns and gene flow. Results: Collecting activities showed that M. pallidus is a rather rare rodent (mean trapping success was 2.88%), and its distribution has changed little from that determined three-quarters of a century ago. Two principal phylogroups, distributed as eastern and western moieties, are evident from the phylogenetic analyses (mean sequence divergence for cytochrome b is c. 8%). The western clade shows little phylogenetic structure and seems to represent a large polytomy. In the eastern clade, however, three subgroups are recognized. Nine of the 42 unique composite haplotypes are present at two or more localities and are used for the orientation analyses. Axial data from haplotype sharing between pairwise localities show significant, non-random angular patterns: a north-west to south-east orientation in the western clade, and a north-east to south-west directional pattern in the eastern clade. Main conclusions: The geographical range of M. pallidus seems to be remarkably stable in historical times and does not show a northward (or elevationally upward) movement trend, as has been reported for some other kinds of organism in response to global climate change. The eastern and western clades are likely to represent morphologically cryptic species. Estimated times of divergence of the principal clades of M. pallidus (4.38 Ma) and between M. pallidus and M. megacephalus (8.1 Ma; data from a related study) indicate that kangaroo mice diverged much earlier than thought previously. The phylogeographical patterns described here may serve as a model for other sand-obligate members of the Great Basin Desert biota. © 2008 The Authors.","Conservation biogeography; Cryptic species; Directional analysis; Evolutionarily significant units; Great Basin; Historical biogeography; Microdipodops pallidus; Mitochondrial DNA; Pallid kangaroo mouse; Phylogeography","cladistics; climate change; desert; divergence; endemic species; gene flow; geographical distribution; mitochondrial DNA; molecular analysis; morphology; movement; phylogeography; rodent; species conservation; taxonomy; zoogeography; Basin and Range Province; Great Basin; North America; United States; Microdipodops; Microdipodops megacephalus; Microdipodops pallidus; Mus; Rodentia",,,,,,"Alexander, L.F., Riddle, B.R., Phylogenetics of the New World rodent family Heteromyidae (2005) Journal of Mammalogy, 86, pp. 366-379; Baker, R.J., Bradley, R.D., Speciation in mammals and the genetic species concept (2006) Journal of Mammalogy, 87, pp. 643-662; Barker, F.K., Lanyon, S.M., The impact of parsimony weighting schemes on inferred relationships among toucans and Neotropical barbets (Aves: Piciformes) (2000) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 15, pp. 215-234; Batschelet, E., (1981) Circular Statistics in Biology., , Academic Press, New York; Beever, E.A., Brussard, P.F., Berger, J., Patterns of apparent extirpation among isolated populations of pikas (Ochotona princeps) in the Great Basin (2003) Journal of Mammalogy, 84, pp. 37-54; Blois, J.L., Arbogast, B.S., Conservation genetics of the Sonoma tree vole (Arborimus pomo) based on mitochondrial and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers (2006) Journal of Mammalogy, 87, pp. 950-960; Bremer, K., Branch support and tree stability (1994) Cladistics, 10, pp. 295-304; Britten, H.B., Rust, R.W., Population structure of a sand dune-obligate beetle, Eusattus muricatus, and its implications for dune management (1996) Conservation Biology, 10, pp. 647-652; Brown, J.H., Species diversity of seed-eating desert rodents in sand dune habitats (1973) Ecology, 54, pp. 775-787; Carranza, S., Harris, D.J., Arnold, E.N., Batista, V., Gonzalez De La Vega, J.P., Phylogeography of the lacertid lizard, Psammodromus algirus, in Iberia and across the Strait of Gibraltar (2006) Journal of Biogeography, 33, pp. 1279-1288; Cassiliano, M.L., Biostratigraphy of Blancan and Irvingtonian mammals in the Fish Creek-Vallecito Creek section, southern California, and a review of the Blancan-Irvingtonian boundary (1999) Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 19, pp. 169-186; Cronquist, A., Holmgren, A.H., Holmgren, N.H., Reveal, J.L., (1972) Intermountain Flora: Vascular Plants of the Intermountain West, USA, , Vol. 1.
