Research on the impacts and adaptation measures for global warming in Japan is reviewed. One of the most significant impacts of climate change in Japan will exacerbate the existing heat island phenomenon in cities by absorbing increased solar radiation. This will lead to further increases in temperatures in an urban microclimate with negative implications for energy and water consumption, human health and discomfort, and local ecosystems. The current urban heat island phenomenon and its impacts are described. The relationships between climate change and urban heat island impacts are discussed. Potential adaptation measures to those impacts are also discussed and proposed.","Adaptation strategies; Building stock; Climate change; Comfort; Design factors; Heat island; Japan; Risk; Solar absorption; Sustainability; Urban microclimate","Climate change; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Risk management; Solar radiation; Strategic planning; Structural design; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Building stock; Japan; Solar absorption; Urban heat islands; Urban microclimate; Buildings",,,,,,"Arai, Y., Takeda, H., Influence of urban area warming on energy consumption and thermal environment (1995) 25th Symposium on Heat, Architectural Institute of Japan, pp. 93-100. , [in Japanese]; (2001) Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Japan 2001, , Global Warming Impacts Assessment Working Group, Committee for Studying Global Warming Issues, Ministry of the Environment; [in Japanese]; Japan's third national communication under the united nations framework convention on climate change (2002), [http://www.env.go.jp/earth/ondanka/kikouhendou/], Government of JapanHirano, Y., Kaya, Y., Shibasaki, R., Impact assessment of heat island phenomenon on energy consumption for air conditioning, heating and hot water (1999) Proceedings of Japan Society of Civil Engineering, 629, pp. 83-95. , [in Japanese]; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, 3. , IPCC; Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (2001) Report on the Analysis on the Actual Condition of Urban Heat Island Phenomenon and Its Mitigation Measures in FY2000, , Japanese Ministry of Environment; [in Japanese]; (1999) 1999 Energy Handbook for Residential Sector, , Jyukankyo Research Institute; [in Japanese]; (2002) Quality of the Environment in Japan 2002, , Ministry of the Environment; (White Paper on Environment); Nakamura, Y., Trends of human deaths in residences and hospitals in Kyoto in hot and humid summer seasons (1988) Proceedings of the CIB Conference in Healthy Buildings '88, 2, pp. 43-52. , Stockholm; Nakamura, Y., Conception of summertime system for health promotion aiming at obtaining seasonal acclimatisation (2001) Environmental Information Science, pp. 30-34. , [in Japanese]; Niizawa, H., Management of urban heat environment and water resource allocation problems (1985) Energy and Resources [Journal of the Japan Society of Energy and Resources], 6 (2), pp. 74-79. , [in Japanese]; Niwa, K., Study on newly climatic data for thermal load calculation (2002) Technical Papers of the Annual Meeting, Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Sanitary Engineers of Japan, pp. 9-16. , [in Japanese]; Omoto, T., Aono, Y., Estimation of change in blooming dates of cherry flower by urban warming (1990) Journal of Agricultural Meteorology, 46 (3), pp. 123-129. , [in Japanese]; Seino, H., Distribution maps of net primary productivity (NPP) of natural vegetation and related climatic resources (2002), [http://cse.niaes.affrc.go.jp/hseino/G7/clmres_e.html](1992) The Report of the Sub-Committee on Environmental Change.
