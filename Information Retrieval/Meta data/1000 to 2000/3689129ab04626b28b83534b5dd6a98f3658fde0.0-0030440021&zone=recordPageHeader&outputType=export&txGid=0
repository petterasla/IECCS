The June 1991 eruption of the Philippine volcano, Mount Pinatubo, provides an important opportunity to test existing understanding and extend previous empirical analyses of the volcanic effect We identify the spatial climate response to major historic eruptions in the surface air temperature and mean-sea-level pressure record and use this information to assess the impact of the Pinatubo eruption. The Pinatubo eruption clearly generated significant global cooling during the years after the event The magnitude and timing of the cooling is similar to that associated with previous equatorial eruptions. There is good agreement between the spatial patterns of temperature and circulation anomalies associated with the historic eruptions and those following the Mount Pinatubo event. Evidence of limited higher latitude warming and a major change in the atmospheric circulation is found over the Northern Hemisphere during the first winter after the equatorial eruptions analysed, followed by widespread cooling, but limited change in die atmosphere circulation, during the subsequent 2 years.","Climate change; Greenhouse effect; Temperature; Volcanic eruptions","atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate prediction; greenhouse effect; spatial response; volcanic eruption; Philippines, Mount Pinatubo",,,,,,"Bradley, R.S., The explosive volcanic eruption signal in northern hemisphere continental temperature records (1988) Climatic Change, 12, pp. 221-243; Bradley, R.S., Jones, P.D., Records of explosive volcanic eruptions over the last 500 years (1992) Climate since A.D. 1500, pp. 606-622. , Bradley, R.
