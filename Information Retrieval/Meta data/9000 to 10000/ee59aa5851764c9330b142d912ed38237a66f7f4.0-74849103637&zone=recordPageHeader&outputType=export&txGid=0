We use mercury (Hg) and carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios as biomarkers to understand species diet differences and age class differences among ringed (Phoca hispida), bearded (Erignathus barbatus), and harbour (P. vitulina) seals in a subarctic marine ecosystem. Adult bearded seals had significantly lower δ15N and muscle Hg than bearded seal pups, whereas the opposite was observed in ringed seals where pups had lower δ15N than adults, suggesting age specific foraging differences in trophic food level for both species. For harbour seals, δ15N did not differ significantly among ages while Hg and δ13C did. The δ13C in muscle supports that bearded seals in this study are benthic feeders and are part of a separate food web from ringed seals and harbour seals. Harbour seals had the highest levels of mercury and δ15N, indicating they feed at a higher trophic level relative to the other two seal species. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios and Hg levels illustrate how resources are partitioned among three seal species and offer evidence for separation based on life stages within species. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Age differences; Competition; Food web; Global warming; Hudson Bay; Marine ecosystem; Pinnipeds","age class; benthic environment; biomarker; carbon isotope; carnivore; climate effect; feeding behavior; food web; global warming; inorganic compound; interspecific competition; marine ecosystem; mercury (element); pinniped; population distribution; species diversity; stable isotope; Canada; Hudson Bay; Erignathus; Erignathus barbatus; Phoca; Phoca hispida; Phoca vitulina; Pinnipedia",,,,,,"Arctic pollution 2002: Persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, radioactivity, human health, changing pathways (2002) Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), , AMAP, Oslo; Armstrong, J.A.J., Uthe, J.F., Semi-automated determination of mercury in animal tissue (1971) At Absorpt Newsl, 10, pp. 101-103; Atwell, L., Hobson, K.A., Welch, H.E., Biomagnification and bioaccumulation of mercury in an arctic marine food web: Insights from stable nitrogen isotope analysis (1998) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 55, pp. 1114-1121; Benjaminsen, T., Age determination and the growth and age distribution from cementum growth layers of bearded seals at Svalbard (1973) Fisk Dir Skr Ser Hav Unders, 16, pp. 159-170; Bradstreet, M.S.W., Cross, W.E., Trophic relationships at high Arctic ice edges (1982) Arctic, 35, pp. 1-12; Cabana, G., Rasmussen, J.B., Modelling food chain structure and contaminant bioaccumulation using stable nitrogen isotopes (1994) Nature, 372, pp. 255-257; Campbell, L.M., Norstrom, R.J., Hobson, K.A., Muir, D.C.G., Backus, S., Fisk, A.T., Mercury and other trace elements in a pelagic Arctic marine food web (Northwater Polynya, Baffin Bay) (2005) Sci Total Environ, 351-352, pp. 247-263; Chambellant, M., Ferguson, S.H., Ageing live ringed seals (Phoca hispida): Which tooth to pull?
