The product of these indices, the environmental productivity index (EPI), was used to predict the productivity of O. ficus-indica under current climatic conditions and under those accompanying a possible increase in the atmospheric CO2 level to 650μmol mol-1. Sites with temperatures always above -10°C and hence suitable for prickly-pear cultivation numbered 37 in the USA and 110 worldwide; such sites increased by 43 and 5%, respectively, for the global warming accompanying the elevated CO2. Productivity of O. ficus-indica was at least 15 tonnes dry weight hectare-1 yr-1, for 20 sites with temperatures always above -10°C in the USA and for 12 such sites worldwide under current climatic conditions; such sites increased by 85 and 117%, respectively, under elevated CO2 condition, mainly because of direct effects of the atmospheric CO2 level on net CO2 uptake. -from Author",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; photosynthetic photon flux density; prickly pear; temperature; water use; USA; Opuntia ficus-indica",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026339586
