We will focus on the risks and dangers involved in using this kind of large-scale engineering approach, which is not yet fully tested, to combat global warming. We will not provide a complete discussion on the technologies involved, but concentrate on a few principal questions, such as the responsibility of environmental scientists involved in this research. We will also discuss carbon sequestration in relation to the precautionary approach. We argue that there may be a place for large-scale engineering attempts, but this should be the last rather than the first option. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Carbon sequestration; Precautionary approach; Responsibility of scientists","Air pollution control; Aquifers; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Waste disposal; Carbon sequestration; Large-scale engineering; Precautionary approach; Carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; precautionary principle; carbon sequestration; deep sea; engineering; environmental protection; geology; greenhouse effect; responsibility; review; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Engineering; Environment; Geology; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Oceans and Seas; Research Personnel; Risk Assessment; Science; Social Responsibility; Uncertainty",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Barker, S., Elderfield, H., Foraminiferal Calcification response to glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric CO2 (2002) Science, 297, pp. 833-836; Barry, J., Seibel, B.A., Drazen, J., Tamburri, M., Lovera, C., Brewer, P., Field experiments on direct ocean CO2 sequestration: The response of deep-sea faunal assemblages to CO2 injection at 3200 m off Central California (2002) Eos Trans.
