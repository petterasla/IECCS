For example, the distribution of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has expanded into new regions. We surveyed the levels of hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies against JEV (Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) in wild birds captured in Korea. Blood samples were collected from 1,316 wild birds including the following migratory birds: Oceanodroma castro (n = 4), Anas formosa (n = 7), Anas penelope (n = 20), Fulica atra (n = 30), Anas acuta (n = 89), Anas crecca (n = 154), Anas platyrhynchos (n = 214), Aix galericulata (n = 310), and Anas poecilorhyncha (n = 488). All were captured in 16 locations in several Korea provinces between April 2007 and December 2009. Out of the 1,316 serum samples tested, 1,141 (86.7%) were positive for JEV. Wild birds captured in 2009 had a higher seroprevalence of ant-JEV antibodies than those captured in 2007. Wild birds with an HI antibody titer of 1: 1,280 or higher accounted for 21.2% (280/1,316) of the animals tested. These findings indicated that wild birds from the region examined in our study have been exposed to JEV and may pose a high risk for introducing a new JEV genotype into Korea.","Japanese encephalitis virus; Serosurveillance; Wild bird","animal; animal disease; article; bird; bird disease; blood; epidemiology; genetics; genotype; health survey; hemagglutination inhibition test; isolation and purification; Japanese encephalitis; Japanese encephalitis virus; population migration; South Korea; virology; wild animal; Animal Migration; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bird Diseases; Birds; Encephalitis Virus, Japanese; Encephalitis, Japanese; Genotype; Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests; Population Surveillance; Republic of Korea; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Aix galericulata; Anas acuta; Anas crecca; Anas formosa; Anas penelope; Anas platyrhynchos; Anas poecilorhyncha; Animalia; Aves; Flaviviridae; Flavivirus; Fulica atra; Japanese encephalitis virus; Oceanodroma castro",,,,,,"Chen, W.R., Tesh, R.B., Rico-Hesse, R., Genetic variation of Japanese encephalitis virus in nature (1990) J Gen Virol, 71 (PART 12), pp. 2915-2922; Clarke, D.H., Casals, J., Techniques for hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition with arthropod-borne viruses (1958) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 7, pp. 561-573; Dhanda, V., Banerjee, K., Deshmukh, P.K., Ilkal, M.A., Experimental viraemia and transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus by mosquitoes in domestic ducks (1977) Indian J Med Res, 66, pp. 881-888; Goverdhan, M.K., Kulkarni, A.B., Gupta, A.K., Tupe, C.D., Rodrigues, J.J., Two-way cross-protection between West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses in bonnet macaques (1992) Acta Virol, 36, pp. 277-283; Griffin, D.E., Emergence and re-emergence of viral diseases of the central nervous system (2010) Prog Neurobiol, 91, pp. 95-101; Hirota, J., Nishi, H., Matsuda, H., Tsunemitsu, H., Shimiz, S., Cross-reactivity of Japanese encephalitis virus-vaccinated horse sera in serodiagnosis of West Nile virus (2010) J Vet Med Sci, 72, pp. 369-372; Huong, V.T.Q., Ha, D.Q., Deubel, V., Genetic study of Japanese encephalitis viruses from Vietnam (1993) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 49, pp. 538-544; Konishi, E., Shoda, M., Ajiro, N., Kondo, T., Development and evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for quantifying antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus nonstructural 1 protein to detect subclinical infections in vaccinated horses (2004) J Clin Microbiol, 42, pp. 5087-5093; Kwon, H.J., Jang, B.J., Lim, Y.M., Lee, C.K., Jeon, Y.S., Studies on Japanese encephalitis live vaccine.
