The system was constructed with a surface area of 0.986 m2 and equipped with paddle wheels (8 fins). The semicontinuous batch culture experiment was carried out for 4 months from June to October 1998 in Sendai city. The productivity of Chlorophyta sp. was ranged from 4 to 13 g·m-2·d-1 and the average was 8.2 g·m-2.d-1, which corresponded to the photosynthetic efficiency of 4.15% (PAR). The productivity of Chlorella sp. was ranged from 7 to 21 g. m-2·d-1 and the average was 13.2 g·m-2·d-1, which corresponded to the photosynthetic efficiency of 6.56% (PAR). These results indicate that stable microalgal cultivation with comparatively high photosynthetic efficiency could be obtained in a raceway system under greenhouse conditions in Sendai city located in the northern part of Japan.","CO2; Global warming; Microalgae; Photosynthesis; Raceway","alga; article; biomass; greenhouse effect; Japan; nonhuman; photosynthesis; Chlorella",,,,,,"Benemann, J.R., Tillett, D.M., Weissman, J.C., (1986) Microalgae Biotechnology TIBTECH., 5, pp. 47-53; Hall, D.O., Scurlock, J.M.O., Biomass production and data (1993) Photosynthesis and Production in a Changing Environment, pp. 425-444. , Hall, D.
