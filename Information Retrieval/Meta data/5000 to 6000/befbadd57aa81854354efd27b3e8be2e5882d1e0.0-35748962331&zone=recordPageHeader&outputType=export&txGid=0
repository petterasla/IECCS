As a result of regulations intended to reduce human exposure, crop contamination with aflatoxins causes significant economic loss for producers, marketers, and processors of diverse susceptible crops. Aflatoxin contamination occurs when specific fungi in the genus Aspergillus infect crops. Many industries frequently affected by aflatoxin contamination know from experience and anecdote that fluctuations in climate impact the extent of contamination. Climate influences contamination, in part, by direct effects on the causative fungi. As climate shifts, so do the complex communities of aflatoxin-producing fungi. This includes changes in the quantity of aflatoxin-producers in the environment and alterations to fungal community structure. Fluctuations in climate also influence predisposition of hosts to contamination by altering crop development and by affecting insects that create wounds on which aflatoxin-producers proliferate. Aflatoxin contamination is prevalent both in warm humid climates and in irrigated hot deserts. In temperate regions, contamination may be severe during drought. The contamination process is frequently broken down into two phases with the first phase occurring on the developing crop and the second phase affecting the crop after maturation. Rain and temperature influence the phases differently with dry, hot conditions favoring the first and warm, wet conditions favoring the second. Contamination varies with climate both temporally and spatially. Geostatistics and multiple regression analyses have shed light on influences of weather on contamination. Geostatistical analyses have been used to identify recurrent contamination patterns and to match these with environmental variables. In the process environmental conditions with the greatest impact on contamination are identified. Likewise, multiple regression analyses allow ranking of environmental variables based on relative influence on contamination. Understanding the impact of climate may allow development of improved management procedures, better allocation of monitoring efforts, and adjustment of agronomic practices in anticipation of global climate change.","Aflatoxins; Aspergillus flavus; Causative fungi; Mycotoxins","aflatoxin; mycotoxin; rain; article; Aspergillus; climate change; community structure; crop; desert; drought; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; food contamination; fungus; humidity; irrigation (agriculture); multiple regression; nonhuman; prevalence; weather; Acclimatization; Aflatoxins; Aspergillus flavus; Biomass; Cereals; Climate; Ecosystem; Food Contamination; Population Dynamics; Prevalence; Rain; Temperature; Aspergillus; Aspergillus flavus; Fungi; Hexapoda",,"aflatoxin, 1402-68-2; Aflatoxins",,,,"Ashworth, L.J., McMeans, J.L., Brown, C.M., Infection of cotton by Aspergillus flavus: epidemiology of the disease (1969) Journal of Stored Products Research, 5, pp. 193-202; Bayman, P., Cotty, P.J., Vegetative compatibility and genetic diversity in the Aspergillus flavus population of single field (1991) Canadian Journal of Botany-Revue Canadienne De Botanique, 69, pp. 1707-1711; Bayman, P., Cotty, P.J., Genetic diversity in Aspergillus flavus - association with aflatoxin production and morphology (1993) Canadian Journal of Botany-Revue Canadienne De Botanique, 71, pp. 23-31; Berberich, S., Is cotton containing the bollguard gene safe?
