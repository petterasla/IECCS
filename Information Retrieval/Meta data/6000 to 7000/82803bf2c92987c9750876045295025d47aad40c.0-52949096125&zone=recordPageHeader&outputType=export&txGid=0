Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes environmental sensing strategies and technologies for air, water quality and other monitoring applications. It concludes with a brief overview of research. Findings - As a consequence of legislation, a technologically diverse family of sensors are used in a wide range of portable and fixed instruments to determine numerous polluting compounds entering and present in the environment. These play a critical role in protecting the environment, maintaining public health and monitoring global phenomena such as ozone depletion and artificial global warming. There is a widespread and technologically diverse research effort. Originality/value - This paper provides a detailed insight into the sensors and instruments used in environmental monitoring. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Air; Environmental management; Legislation; Pollution; Sensors; Water","Air pollution; Arsenic compounds; Chlorine compounds; Environmental engineering; Environmental protection; Global warming; Ozone; Ozone layer; Sensors; Technology; Water quality; Air; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental management; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental sensing; Legislation; Monitoring applications; OF sensors; Ozone depletion; Pollution; Public health; Water; Research",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,02602288,,SNRVD,,"English","Sens.
