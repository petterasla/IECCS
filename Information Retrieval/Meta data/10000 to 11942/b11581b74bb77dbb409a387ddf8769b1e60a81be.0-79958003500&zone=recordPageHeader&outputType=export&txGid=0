This work presents a technique for and results of such an analysis and quantifies the errors that can be encountered when these variations are not appropriately addressed. The study consists of an hour-by-hour analysis of the energy used by four different variations of a five-story condominium building, with a gross floor area of approximately 9,290 square meters (m2), planned for construction in Markham, Ontario, Canada. The results of the case studied indicate that failure to account for variation can, for example, cause a 4% error in the carbon footprint of a building where ground source heat pumps are used and a 6% and 8% error in accounting for the carbon savings of wind and photovoltaic systems, respectively. After the building envelope was enhanced and sources of alternative energy were incorporated, the embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were more than 50% of the building's operational emissions. This work illustrates the importance of short-time-scale GHG analysis for buildings. © 2011 by Yale University.","Carbon accounting; Green buildings; Greenhouse gas emissions; Industrial ecology; Low-carbon building design; Low-energy residence","Carbon accounting; Green buildings; Industrial ecology; Low energies; Low-carbon; Apartment houses; Buildings; Geothermal heat pumps; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Photovoltaic effects; Gas emissions; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; architectural design; atmospheric pollution; emission; energy efficiency; error analysis; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; photovoltaic system; wind power; Canada; Markham; Ontario [Canada]",,,,,,"Allen, S.R., Hammond, G.P., McManus, M.C., Energy analysis and environmental life cycle assessment of a micro-wind turbine (2008) Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part A: Journal of Power and Energy, 222 (7), pp. 669-684; (2010), Athena Institute.The Athena Institute: Impact estimator for buildings.Accessed July 2010Athinetis, A., (2008), Design of advanced solar homes aimed at net-zero annual energy consumption in Canada.
