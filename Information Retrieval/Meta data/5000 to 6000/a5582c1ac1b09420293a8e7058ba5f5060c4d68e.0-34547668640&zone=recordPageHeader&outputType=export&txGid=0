For this purpose, the amount of photons absorbed has been related to electrons transported by photosystem II, to gas exchange rates, and to the newly formed biomass differentially resolved into carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids measured by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Under high nutrient conditions, the quantum efficiency of carbon-related biomass production (ΦC) and the metabolic costs of carbon (C) production were found to be strongly controlled by the light climate. Under N-limited conditions, the light climate was less important for the efficieny of primary production. Thus, the largest range of ΦC dependent on the nutrient status of the cells was observed under non-fluctuating light conditions which are comparable with stratified conditions in the natural environment. It is evident that N limitation induced pronounced changes in the composition of macromolecular compounds and, thus, influenced the degree of reduction of the biomass as well as the metabolic costs of C production. However, ΦC and the metabolic costs are not predictable from the photosynthesis rates. In consequence, the results clearly show that bio-optical methods as well as gas exchange measurements during the light phase can severely mismatch the true energy storage in the biomass especially under high nutrient in combination with non-fluctuating light conditions. © The Author [2007].
