Taking into consideration their ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP) there is wide acceptance that HCFC-123 and 141b are the nearest 'drop in' substitutes known today for CFC-11 replacement. However, this has major implications as these new blowing agents are significantly more aggressive requiring novel approaches in terms of material choice for monolithic and/or co-extruded sheet to retain the optimum sheet thickness, productivity and economics of current materials. This paper first of all summarises the current status of developments towards the reduction and eventual elimination of CFC-11 from rigid polyurethane foam systems used for the insulation of domestic refrigerators and freezers. It then addresses the problems of liner/alternative blowing agent interactions using tests which attempt to bridge the classical laboratory tests whilst acknowledging the ultimate need to run full scale processing, assembly and functional performance trials at refrigerator manufacturers. Key-parameters covered include thermal conductivity, its aging, carbon dioxide permeability and adhesion between the polyurethane foam and the plastic liner. Physical attack of the liners is studied employing two qualitative tests. One involves an unconstrained situation with profiled vacuum formed liner in contact with HCFC blown foams; the other, the use of a prototype tool which incorporates shelf support and mullion in a restrained mode with an aluminum tool. New liner materials and combinations which are compatible with HCFC blown foams are identified as a result of this work.",,"Domestic appliances; Materials testing; Organic compounds; Plastic products; Plastics applications; Polyurethanes; Refrigerators; Rigid foamed plastics; Hydrochlorofluorocarbons; Oxygen permeability; Polyurethane foams; Profiled vacuum formed liner; Prototype tool testing; Refrigerator liner materials; Vapor uptake; Thermal insulating materials",,,,,,,"Potter, K.G.; Monsanto Europe S.A., Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium",,"SPI;European Isocyanate Producers Assoc","Publ by Technomic Publ Co Inc, Lancaster, PA, United States","Polyurethanes World Congress 1991","24 September 1991 through 26 September 1991","Nice, Fr",17401,,,,,"English",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026393938
