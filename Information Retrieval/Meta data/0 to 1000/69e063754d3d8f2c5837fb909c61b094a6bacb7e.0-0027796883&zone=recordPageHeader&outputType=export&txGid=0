The forest fire business is likely to be affected both early and dramatically by any trend toward warmer and drier conditions in Canada, and fire managers should be aware that the future will likely require new and innovative thinking in forest fire management. This paper summarizes research activities currently underway to assess the impact of global warming on forest fires, and speculates on future fire management problems and strategies. -from Author",,"fire management; forest fire; future strategy; global warming; Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027796883
