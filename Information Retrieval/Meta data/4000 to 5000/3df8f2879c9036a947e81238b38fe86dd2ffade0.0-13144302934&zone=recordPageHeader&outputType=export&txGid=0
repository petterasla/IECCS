As a result of the change of climatic factors, such regional problems are emphasized by falling of underground water level, decrease of water supply and drying of the upper soil layer. The aim of the study is to detect 20th century variations of the soil moisture content in East-Hungary with statistical analysis of objective time series based on meteorological data. Furthermore, by determining representatively long dry and wet periods, management of agro-ecological problems related to the soil moisture content are supported. Palmer drought severity index time series of five meteorological stations in East-Hungary are analysed in the paper for the growing season between 1901 and 1999. Significant fluctuations of the soil moisture content were detected in the region for the 20th century; moreover, the soil became drier in the recent decades. With the help of the ""break-point analysis"" decade-long dry and wet periods were defined for the aim of climatic research. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
