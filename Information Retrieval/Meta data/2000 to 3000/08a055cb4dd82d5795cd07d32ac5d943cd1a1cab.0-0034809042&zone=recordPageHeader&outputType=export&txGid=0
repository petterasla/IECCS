In this study the environmental impacts associated with the returnable and the non-returnable glass beer bottles were assessed in order to compare different reuse percentages. The inventory analysis is performed with data obtained from two Portuguese companies (a glass bottles producer and a brewery) and completed with the BUWAL database. It includes all operations associated with the bottles' manufacture, the brewery and the wastewater treatment plant. The environmental impact assessment considers both the potential ecological and ecotoxicological effects of the emissions. The environmental impact categories included and discussed in this study are the contribution to ecological and human health, global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication and photochemical ozone creation. The first category is divided into three subcategories that are human toxicity, critical air volume and critical water volume. This study was performed for several reuse percentages and returnable bottle cycles, and is comprised of a sensitivity analysis. The general output is that the relative importance of the impacts associated with the use of returnable and/or non-returnable bottles depends on the number of cycles performed by the returnable bottles. According to the impact index defined in this study, the most significant impacts are the eutrophication and the final solid wastes generated, and the least significant impact is the ozone depletion.","Environmental impacts; Glass bottles; Impact index; LCA; Life cycle assessment; Recycling; Reuse","acidification; article; beer; data base; ecology; ecotoxicology; environmental health; environmental monitoring; inventory control; life cycle; photochemistry; priority journal; recycling; solid waste management",,,,,,"Baumann, H., Ekvall, T., Ryderberg, T., Svensson, G., Tillman, A.M., Operationalization of the classification SETAC-Europe Workshop on Environmental Life Cycle Analysis of Products, , SETAC-Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands; (1991) Life Cycle Inventories for Packagings, 123. , Swiss Federal Office of Environment, Forests and Landscape, Zurich, Switzerland; (1998) Life Cycle Inventories for Packagings, 1-2 (250). , Swiss Federal Office of Environment, Forests and Landscape, Zurich, Switzerland; Christiansen, K., Possibilities and limitations to life cycle analysis (1991) Packaging and the Environment - Policies, Strategies and Instruments, , International Expert Seminar, Trolleholm Castle, Sweden, Dept. of Industrial Environmental Economics, Lunds University, Lund, Sweden; (1992) Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Products - Guide and Backgrounds, , Centrum voor Milieukunde, Leiden, The Netherlands; Consoli, F., Allen, D., Bousted, I., Fava, J., Franklin, W., (1993) Guidelines for Life-Cycle Assessment: A Code of Practice, , SETAC, Brussels, Belgium; Derwent, R.G., Jenkin, M.E., (1990) Hydrocarbon involvement in photochemical ozone formation in Europe, , AERE R 13736, Harwell Laboratory, Oxfordshire; Eckenfelder W.W., Jr., (1989) Industrial Water Pollution Control, , McGraw-Hill International Editions, Civil Engineering Series; EC/62/1994: Council Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste(1984) Ökobilanzen von packstoffen, , Schriftenreihe Umweltschutz 24, Herausgegeben vom Bundesamt für Umweltshutz (BUS), Bern; Finnveden, G., (1992) Landfilling - A forgotten Part of the Life Cycle Assessment, , IVL - Swedish Environmental Research Institute, Gothenburg, Sweden; Franklin, W.E., (1990) Comparative Energy and Environmental Analysis of Three Interior Packaging Materials, p. 58. , Franklin Associates, Ltd, Kansas; (1978) Family-Size Soft Drink Container - A comparative Energy and Environmental Impact Analysis, , Prepared for Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Akron, OH; (1989) Comparative Energy and Environmental Impacts for the Delivery of Soft Drinks in Nine Containers, , Prepared for National Association for Plastic Container Recovery (Charlotte, NC), Prairie Village, KS; Guinée, J.B., Headings for classification (1991) SETAC-Europe Workshop on Environmental Life Cycle Analysis of Products, , SETAC-Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands; Guinée, J.B., Heijjungs, R., Huppes, G., Assies, J.A., Huele, R., Van Oers, L., (1991) Manual for the environmental Life Cycle Analysis of Products, , Outline, CES, Leiden University, The Netherlands.
