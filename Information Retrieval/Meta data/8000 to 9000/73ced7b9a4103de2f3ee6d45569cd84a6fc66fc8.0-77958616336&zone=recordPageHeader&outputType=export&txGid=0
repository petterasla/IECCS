Probabilistic estimates of the climatic consequences for a set of resulting multi-gas scenarios over the 21st century are calculated with a reduced complexity climate model, yielding global temperature increase and atmospheric CO2 and CO2-equivalent concentrations. Provisions for banked surplus emission allowances and credits from land use, land-use change and forestry are assessed and are shown to have the potential to lead to significant deterioration of the ambition levels implied by the pledges in 2020. This analysis demonstrates that the Copenhagen Accord and the pledges made under it represent a set of dissonant ambitions. The ambition level of the current pledges for 2020 and the lack of commonly agreed goals for 2050 place in peril the Accord's own ambition: to limit global warming to below 2 °C, and even more so or 1.5 °C, which is referenced in the Accord in association with potentially strengthening the long-term temperature goal in 2015. Due to the limited level of ambition by 2020, the ability to limit emissions afterwards to pathways consistent with either the 2 or 1 .5 °C goal is likely to become less feasible. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Climate negotiations; Copenhagen Accord; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions","Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Climate negotiations; Copenhagen accords; Emission allowances; Equivalent concentrations; Global temperatures; Probabilistic estimates; Reduced complexity; Significant deteriorations; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Boden, T.A., Marland, G., Andres, R.J., (2009) Global Regional and National Fossil-fuel CO2 Emissions, , Oak Ridge, TN; Bowen, A., Ranger, N., (2009) Mitigating Climate Change Through Reductions in Greenhouse Gas Emissions the Science and Economics of Future Paths for Global Annual Emissions, , London: Grantham Research Institute for Climate Change and the Environment; Brohan, P., Kennedy, J.J., Harris, I., Sfb, T., Jones, P.D., Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: A new data set from 1850 (2006) J.
