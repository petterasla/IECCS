The Montreal Protocol to Protect Stratospheric Ozone Layer and recent revisions to the protocol require a rapid phase-out of the production and use of CFCs and a transition to alternative materials and technologies. It is important that the alternative technologies selected do not exacerbate the global warming problem while attempting to preserve stratospheric ozone. A study was conducted to evaluate the total global warming impact of proposed alternatives to SFCs and this paper focuses on the aspects of that study relevant to refrigeration and air-conditiong. The concept of total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) is developed as a measure of the combined global warming impacts of the refrigirant losses to the atmosphere and the CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to generate power to run the refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Equipment using alternatives to CFCs has lower TEWIs than current systems in almost all cases, with dramatic reductions possible in some applications. © 1993.","greenhouse effect; measurement; substitute",,,,,,,"Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) World Meteorological Organization/United Nations Environment Programme Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. xx. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England; Ramanathan, The greenhouse theory of climate change: a test by an inadvertent global experiment (1988) Science, 240, pp. 293-299; Fisher, Hales, Wang, Ko, Sze, Model calculations of the relative effects of CFCs and their replacements on global warming (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 513-516; Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) World Meteorological Organization/United Nations Environment Programme Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. 58. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England; Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) World Meteorological Organization/United National Environment Programme Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. 58. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England; Fischer, S.
