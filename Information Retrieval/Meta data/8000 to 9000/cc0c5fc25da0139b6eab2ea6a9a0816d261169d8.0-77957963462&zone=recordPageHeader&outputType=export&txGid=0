Energy recovery in the form of biogas from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in three different locations is studied. The present status of the biomethanation plants at these locations is reviewed and analysed, in order to understand the prospects of biomethanation as a technological option for managing the increasing urban solid waste sustainability. In spite of the fact that biomethanation is an established technology worldwide, including India, the scale-up of the same has become an uphill task, both for the Central Government and the Urban Local Bodies. Biomethanation for processing the organic fraction of urban solid wastes needs a lot of planning, not only with respect to the design, construction and operation, but also with institutionalising the concept of integrated solid waste management, without which biomethanation would not be a viable option.
