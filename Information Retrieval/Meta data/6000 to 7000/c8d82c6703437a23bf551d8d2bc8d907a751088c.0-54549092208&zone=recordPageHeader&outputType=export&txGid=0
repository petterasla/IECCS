Currently, alpine areas in Australia are largely free of exotic plant species but face increasing pressure from invasive species due to global warming and intensified human use. To predict the potential spread of highly invasive orange hawkweed (Hierachim aurantiacum) from existing founder populations on the Bogong High Plains in southern Australia, we developed an expert-based, spatially explicit, dispersal-constrained, habitat suitability model. The model combines a habitat suitability index, developed from disturbance, site wetness, and vegetation community parameters, with a phenomenological dispersal kernel that uses wind direction and observed dispersal distances. After generating risk maps that defined the relative suitability of H. aurantiacum establishment across the study area, we intensively searched several locations to evaluate the model. The highest relative suitability for H. aurantiacum establishment was southeast from the initial infestations. Native tussock grasslands and disturbed areas had high suitability for H. aurantiacum establishment. Extensive field searches failed to detect new populations. Time-step evaluation using the location of populations known in 1998-2000, accurately assigned high relative suitability for locations where H. aurantiacum had established post-2003 (AUC [area under curve] = 0.855 ± 0.035). This suggests our model has good predictive power and will improve the ability to detect populations and prioritize areas for ongoing monitoring. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Australia; Dispersal; Habitat suitability index; Hieracium aurantiacum; Orange hawkweed; Plant invasion; Risk assessment; Spatial model; Species distribution","alpine environment; biological invasion; dispersal; grassland; habitat quality; herb; invasive species; prediction; risk assessment; vegetation dynamics; Australasia; Australia; Hieracium aurantiacum; article; Asteraceae; Australia; biological model; ecosystem; environmental protection; physiology; population dynamics; time; Asteraceae; Australia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",,,,,,"Baret, S., Rouget, M., Richardson, D.M., Lavergne, C., Egoh, B., Dupont, J., Strasburg, D., Current distribution and potential extent of the most invasive alien plant species on La Reunion (Indian Ocean, Mascarene Islands) (2006) Austral Ecology, 31, pp. 747-758; Bear, R., Hill, W., Pickering, C.M., Distribution and diversity of exotic plant species in montane to alpine areas of Kosciuszko National Park (2006) Cunninghamia, 9, pp. 559-570; Bourg, N.A., McShea, W.J., Gill, D.E., Putting a cart before the search: Successful habitat prediction for a rare forest herb (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2793-2804; Bradley, B.A., Mustard, J.F., Characterizing the landscape dynamics of an invasive plant and risk of invasion using remote sensing (2006) Ecological Applications, 16, pp. 1132-1147; Bridle, K.L., Kirkpatrick, J.B., Cullen, P., Shepherd, R.R., Recovery in alpine heath and grassland following burning and grazing, Eastern Central Plateau, Tasmania, Australia (2001) Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, 33, pp. 348-356; Brinkley, T., Bomford, M., (2002) Agricultural sleeper weeds in Australia: What is the potential threat, , Bureau of Rural Sciences, Canberra, Australia; Buckley, Y.M., Brockerhoff, E., Langer, L., Ledgard, N., North, H., Rees, M., Slowing down a pine invasion despite uncertainty in demography and dispersal (2005) Journal of Applied Ecology, 42, pp. 1020-1030; Bullock, J.M., Clarke, R.T., Long distance seed dispersal by wind: Measuring and modelling the tail of the curve (2000) Oecologia, 124, pp. 506-521; Cheal, D., Bogong High Plains after the 2003 fires (2003) Victorian Naturalist, 120, pp. 201-203; Costin, A.B., (1957) High mountain catchments in Victoria in relation to land use, , Soil Conservation Authority, Victoria, Australia; Dickens, S.J.M., Gerhardt, F., Collinge, S.K., Recreational portage trails as corridors facilitating non-native plant invasions of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (USA) (2005) Conservation Biology, 19, pp. 1653-1657; Duncan, R., Colhoun, K., Foran, B., The distribution and abundance of Hieraciam species (hawkweeds) in the dry grasslands of Canterbury and Otago (1997) New Zealand Journal of Ecology, 21, pp. 51-62; Elith, J., Burgman, M.A., Habitat models for population viability analysis (2003) Population viability-analysis in plants, pp. 203-238. , C.
