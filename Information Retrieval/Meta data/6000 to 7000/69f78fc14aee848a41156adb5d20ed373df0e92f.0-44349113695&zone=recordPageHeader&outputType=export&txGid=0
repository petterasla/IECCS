Four permanent transects of 60 m long are sampled twice a year during the dry and the wet season in the area. Benthic community cover and fish assemblages are assessed using scuba diving techniques. The benthic communities composition remained stable, while already degraded, until end 2005 with average coral cover values of 38.7 % over the Southern reef sites and 22.9 % on the Atlantic coast. The major bleaching event during the second semester of the year 2005 killed about 14 % of the coral colonies in Martinique. Beginning 2006, a disease outbreak also killed another 15 % of the corals, with significant differences between species. Globally, although coral reef decline had started before these events, an average of 30 % of the coral reefs of Martinique disappeared during the past 2 years. Thereby, there was a decrease in the average coral cover down to 32.9 % (South Caribbean) and 14.8 % (Atlantic). No effect has been recorded yet on coral reef fish assemblages in terms of total biodiversity, individuals and biomass. Global climate change and anthropogenic pressures are principally involved in the coral reef ecological status in Martinique. Regional MPAs projects are under review and could be an environmental issue for coral reef protection and preservation in the future.",,"anthropogenic effect; benthos; biological survey; bleaching; community composition; coral; coral reef; environmental monitoring; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Lesser Antilles; Martinique; Windward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Anthozoa",,,,,,,"Legrand, H.; Observatoire du Milieu Marin Martiniquais, 3 avenue Condorcet, F-97200 Fort de France, France; email: ommm@ommm.org",,,,,,,,02497395,,RETVE,,"French","Rev.
