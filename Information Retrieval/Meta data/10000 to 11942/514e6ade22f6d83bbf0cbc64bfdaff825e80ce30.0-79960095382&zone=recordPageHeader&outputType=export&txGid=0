The Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens)-Seiridium spp. pathosystem represents an important case study. In the last century, epidemics of cypress canker have killed historical plantations and the decades-long host resistance will probably break down in the future as a result of both host and pathogen adaptation to increasing temperature and decreasing summer precipitation. In this study, the effect of osmotic water stress on mycelial growth of Seiridium cardinale, S. unicorne and S. cupressi in culture was examined and compared to that of Diplodia cupressi, which is a pathogen of cypress known to be favoured by host water stress. Growth responses were evaluated on potato sucrose agar amended with KCl or NaCl to give water potentials in the range of -0.34 to -15 MPa. Mycelial growth decreased with decreasing water potential and ceased at -15 MPa, although the mycelium remained alive. Histochemical analysis conducted on S. cardinale grown at -12 MPa revealed melanization and thickening of hyphal walls, in addition to abundance of lipid-rich organelles. These results suggest that the three Seiridium spp. might survive drying cycles in cypress wood, but their tolerance is different. Successful survival strategies may partly result from changes in mycelium structure. Furthermore, S. unicorne was positively stimulated by a water potential of -3 MPa, suggesting that it may have high adaptive potential for life in a drier Mediterranean ecosystem, which is predicted to occur under scenarios of global warming.","Cypress canker; Drought stress; Mediterranean region; Mycelium survival","Cupressus; Cupressus sempervirens; Diplodia; Fungi; Seiridium; Seiridium cardinale; Seiridium cupressi; Seiridium unicorne; Solanum tuberosum",,,,,,"Angelopoulos, A., Kapsanaki-Gotsi, E., Korakaki, E., Tsopelas, P., The effect of water stress on the susceptibility of cypress plants to the fungal pathogens Seiridium cardinale, Diplodia cupressi and Pestalotiopsis funerea (2009) Abstracts, 14th Hellenic Phytopathological Congress, , October 7-10, 2008, Dalamanara Argolidas, Greece; Baker, R.H.A., Sansford, C.E., Jarvis, C.H., Cannon, R.J.C., Macleod, A., Walters, K.F.A., The role of climatic mapping in predicting the potential geographic distribution of non-indigenous pests under current and future climates (2000) Agriculture Ecosystem & Environment, 82, pp. 57-71; Bell, A.A., Wheeler, M.H., Biosynthesis and functions of fungal melanins (1986) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 24, pp. 411-451; Butchart, S.M., Walpole, M., Collen, B., Van Strien, A., Scharlemann, J.P.W., Global biodiversity: indicators of recent decline (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1164-1168; Butler, M.J., Day, A.W., Henson, J.M., Money, N., Pathogenic properties of fungal melanins (2001) Mycologia, 93, pp. 1-8; Desprez-Loustau, M.L., Robin, C., Reynaud, G., Déqué, M., Badeau, V., Piou, D., Husson, C., Marçais, B., Simulating the effects of a climate-change scenario on the geographical range and activity of forest-pathogenic fungi (2007) Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology, 29, pp. 101-120; Esteves, I., Peteira, B., Powers, S., Magan, N., Kerry, B.R., Effects of osmotic stress and matric potential on radial growth and accumulation of endogenous reserves in three isolates of Pochonia chlamydosporia (2009) Biocontrol Science and Technology, 19, pp. 185-199; Gangwar, M., Cole, R., Ramani, R., Sheehan, D.J., Chaturvedi, V., application of fluorescent probes to study structural changes in Aspergillus fumigatus exposed to amphotericin B itraconazole and voriconazole (2006) Mycopathologia, 162, pp. 109-1109; Garret, K.A., Dendy, S.P., Frank, E.E., Rouse, M.N., Travers, S.E., Climate change effects on plant disease: genomes to ecosystem (2006) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 44, pp. 489-509; Gharieb, M.M., Gadd, G.M., The kinetics of 75[Se]-selenite uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the vacuolization response to high concentrations (2004) Mycological Research, 108, pp. 1415-1422; Graniti, A., Cypress canker: a pandemic in progress (1998) Annual Review of Phytopathology, 36, pp. 91-114; Graniti, A., Frisullo, S., The species of Seiridium associated with canker disease of cypress in the Mediterranean area (1990) Agrimed Research Programme.
