Lyngby, Denmark","Based on available technology and emission data seven selected management options for air-pollution-control (APC) residues from waste incineration were evaluated by life-cycle assessment (LCA) using the EASEWASTE model. Scenarios were evaluated with respect to both non-toxicity impact categories (e.g. global warming) and toxicity related impact categories (e.g. ecotoxicity and human toxicity). The assessment addressed treatment and final placement of 1. tonne of APC residue in seven scenarios: 1) direct landfilling without treatment (baseline), 2) backfilling in salt mines, 3) neutralization of waste acid, 4) filler material in asphalt, 5) Ferrox stabilization, 6) vitrification, and 7) melting with automobile shredder residues (ASR). The management scenarios were selected as examples of the wide range of different technologies available worldwide while at the same time using realistic technology data. Results from the LCA were discussed with respect to importance of: energy consumption/substitution, material substitution, leaching, air emissions, time horizon aspects for the assessment, and transportation distances. The LCA modeling showed that thermal processes were associated with the highest loads in the non-toxicity categories (energy consumption), while differences between the remaining alternatives were small and generally considered insignificant. In the toxicity categories, all treatment/utilization options were significantly better than direct landfilling without treatment (lower leaching), although the thermal processes had somewhat higher impacts than the others options (air emissions). Transportation distances did not affect the overall ranking of the management alternatives. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution control; APC; Hazardous waste; LCA; Residues; Waste incineration","Air emissions; Air pollution control residues; APC; APC-residues; Automobile shredder residue; Ecotoxicity; Emission data; Energy consumption; Filler materials; Hazardous wastes; Human toxicity; Landfilling; LCA; Life-cycle assessments; Management options; Management scenarios; Material substitutions; Non-toxicity; Residues; Technology data; Thermal process; Time horizons; Transportation distance; Waste acids; Air pollution control; Air quality; Energy utilization; Global warming; Hazardous materials; Leaching; Life cycle; Materials handling; Pollution; Pollution induced corrosion; Refuse incinerators; Salt mines; Toxicity; Waste treatment; Waste incineration; atmospheric pollution; hazardous waste; incineration; life cycle analysis; management practice; pollution control; toxicity; acidification; air pollution; air pollution control; article; chemical composition; controlled study; ecotoxicity; energy consumption; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; landfill; leaching; life cycle assessment; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; solid waste management; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; evaluation study; incineration; prevention and control; procedures; soil pollutant; waste management; water pollutant; water pollution; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Incineration; Soil Pollutants; Waste Management; Water Pollutants; Water Pollution; air pollutant; soil pollutant; water pollutant; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Incineration; Soil Pollutants; Waste Management; Water Pollutants; Water Pollution",,"Air Pollutants; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants; Air Pollutants; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants",,,,"Aberg, A., Kumpiene, J., Ecke, H., Evaluation and prediction of emissions from a road built with bottom ash from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) (2006) Sci Total Environ, 355, pp. 1-12; Aguiar del Toro, M., Calmano, W., Ecke, H., Wet extraction of heavy metals and chloride from MSWI and straw combustion fly ashes (2009) Waste Manage, 29, pp. 2494-2499; Andreola, F., Barbieri, L., Hreglich, S., Lancellotti, I., Morselli, L., Passarini, F., Reuse of incinerator bottom and fly ashes to obtain glassy materials (2008) J Hazard Mater, 153, pp. 1270-1274; Astrup, T., Management of APC residues from W-t-E Plants: an overview of management options and treatment methods (2008) Working Group on Thermal Treatment of Waste, , The International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), Copenhagen; Astrup, T., Pretreatment and utilization of waste incineration bottom ashes: Danish experiences (2007) Waste Manage, 27, pp. 1452-1457; Astrup, T., Mosbaek, H., Christensen, T.H., Assessment of long-term leaching from waste incineration air-pollution-control residues (2006) Waste Manage, 26, pp. 803-814; Astrup, T., Dijkstra, J.J., Comans, R.N.J., van der Sloot, H.A., Christensen, T.H., Geochemical modeling of leaching from MSWI air-pollution-control residues (2006) Environ Sci Technol, 40, pp. 3551-3557; Babbitt, C.W., Lindner, A.S., A life cycle comparison of disposal and beneficial use of coal combustion products in Florida.
