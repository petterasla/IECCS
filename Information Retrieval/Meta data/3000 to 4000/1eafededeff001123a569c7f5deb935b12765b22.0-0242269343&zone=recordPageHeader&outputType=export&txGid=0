Axes of evaluation consistent with sustainable energy strategies, economic growth, social welfare and environmental friendliness are explicitly considered. The aim of this study is to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive model which allows to assess environmental burdens (global warming potential and acidification potential) with respect to changes in economic activities consistent with distinct policy measures. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
