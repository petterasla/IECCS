A fuelcycle assessment of the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and direct injection retrofit technologies for these vehicles is conducted. The results when compared with carbureted two and four strokes units indicate that retrofitting the units to direct injection provides lower fossil energy depletion, global warming, human toxicity and photochemical ozone formation impact potentials compared to LPG fueled carbureted two stroke tricycles while the latter exhibits lower acidification and nutrification impact values. The direct injection retrofitted units show a lower aggregated impact score and dominance over four stroke units. The conversion to LPG revealed minimal environmental benefits compared to the gasoline run units. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
