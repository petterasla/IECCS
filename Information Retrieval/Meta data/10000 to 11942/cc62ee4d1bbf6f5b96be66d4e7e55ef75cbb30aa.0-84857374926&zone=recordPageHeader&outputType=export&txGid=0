A software application, named MareVB and in development since 2008, gets a 3 minute stream input of sea level height and a 10 minute stream input of air-pressure. Based on a predicted tide model, the sea level height is compared and analyzed, and storm-surge amplitude is determined, as well as the high frequency oscillation (seichas) due to the storm and tsunami waves. Using such real-time SLC data analysis, the application is now running as a coastal hazard warning system, emailing automatic warnings in real-time to national authorities and to other institutions and coworkers, where the levels of coastal hazards of SLC are considered. A post-processing monitoring of SLC is also performed and a time series is evaluated and actualized. Such SLC time series enables the statistics of storm-surges and the determination of the sea level rise rate associated to the global climate change and other regional phenomena. The computational methodology, the application for real-time monitoring and the statistics of storm-surges at Cascais for the period of last 10 years are presented here.","Cascais tide gauge; Real-time monitoring; Sea level change; Storm-surge","atmospheric pressure; climate change; coastal zone; global change; hazard assessment; Internet; monitoring; real time; sea level change; software; storm surge; tidal modeling; tide gauge; time series; tsunami; warning system; Cascais; Lisboa [Portugal]; Portugal",,,,,,"Antunes, C., (2007) Previsão de Marés Dos Portos Principais de Portugal, , http://webpages.fc.ul.pt/~cmantunes/hidrografia/hidro_mares.html; Antunes, C., Taborda, R., Sea level a Cascais Tide Gauge: Data, analysis and results. journal of coastal research, SI 56 (2009) Proceedings of the 10th International Coastal Symposium, pp. 218-222. , Lisbon, Portugal; Antunes, C., Taborda, R., Mendes, V., Analysis of the most recent data of Cascais Tide Gauge (2010) Geophysical Research Abstract, 12. , EGU2010-1253, EGU General Assembly 2010; Godin, G., (1972) The Analysis of Tides, 264p. , University of Toronto press; Relvas, P., Barton, E.D., Dubert, J., Oliveira, P.B., Peliz, A., Da Silva, J.C.B., Santos, A.M.P., Physical Oceanography of the Western Iberia Ecosystem: Latest views and challenges (2007) Progress in Oceanography, 74 (2-3), pp. 149-173; Taborda, R., Andrade, C., Marques, F., Freitas, C., Filipa, R., Antunes, C., (2010) Zonas Costeiras, 59p. , PECAC 2010.
