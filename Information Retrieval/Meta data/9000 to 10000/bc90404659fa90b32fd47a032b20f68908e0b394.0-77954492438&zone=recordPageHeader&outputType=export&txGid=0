Producers are responsible for take-back and recycling of discarded equipment. Valuable materials are, however, at risk of "" getting lost"" in current processes. Thus, strategies to minimize losses are sought after. The material hygiene (MH) concept was introduced to address this issue. Structural features, which are important for the outcome of reuse, recovery, and recycling, were investigated in an earlier field study of discarded dishwashers. It was proposed that a prestep, manual removal of copper prior to shredding could increase the purity of recovered material fractions. This article builds on the field study and theoretical reasoning underlying the MH concept. Dishwashers are assumed to be designed for disassembly when the prestep is introduced. A limited life cycle assessment was performed to determine whether the proposed prestep may be environmentally beneficial in a life cycle perspective. Two alternatives were analyzed:. Case 1: the current shredding process. Case 2: prestep removal of copper before shredding. Targeted disassembly prior to shredding may reduce the abiotic depletion and global warming potential in a life cycle perspective. The prestep results in increased copper recovery, but, more important, copper contamination of the recovered steel fractions is reduced. The results also highlight the importance of minimizing energy consumption in all process stages. © 2009 by Yale University.","Copper removal; Design for environment (DfE); Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Material hygiene; Shredding","Copper removal; Design for environment; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life-cycle assessments; Amplifiers (electronic); Environmental impact; Global warming; Materials; Oscillators (electronic); Recovery; Recycling; Waste treatment; Copper; copper; design; environmental impact; European Union; global warming; life cycle analysis; recycling",,,,,,"Barba-Gutiérrez, Y., Adenso-Díaz, B., Hopp, M., An analysis of some environmental consequences of European electrical and electronic waste regulation (2008) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 52 (3), pp. 481-495; (2006) Ecoinvent data v 1.3., , Ecoinvent Centre, Dübendorf, Switzerland, Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories; Ekerot, S., (2003) Stålets kretslopp[The steel ecocyle], , Jernkontorets Forskning nr D729, Stockholm, Sweden, Jernkontoret; Erasteel Kloster, A.B., et al, (2005) Skrotboken 2000[The scrapbook 2000], , First edition, revised 2005, Solna, Sweden, Järnbruksförnödenheter AB; (2002) Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), , European Union, Brussels, Belgium, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities; Hagelücken, C., Umicore precious metals: Statement in article EUWID (2006) Recycling and Waste Management, 3, pp. 4-5; Hischier, R., Wäger, P., Gauglhofer, J., Does WEEE recycling make sense from an environmental perspective?
