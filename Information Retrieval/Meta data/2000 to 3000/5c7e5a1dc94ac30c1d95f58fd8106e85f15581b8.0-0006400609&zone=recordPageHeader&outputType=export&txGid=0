Antarctic and Ocean Res., Goa 403 804, India","This paper discusses the features observed over the Antarctic in the passive microwave emission region by the multi-frequency scanning microwave radiometer (MSMR) instrument on-board the Indian remote sensing satellite IRS-P4, now called OCEANSAT-1. Brightness temperature images produced from MSMR show a clear distinction between open water and sea-ice-covered regions. It is also possible to differentiate several levels of ice concentration in the Antarctic Circumpolar Ocean. A number of land features like the Trans-Antarctic Mountain Ranges, part of Gamburtsev sub-glacial mountains, Wilkes and Aurora sub-glacial basins, etc. can be demarcated as well. The consistent quality and regular availability of MSMR data since June 1999 serve as a very useful tool in all-weather day-and-night monitoring of the Antarctic region. MSMR data used in continuation of ESMR, SMMR and SSM/I data, would prove valuable in the study of long-term changes in the polar cryosphere associated with global climate change.",,,,,,,,"Gloersen, P., Nordberg, W., Schmugge, T.J., Wilheit, T.T., Campbell, W.J., (1973) J.
