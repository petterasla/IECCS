Among these technologies, carbon dioxide (CO2) flooding is a highly attractive possibility. At the same time, a large amount of CO2 is being produced by coal-fired power plants in this region. The CO2 is currently discharged into the atmosphere and could be a major contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect, which would lead to global warming. Thus, the concept of capturing CO2 and utilizing it as a flooding agent in EOR processes is currently generating much interest among oil, utility and coal companies. This paper describes how cogeneration concepts, together with process optimization strategies, help to reduce the CO2 production cost by utilizing low-pressure steam and waste heat from various sections of the power generation process. Based on these concepts and strategies, results from this study show that the recovery cost of CO2 from a coal-fired power plant can range between $0.50 - 2.00/mscf. If the cost is approximately $1.25/mscf, the production cost of a barrel of incremental oil would be less than $18. Therefore, at modest oil prices, there is room for profit to be made operating a CO2 flood with flue gas extracted CO2. The technical and economic feasibility of the concepts are evaluated and practical implications for the Saskatchewan resources are discussed.",,"Coalfired power stations; Economic feasibility study; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Oil well flooding; Enhanced recovery",,,,,,"(1989) Saskatchewan Energy and Mines, Boundary Dam CO2 Extraction Pilot Plant: Final Report; (1992) IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, Carbon Dioxide Capture; Tontiwachwuthikul, P., (1995) Proceedings of the 46th Annual Technical Meeting of the Petroleum Society Banff, Canada; (1993) CO2 Disposal Study; (1992) Cost Analysis of Controlling Carbon Dioxide Flue Gas Emissions; Limaye, D.R., (1987) Industrial Cogeneration Applications, , Fairmont Press, Lilburn, GA; Hyland, M.J., (1985) Petroleum Engineer International, 57, pp. 24-28; Blunt, M., Fayers, F.J., Orr, F.M., (1993) Energy Conversion and Management, 34, pp. 1197-1204; Bailey, R.T., Mcdonald, M.M., (1993) Energy Conversion and Management, 34, pp. 1145-1150; Andenhengel, W.V., Miyagishina, W., (1993) Energy Conversion and Management, 34, pp. 1151-1156; Todd, M.R., Grand, G.W., (1993) Energy Conversion and Management, 34, pp. 1157-1164; Padamsay, R., Railton, J., (1993) Energy Conversion and Management, 34, pp. 1165-1176; Astarita, G., (1982) Gas Treating with Chemical Solvents, , John Wiley, New York; Blunt, M., (1993) Energy Conversion and Management, 34, pp. 1197-1204; Tontiwachwuthikul, P., Research and Development Activities on High Efficiency Separation Process Technologies for Carbon Dioxide Removal from Industrial Sources (1996) Energy Conversion and Management: An International Journal, 37 (6-8), pp. 935-940","University of ReginaCanada",,,,,,,,00219487,,JCPMA,,"English","J Can Pet Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032202986
