OM biomarker characterization of solvent-extractable compounds and CuO oxidation products of littoral sedimentary OM in the Canadian Arctic was conducted to determine OM sources and decomposition patterns. The solvent-extracts contained a series of aliphatic lipids, steroids and one triterpenoid of higher plant origin as well as the low abundance of iso- and anteiso-alkanes originating from Cerastium arcticum (Arctic mouse-ear chickweed), a native angiosperm. The carbon preference index (CPI) of the n-alkane, n-alkanol and n-alkanoic acid biomarkers suggests relatively fresh lipid material in the early stages of degradation. The CuO oxidation products were comprised of benzenes, lignin-derived phenols and short-chain diacids and hydroxyacids. A high abundance of these terrestrial biomarkers at sites close to the river inlet suggests soil-derived fluvial inputs are an important source of OM delivered to the littoral sediments. The high lignin-derived phenol ratios of acids to aldehydes suggest that lignin degradation is in a relatively advanced oxidation stage. The absence of ergosterol, a common fungal biomarker also suggests that lignin-derived OM may be preserved in soil OM and transported to littoral sediments. This representative OM characterization suggests that Arctic sedimentary OM is a mixture of recently deposited and/or preserved lipids in permafrost melt and oxidized lignin-derived OM that may become destabilized from external influences such as climate change. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Anteiso-alkanes; Biomarkers; Iso-alkanes; Lignin; Lipids; Littoral sediments; Organic matter","aldehyde; aliphatic hydrocarbon; alkane; assessment method; biodegradation; biomarker; climate change; ergosterol; global climate; herb; littoral environment; organic matter; oxidation; permafrost; phenol; sediment analysis; sensitivity analysis; solvent; steroid; terpene; vulnerability; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Cerastium; Cerastium arcticum; Embryophyta; Magnoliophyta",,,,,,"Amelung, W., Flach, K.-W., Kech, W., Lignin in particle size fractions of native grassland soils as influenced by climate (1999) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 63, pp. 1222-1228; Arnold, R., Convey, P., Huges, K.A., Wynn-Williams, D.D., Seasonal periodicity of physical factors, inorganic nutrients and microalgae in Antarctic fellfields (2003) Polar Biol, 26, pp. 396-403; Benner, R., Weliky, K., Hedges, J.I., Early diagenesis of mangrove leaves in a tropical estuary: molecular-level analysis of neutral sugars and lignin-derived phenols (1990) Geochim Cosmochim Acta, 54, pp. 1991-2001; Bertilsson, S.D., Stepanauskas, R., Cuadros-Hansson, R., Graneli, W., Wikner, J., Tranvik, L., Photochemically induced changes in bioavailable carbon and nitrogen pools in a boreal watershed (1999) Aquat Microb Ecol, 19, pp. 47-56; Bianchi, G., Plant Waxes (1995) Waxes: Chemistry, Molecular Biology and Functions, , R.
