Although it has been argued that global warming may lead to a shift from light to heavy rain, regionally little correspondence is found between light rain trends and temperature/precipitable water (PW) trends. This argues for the need to include other factors such as atmospheric circulation and aerosol changes that affect regional rain rates and cloud processes.
