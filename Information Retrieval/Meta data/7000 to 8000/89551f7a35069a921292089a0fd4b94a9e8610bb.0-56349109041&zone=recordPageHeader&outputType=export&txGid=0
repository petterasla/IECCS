However, this 'fingerprint' of climate change is yet to be assessed for an entire flora. Here, we examine patterns of altitudinal range change in the complete native vascular flora of sub-Antarctic Marion Island. We demonstrate a rapid mean upslope expansion in the flora since 1966, in response to 1.2°C warming on the island. The 3.4 ± 0.8 m yr-1 (mean ± SE) upslope expansion rate documented is amongst the highest estimates from partial floras. However, less than half of the species in the flora were responsible for the expansion trend, demonstrating that the global fingerprint of warming may be driven by a highly responsive subset of the species pool. Individual range expansion rates varied greatly, with species-specific niche requirements explaining some of this variation. As a result of the idiosyncratic expansion rates, altitudinal patterns of species richness and community composition changed considerably, with the formation of no-analog communities at high and intermediate altitudes. Therefore, both species- and community-level changes have occurred in the flora of Marion Island over a relatively short period of rapid warming, demonstrating the sensitivity of high latitude communities to climate change. Patterns of change within this flora illustrate the range of variation in species responses to climate change and the consequences thereof for species distributions and community reorganization. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Altitudinal range; Climate change; Elevational limits; Individualistic responses; Microhabitat; Range boundaries; Vegetation change","altitudinal zonation; climate change; climate effect; community composition; flora; global change; microhabitat; niche partitioning; site effect; species richness; temperature effect; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Marion Island; Prince Edward Islands",,,,,,"Archaux, F., Breeding upwards when climate is becoming warmer: No bird response in the French Alps (2004) Ibis, 146, pp. 138-144; Bergstrom, D.M., Chown, S.L., Life at the front: History, ecology and change on Southern Ocean islands (1999) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 14, pp. 472-477; Bergstrom, D.M., Smith, V.R., Alien vascular flora of Marion and Prince Edward Islands: New species, present distribution and status (1990) Antarctic Science, 2, pp. 301-308; Bloomer, J.P., Bester, M.N., Diet of a declining feral cat Felis catus population on Marion Island (1990) South African Journal of Wildlife Research, 20, pp. 1-4; Bloomer, J.P., Bester, M.N., Control of feral cats on sub-Antarctic Marion Island, Indian Ocean (1992) Biological Conservation, 60, pp. 211-219; Burger, A.E., Lindeboom, H.J., Williams, A.J., The mineral and energy contributions of guano of selected species of birds to the Marion Island terrestrial ecosystem (1978) South African Journal of Antarctic Research, 8, pp. 59-70; Cannone, N., Sgorbati, S., Gugfielmin, M., Unexpected impacts of climate change on alpine vegetation (2007) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 5, pp. 360-364; Chapuis, J.-L., Frenot, Y., Lebouvier, M., Recovery of native plant communities after eradication of rabbits from the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands, and influence of climate change (2004) Biological Conservation, 117, pp. 167-179; Chown, S.L., Smith, V.R., Climate change and the short-term impact of feral house mice at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (1993) Oecologia, 96, pp. 508-516; Croll, D.A., Maron, J.L., Estes, J.A., Danner, E.M., Byrd, G.V., Introduced predators transform subarctic islands from grassland to tundra (2005) Science, 307, pp. 1959-1961; Danby, R.K., Hik, D.S., Variability, contingency and rapid change in recent subarctic alpine tree line dynamics (2007) Journal of Ecology, 95, pp. 352-363; Davis, A.J., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Jenkinson, L.S., Individualistic species responses invalidate simple physiological models of community dynamics under global environmental change (1998) Journal of Animal Ecology, 67, pp. 600-612; Davis, M.B., Shaw, R.G., Range shifts and adaptive responses to Quaternary climate change (2001) Science, 292, pp. 673-679; Dubey, B., Yadav, R.R., Singh, J., Chaturvedi, R., Upward shift of Himalayan pine in Western Himalaya, India (2003) Current Science (Bangalore), 85, pp. 1135-1136; Franco, A.M.A., Hill, J.K., Kitschke, C., Impacts of climate warming and habitat loss on extinctions at species' low-latitude range boundaries (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 1545-1553; Grabherr, G., Gottfried, M., Pauli, H., Climate effects on mountain plants (1994) Nature, 369, p. 448; Gremmen, N.J.M., (1981) The Vegetation of the Sub-Antarctic Islands, Marion and Prince Edward, , Junk, the Hague; Gremmen, N.J.M., Changes in the vegetation of sub-Antarctic Marion Island resulting from introduced vascular plants (1997) Antarctic Communities: Species, Structure and Survival, pp. 417-423. , In: (eds Battaglia B, Valencia J, Walton DWH), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Gremmen, N.J.M., Smith, V.R., New records of alien vascular plants from Marion and Prince Edward Islands, sub-Antarctic (1999) Polar Biology, 21, pp. 401-409; Gremmen, N.J.M., Smith, V.R., (2004) The Flora of Marion and Prince Edward Islands.
