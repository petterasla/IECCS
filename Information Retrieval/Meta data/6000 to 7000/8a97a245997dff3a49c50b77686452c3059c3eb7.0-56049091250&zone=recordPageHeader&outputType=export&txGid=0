In this study, to get a comprehensive picture of current scientific knowledge about global warming issues, we developed a mapping framework for global warming research based on the relationships between nature and human society. The mapping includes seven phases: (1) socioeconomic activity and greenhouse gas emissions, (2) carbon cycle and carbon concentration, (3) climate change and global warming, (4) impacts on ecosystems and human society, (5) adaptation, (6) mitigation, and (7) social systems. We applied the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report to the mapping. The quantity of research results and their reliability were analyzed on the basis of expert judgment to better understand the extent to which current scientific knowledge provides answers to society's major concerns. The quantity and reliability of answers have increased in phases 2 and 3 relative to research in the Third Assessment Report. Although a large quantity of results have been produced in phases 4 and 6, they are not always sufficient. More studies are required in phases 1, 5, and 7, and the reliability of existing knowledge needs to be improved in these phases. Mapping global warming issues enabled us to visually comprehend the numerous and varied parts of global warming research as a whole and to discern gaps in knowledge and other research shortfalls. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2008.","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation; Research mapping; Structuring knowledge",,,,,,,"Bozeman, B., (2003) Public Value Mapping of Science Outcomes: Theory and Method, , Center for Science, Policy and Outcomes, Washington, DC; Cash, D.W., Clark, W.C., Alcock, F., Dickson, N.M., Eckley, N., Guston, D.H., Jager, J., Mitchell, R.B., Knowledge systems for sustainable development (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100 (14), pp. 8086-8091; Choucri, N., Mistree, D., Baker, W.R., Haghseta, F., Ortiz, C.I., Mezher, T., Mapping sustainability: Knowledge e-networking and the value chain (2007) Alliance for Global Sustainability Book Series, 11. , Springer, Berlin; Clark, W.C., Sustainability science: A room of its own.
