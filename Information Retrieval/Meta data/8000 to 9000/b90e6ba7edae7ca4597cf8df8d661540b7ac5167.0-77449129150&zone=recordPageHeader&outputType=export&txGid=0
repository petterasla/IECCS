Phys. 5, 15784 Athens, Greece","Total ozone and atmospheric temperature are two variables that are closely connected with two important environmental problems: ozone depletion and global warming. Vertical temperature profiles and column ozone data are analysed to explore the relationship between these two variables at various levels in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over Athens, Greece during the period 1992-2004. The results obtained show an out-of-phase relationship between total ozone and temperature in the troposphere and an in-phase relationship in the lower stratosphere. Such a phase change is characteristic of all seasons. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",,"Athens , Greece; Column ozone; Environmental problems; In-phase; Lower stratosphere; Out of phase; Ozone depletion; Phase Change; Total ozone; Vertical temperature profile; Atmospherics; Global warming; Ozone; Ozone layer; Sulfur compounds; Superalloys; Troposphere; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; global warming; ozone depletion; remote sensing; stratosphere; temperature profile; total ozone; troposphere; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece",,,,,,"Bojkov, R.D., Komhyr, W.D., Lapworth, A., Vanicek, K., (1993) Handbook for Dobson Ozone Data Re-evaluation, , WMO Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project, Report No 29, WMO/TDK-No.597 (Geneva: World Meteorological Organization); Chandra, S., Varotsos, C.A., Recent trends of the total column ozone-implications for the Mediterranean region (1995) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 16, pp. 1765-1769; Chandra, S., Varotsos, C., Flynn, L.E., The mid-latitude total ozone trends in the Northern Hemisphere (1996) Geophysical Research Letters, 23, pp. 555-558; Cortesi, U., Lambert, J.C., de Clercq, C., Bianchini, G., Blumenstock, T., Bracher, A., Castelli, E., Wood, S., Geophysical validation of MIPAS-ENVISAT operational ozone data (2007) Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 7, pp. 4807-4867; Cracknell, A.P., Varotsos, C.A., The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the fiftieth anniversary of Sputnik (2007) Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 14, pp. 384-387; Dobson, G.M.B., The laminated structure of the ozone in the atmosphere (1973) Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 99, pp. 599-607; Efstathiou, M., Varotsos, C., Kondratyev, K.Y., An estimation of the surface solar ultraviolet irradiance during an extreme total ozone minimum (1998) Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics, 68, pp. 171-176; Efstathiou, M.N., Varotsos, C.A., Singh, R.P., Cracknell, A.P., Tzanis, C., On the longitude dependence of total ozone trends over middle-latitudes (2003) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 24, pp. 1361-1367; Feretis, E., Theodorakopoulos, P., Varotsos, C., Efstathiou, M., Tzanis, C., Xirou, T., Alexandridou, N., Aggelou, M., On the plausible association between environmental conditions and human eye damage (2002) Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 9, pp. 163-165; Gernandt, H., Goersdorf, U., Claude, H., Varotsos, C.A., Possible impact of polar stratospheric processes on mid-latitude vertical ozone distributions (1995) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 16, pp. 1839-1850; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf, IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
