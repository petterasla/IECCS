The floods commenced after decades of downwasting and retreat of the glacier from its Holocene maximum position, which it achieved in the nineteenth century. Hydrometric data and other records are used to reconstruct the times and peak discharges of floods from two glacier-dammed lakes. Tulsequah Lake formed in the early 1900s when a tributary glacier separated from Tulsequah Glacier, creating an ice-free embayment between the two. The lake grew rapidly in surface area and volume in the first half of the twentieth century, but later, with continued glacier retreat, it decreased in size. The first jökulhlaups from Tulsequah Lake were the largest. Peak and total discharges decreased as the lake became smaller. Today, Tulsequah Lake is small, and it will disappear completely if Tulsequah Glacier retreats any further. A second lake (Lake No Lake), however, has formed and grown in size as Tulsequah Lake has diminished. Lake No Lake developed from a subglacial water body in a tributary valley, 7 km upglacier from Tulsequah Lake. Like Tulsequah Lake, Lake No Lake rapidly grew in area and volume during its youth, and in the 1970s it began to generate its own jökulhlaups. Lake No Lake appears to be following the same evolutionary path as Tulsequah Lake - its volume is now decreasing due to downwasting of Tulsequah Glacier, and its jökulhlaups are beginning to diminish. As Tulsequah Glacier continues to shrink in response to climatic warming, additional glacier-dammed lakes may form, renewing the cycle of outburst flood activity. Such behaviour can be expected in other high mountains because most alpine glaciers are retreating in response to global warming. © 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.","British Columbia; Canada; Climate change; Flood hazard; Glacier retreat; Ice-dammed lake; Jökulhlaup; Tulsequah Glacier","climate change; flooding; glacier retreat; ice-dammed lake; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Western Hemisphere; World",,,,,,"Clague, J.J., Evans, S.G., (1994) Formation and Failure of Natural Dams in the Canadian Cordillera, 35p. , Geological Survey of Canada, Bulletin 464; Eisbacher, G.H., Clague, J.J., (1984) Destructive Mass Movements in High Mountains: Hazard and Management, 230p. , Geological Survey of Canada, Paper 84-16; Evans, S.G., Clague, J.J., Recent climate change and catastrophic geomorphic processes in mountain environments (1994) Geomorphology, 10, pp. 107-128; Gottesfeld, A.S., Johnson Gottesfeld, A.S., Floodplain dynamics of a wandering river, dendrochronology of the Morice River, British Columbia, Canada (1990) Geomorphology, 3, pp. 159-179; Grove, J.M., (1988) The Little Ice Age, 498p. , London: Methuen; Haeberli, W., Frequency and characteristics of glacier floods in the Swiss Alps (1983) Annals of Glaciology, 4, pp. 85-90; Haeberli, W., Alean, J.-C., Muller, P., Funk, M., Assessing the risks from glacier hazards in high mountain regions: Some experiences in the Swiss Alps (1989) Annals of Glaciology, 13, pp. 77-101; Hewitt, K., Natural dams and outburst floods of the Karakoram Himalaya (1982) Hydrological Aspects of Alpine and High-mountain Areas, pp. 259-269. , Glen, J.W., editor, International Association of Scientific Hydrology Publication 138; Holland, S.S., (1976) Landforms of British Columbia, 138p. , BC Department of Mines and Petroleum Resources, Bulletin 48; (1952) Joint Report Upon the Survey and Demarcation of the Boundary between Canada and the United States from Tongass Passage to Mount St Elias, 365p. , Washington: US Department of State; Kerr, F.A., The ice dam and floods of the Talsekwe, British Columbia (1934) Geographical Review, 24, pp. 643-645; Quaternary glaciation in the Coast Range, northern British Columbia and Alaska (1936) Journal of Geology, 44, pp. 681-700; Taku River map-area, British Columbia (1948) Geological Survey of Canada, Memoir, 248; Marcus, M.G., Periodic drainage of glacier-dammed Tulsequah Lake, British Columbia (1960) Geographical Review, 50, pp. 89-106; Post, A., Mayo, L.R., Glacier-dammed lakes and outburst floods in Alaska (1971) US Geological Survey, Hydrologic Investigations Atlas, HA-455, 10p. , 1:1000000 scale map; Richardson, S.D., Reynolds, J.M., An overview of glacial hazards in the Himalayas (2000) Quaternary International, 65-66, pp. 31-47; Septer, D., Schwab, J.W., (1995) Rainstorm and Flood Damage: Northwest British Columbia 1891-1991, 196p. , BC Ministry of Forests, Land Management Report 31; Souther, J.G., Geology and mineral deposits of Tulsequah map-area, British Columbia (104K) (1971) Geological Survey of Canada, Memoir, 362, 84p; Stone, K.H., (1955) Alaskan Ice-dammed Lakes, , Final Report to the Arctic Institute of North America on Project ONR 67, Madison, Wisconsin; Sturm, M., Benson, C.S., A history of jökulhlaups from Strandline Lake, Alaska (1985) Journal of Glaciology, 31, pp. 272-280; Thorarinsson, S., The ice-dammed lakes of Iceland with particular reference to their value as indicators of glacial oscillations (1939) Geografisker Annaler, 21, pp. 216-242","Geertsema, M.; BC Ministry of Forests, Northern Interior Forest Region, 1011 4th Avenue, Prince George, BC V2L 3H9, Canada; email: marten.geertsema@gems3.gov.bc.ca",,,,,,,,09596836,,HOLOE,,"English","Holocene",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-15944398354
