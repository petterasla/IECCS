Looking ahead, it is foreseen that rainfall and its patterns will be altered due to the climate change accompanied by global warming, and there is concern that the intensity and frequency of flood disasters might be exacerbated. This paper aims to introduce flood characteristics and management policies in Japan that have been undertaken for a long time in order to mitigate these recurrent flood disasters. It also highlights extremely devastating floods in some areas that occurred under recent climate variability, and to address the progress in the assessment of hydro-meteorological tendencies and in the promotion of dialogue among climatologists and hydrologists. Lastly, a new initiative to establish an international centre on water-related hazards and its risk management is presented. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Climate variability; Dialogue on water and climate; Flood disaster; Flood management","Climate change; Climatology; Global warming; Meteorology; Public policy; Flood damages; Flood management; Management policies; Flood control; rain; climate variation; disaster management; flooding; hazard management; article; climate change; disaster; disaster planning; flooding; futurology; greenhouse effect; hazard; hydrology; Japan; policy; risk management; Climate; Disaster Planning; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Japan; Meteorological Factors; Natural Disasters; Rain; Water Movements; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; World",,,,,,"Climate change influence on flood and drought in East Asia; Effect and response (2003), Exploratory Committee for Climate Change Influence on Flood and Drought"" in East Asia Session Report for the 3rd World Water Forum, March 2003, Kyoto, JapanFukami, K., Evaluation of DAD curves of the Tokai rainstorm in September of 2000 (2003), Presentation paper for the 3rd DPRI-IIASA International Symposium, July 2003, Kyoto, JapanTone River 100-years Report (1987), Kanto Regional Construction Bureau, Ministry of Construction Tokyo, Japan (in Japanese)Yokota, S., Trend of climatic index (2003), Working paper, Japan Meteorological Agency, Tokyo, Japan (in Japanese)","Ikeda, T.; Secretariat for Preparatory Activities, UNESCO-PWRI Centre, Public Works Research Institute, 1-6 Minamihara, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8516, Japan; email: whrm@pwri.go.jp",,,,,,,,02731223,,WSTED,15918366,"English","Water Sci.
