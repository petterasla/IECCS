Thus, it is very sensitive to climatic changes. Simple relations based upon conductive heat transfer, with thawing and geothermal heat flow, are presented to predict the transient effects of surface temperature increases on the thermal state of permafrost. The results indicate that, based on the usual global warming scenarios, relatively small amounts of permafrost will disappear within 50-100 years. This is specifically shown for the most thermally sensitive cases, that is, warm or relict permafrost.","Climate change; Modelling; Permafrost degradation",,,,,,,"Brigham, J.K., Miller, G.H., Paleotemperature estimates of the Alaskan Arctic coastal plain during the last 125,000 years (1983) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Permafrost, pp. 80-85. , National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Brown, R.J.E., Péwé, T.L., Distribution of permafrost in North America and its relation to the environment: A review 1963-1973 (1973) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Permafrost, pp. 71-100. , National Academy of Sciences Press, Washington, DC; Climatic changes of the last 18000 years: Observations and model simulations (1988) Science, 241, pp. 1043-1052; Dansgaard, W., Oeschger, H., Past environ mental long-term records from the Arctic (1989) The Environmental Record in Glaciers and Ice Sheets, pp. 288-317. , Oescher, H. and Langway, C.
