The study aimed at identifying shrubs for dryland agroforestry based on agronomic and fodder quality attributes. Fodder and wood yield, percent fodder (FBR) and fodder quality of 26 non-legume shrubs were determined from 6 to 8 months regrowth in north-west Syria. Seed yield was estimated from plants that were not cut. Fodder (31-87 Mg DM ha-1), wood (16-2064 Mg DM ha-1) and seed (0-132 Mg DM ha-1) yield, FBR (24-87%), fodder concentrations of crude protein (69-195 g kg -1.), acid detergent lignin (ADL) (24-109 g kg-1), acid detergent fiber (ADF) (102-267 g kg-1), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (214-526 g kg-1), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) (391-526 g kg-1), and in vitro gas production after 24 h of incubation (25-39 ml 200 mg-1 DM) varied (P &lt; 0.05) among the shrubs. Atriplex halimus-halimus and A. herba-alba from Spain, A. canescens, A. ploycarpa and A. lentiformis from USA, A. halimus and A. herba-alba from Syria and A. nummularia from Australia and South Africa had greater potential for development of dryland agroforestry technologies. The promising shrubs could be integrated into the rangeland-crop-livestock systems in non-tropical dryland environs to provide fodder, fuel-wood, shade, medicine, stabilize sand-dunes, and sequester carbon; thereby contributing to mitigation of rangeland degradation and global warming; if major constraints to adoption of fodder trees such as agronomic problems, low multipurpose value, land shortage and quality seed supply could be overcome. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chemical composition;
