The 1990s will be the critical decade during which collective concern must be turned into concerted action through global climate conventions and related protocols. This article proposes such a strategy with the following elements: setting of a warming ceiling and a rate of change per decade; development of emission scenarios which come close to the set limits using climate modeling; allocation of emission shares by nation; assessment of emission reduction potential by gas, source, measure and nation; development of national emission reduction plans; agreement, implementation and supervision of such plans; establishment of a climate fund. The effectiveness of scenarios is assessed using a one dimensional(1-D) climate model from 1860 to 2100. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide; climate protection; climatic change; emission reduction; environmental planning; international cooperation; Montreal Protocol; ozone layer; protection policy; protocol; simulation model; trace gas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00447447,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026281834
