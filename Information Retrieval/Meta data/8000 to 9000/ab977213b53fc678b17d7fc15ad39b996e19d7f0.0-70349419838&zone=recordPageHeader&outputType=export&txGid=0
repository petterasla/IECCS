An effort was made to correlate the variance of radon concentrations in spring water and soil-gas with meteorological parameters at the same location. The main meteorological parameters that affect the radon emanation from host material is surrounding temperature, barometric pressure, wind velocity, rain fall and water level of the spring. The correlation coefficient between radon concentration in spring water and different atmospheric parameters was computed. The correlation coefficient between radon concentration in spring water and the maximum atmospheric temperature was 0.3, while it was 0.4 for minimum atmospheric temperature at the monitoring site. The correlation coefficient for radon concentration in spring water with minimum and maximum relative humidity was 0.4. Spring water radon concentration was found positively correlated (0.6) with water discharge rate of the spring. A weak correlation (0.09) was observed between the radon concentration in spring water and rain fall during the measurement period. As temperature of near surface soil increases, the radon emanation coefficient from the soil surface also increases. The possible effects due to global warming and other climatic changes on environment radiation level were also discussed in detail. © 2009 IACS.","Meteorology; Radon; Transfer efficiency",,,,,,,"Planinic, J., Radolic, V., Lazanin, Z., (2001) Appl.
