Global climate change is likely to impact plants and animals, as well as microorganisms. The World Health Organization, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change cite increased allergic reactions due to climate change as a growing concern. Monitoring of indoor and ambient particulate matter (PM) and the characterization of the content for biological aerosol concentrations has not been extensively performed. Samples from urban and rural North Carolina (NC), and Denver (CO), were collected and analyzed as the goal of this research. A study of PM10 (&lt;10 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and PM2.5 (&lt;2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) fractions of ambient bioaerosols was undertaken for a six month period to evaluate the potential for long-term concentrations. These airborne bioaerosols can induce irritational, allergic, infectious, and chemical responses in exposed individuals. Three separate sites were monitored, samples were collected and analyzed for mass and biological content (endotoxins, (1,3)-β-d-glucan and protein). Concentrations of these bioaerosols were reported as a function of PM size fraction, mass and volume of air sampled. The results indicated that higher concentrations of biologicals were present in PM10 than were present in PM2.5, except when near-roadway conditions existed. This study provides the characterization of ambient bioaerosol concentrations in a variety of areas and conditions.","(1,3)-β-d-glucan; Bioaerosols; Endotoxin; Particulate matter; PM; Protein","Aerodynamic diameters; Allergic disease; Allergic reactions; Ambient particulate Matter; Bioaerosols; Biological Aerosol; Department of healths; Global climate changes; Human services; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; North Carolina; Particulate Matter; Size fraction; U.s. department of agricultures; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; World Health Organization; Aerodynamics; Animals; Concentration (process); Environmental Protection Agency; Proteins; Climate change; endotoxin; aerosol; asthma; climate change; indoor air; microorganism; particulate matter; protein; rural atmosphere; urban atmosphere; air analysis; air monitoring; airborne particle; allergy; ambient air; article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; indoor air pollution; infection; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; rural area; United States; urban area; Colorado; Denver; North America; North Carolina; United States; Animalia",,,,,,"Baldauf, R., Thoma, E., Isakov, V., Long, T., Weinstein, J., Gilmour, I., Cho, S., Costa, D., Traffic and meteorological impacts on near road air quality: summary of methods and trends from the Raleigh near road study (2008) Journal of Air and Waste Management, 58 (7), p. 865; Beggs, P.J., Bambrick, H.J., Is the global rise of asthma an early impact of anthropogenic climate change?
