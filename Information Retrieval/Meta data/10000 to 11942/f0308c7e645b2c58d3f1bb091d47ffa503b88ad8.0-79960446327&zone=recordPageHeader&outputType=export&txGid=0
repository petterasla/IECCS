In order to study the combined effect of temperature and UVB increase, on the phytoplankton community in the Saint Lawrence Estuary, duplicates of four different treatments were applied to 2m 3 mesocosms to simulate an overall 3°C and a 77.8% UVB increase, and combined. Samples were collected every 6h over 10days and the phytoplankton community was then analysed using a conventional flow cytometer and a Cytosense flow cytometer. Flow cytometry distinguished 9 clusters (Pico, Nano I, C3, C4, CHAINS, C6, C7 and C8) of cells sharing similar optical properties with average sizes varying from 1.3μm up to 101μm for chain forming cells. Compared to untreated enclosures, the high UVB treatment induced lower cell abundances (up to -40%) for clusters Pico, Nano I, C4, CHAINS and C7, followed by an unexpected cell abundance increase in all the clusters during the last 3days of the experiment (up to 46%). This increase was sustained by faster calculated periodicities of the cell optical characteristics and abundances, linked to a shorter cell cycle. In the samples from the high temperature treatment mesocosms, a positive delay was observed for the cell abundance increase in clusters CHAINS, C6 and C8, combined with higher average abundance values (up to 67% with respect to untreated mesocosms). During the last 3days of the experiment, abundances decreased compared to the values observed in the high UVB mesocosms, with a slower trend in the periodicities, suggesting that high temperature inhibits the cell cycle. The combined temperature and UVB treatment emphasized the effects observed under high temperature treatments, maintaining temperature positive effects (i.e. higher abundances) on clusters C3, CHAINS, C6 and C8 suggesting a compensation from the positive temperature effects over the negative (i.e. lower abundances) UVB effects. Increasing temperature induced a negative effect on the abundance of clusters C4 and C7. In this case, trends in C6 and C8 cell periodicities were faster than under normal conditions while Nano I, C4 and C7 cycles were slower. Cells&lt;3μm were negatively affected by the combined exposure (up to -55% compared to untreated mesocosms) while most of the larger cells were positively affected (up to 75% compared to untreated mesocosms), suggesting a shift to an herbivorous food web (sensu Legendre and Rassoulzadegan, 1995). Results suggest that changes in cell cycles due to increases in temperature or UVB exposure may play an important role in controlling abundance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Flow cytometry; Global warming; Mesocosm experiment; Phytoplankton dynamics; Temperature; Ultra violet B","abundance; community response; compensation; cytology; experimental study; flow cytometry; food web; global warming; mesocosm; optical property; periodicity; phytoplankton; temperature effect; ultraviolet B radiation; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Saint Lawrence Estuary",,,,,,"Barbieri, E.S., Villafañe, V.E., Helbling, E.W., Experimental assessment of UV effects on temperate marine phytoplankton when exposed to variable radiation regimes (2002) Limnology and Oceanography, 47, pp. 1648-1655; Baulch, H.M., Schindler, D.W., Turner, M.A., Findlay, D.L., Paterson, M.J., Vinebrooke, R.D., (2005) Effects of warming on benthic communities in a boreal lake: implications of climate change, p. 16. , American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Waco, TX, United States; Belzile, C., Demers, S., Ferreyra, G.A., Schloss, I., Nozais, C., Lacoste, K., Mostajir, B., Vernet, M., UV effects on marine planktonic food webs: a synthesis of results from mesocosm studies (2006) Photochemistry and Photobiology, 82, pp. 850-856; Binder, B.J., DuRand, M.D., Diel cycles in surface waters of the equatorial Pacific (2002) Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 49, pp. 2601-2617; Bothwell, M.L., Sherbot, D.M.J., Pollock, C.M., Ecosystem response to solar ultraviolet-B radiation: influence of trophic-level interactions (1994) Science, 265, pp. 97-100; Buma, A.G.J., Boelen, P., Jeffery, W.H., UVR-induced DNA damage in aquatic organisms (2003) UV Effects in Aquatic Organisms and Ecosystems, pp. 291-327. , Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK, E.R.
