Using a baseline climatology, a GCM global warning scenario, a newly derived soil water-holding capacity data set, and a worldwide survey of soil degradation between 1950 and 1980, four climate and soil degradation scenarios are created to simulate the potential impact of global warming and soil degradation on African water resources for the 2010-2039 time period. Results indicate that, on a continental scale, the impact of global warming will be significantly greater than the impact of soil degradation. However, when only considering the locations where desertification is an issue (wet and dry climate regions), the potential effects of these two different human impacts on local water resources can be expected to be on the same order of magnitude. Drying associated with global warming is primarily the result of increased water demand (potential evapotranspiration) across the entire continent. While there are small increases in precipitation under global warming conditions, they are inadequate to meet the increased water demand. Soil degradation is most severe in highly populated, wet and dry climate regions and results in decreased water-holding capacities in these locations. This results in increased water surplus conditions during wet seasons when the soil's ability to absorb precipitation is reduced. At the same time, water deficits in these locations increase because of reduced soil water availability in the dry seasons. The net result of the combined scenarios is an intensification and extension of drought conditions during dry seasons."], "title": "Future African water resources: Interactions between soil degradation and global warming"},

The lithology of the deposits in these sequences was controlled largely by the prevailing climate and this influence was imposed also upon early diagenesis. The change from the cold, glacial climate to the cool temperate, postglacial environment is reflected by a change from a mineralogically immature composition (arkosic chloritic) of the glacial periglacial sediments, to a mature, kaolinite pyrite quartz dominated lithofacies of the deglaciation deposits. A typical feature of the latter period is the appearance of black, kaolinitic lutites, usually with a high organic C content. From the many occurrences, only a few examples of typical deglaciation sequences are discussed in this paper, including Tanzania, southern Oman, the Lesser Himalaya, northwestern Australia and southwest China. Microflora and fauna demonstrate that all these deglaciation sequences are of Late Asselian to Early Sakmarian age, indicating that deglaciation along the Tethyan margin of Gondwana was, within the limit of the dating methods, a synchronuous event. A peak in sea level in the Late Sakmarian/Early Artinskian, experienced in all but one of the sections described, supports this statement.

Here we address uncertainties in impacts, and provide a method for quantitative estimation of the policy implications of such uncertainties. To calculate an 'optimal' control rate or carbon tax a climate-economy model can be used on estimates of climate damages resulting from warming scenarios and several other key assumptions. The dynamic integrated climate-economy (DICE) model, in its original specification, suggested that an efficient policy for slowing global warming would incorporate only a relatively modest amount of abatement of greenhouse gas emissions, via the mechanism of a small (about $5 per ton initially) carbon tax. Here, the DICE model is reformulated to reflect several alternate published estimates and opinions of the possible damages from climatic change. Our analyses show that incorporating most of these alternate damage estimates into DICE results in a significantly more aggressive optimal policy than that suggested by the original model using a single damage function. In addition, statistical distributions of these damage estimates are constructed and used in a probabilistic analysis of optimal carbon tax rates, resulting in mostly much larger (but occasionally smaller) carbon taxes than those of DICE using point values of damage estimates. In view of the large uncertainties in estimates of climate damages, a probabilistic formulation that links many of the structural and data uncertainties and thus acknowledges the wide range of 'optimal' policies is essential to policy analysis, since point values or 'best guesses' deny policy makers the opportunity to consider low probability, but policy-relevant, outliers.

Since the angular momentum of the atmosphere-earth system is conserved this corresponds to a net loss of angular momentum by the solid earth, therefore decreasing the Earth rotation speed and increasing the length of day (LOD). The AAM rise is significant to the budget of angular momentum of the global atmosphere-earth system; its value in milliseconds/century (ms/cy) is + 0.56 ms/cy, corresponding to one-third of the estimated increase in LOD (+1.7 ms/cy). The major contribution to this secular trend in AAM comes from the equatorial Tropopause. This is consistent with results from a previous study using a simplified aqua-planet model to investigate the AAM variations due to near equatorial warming conditions.

This paper examines the potential impact of full cost pricing on the \"sustainability\" of urban transportation, using Toronto as a case study. The analysis deals with the direct effects on mode choice and vehicle utilization resulting from increased user costs as might be achieved through fuel taxes or road pricing, as well as the indirect, longer term effects on location decisions. To investigate the land-use impacts, population distributions were altered to reflect more compact development and less urban sprawl as a proxy for relocations that might result from an increase in the costs of automobile use. Impacts are presented in terms of changes in total peak period vehicle-kilometres, mode split, and CO", " emissions. Despite several qualifications related to modelling techniques used in the case study, the analysis suggests that, overall, the impacts of large increases in road user costs appear to be less than proponents of full cost pricing would expect.

Two novel absorption refrigeration systems are considered herewith (1) the mixed-solvent electrolytes, and (2) mixtures exhibiting liquid-liquid immiscible phase separations as working fluids. When properly designed, they can avoid the global warming and ozone depletion pitfalls usually associated with the chlorofluorcarbon refrigerants. Electrolytic systems such as water-lithium bromide-ethylene glycol, and ammonia-sodium thiocyanate mixtures can serve as cooling media in an absorption refrigeration cycle with salts as absorbents and water (or ammonia) as refrigerants. The cycle efficiency (expressed in terms of the coefficient of performance-COP) plays a major role in determining their economical viability. In this paper, we study the desirable molecular characteristics that the salt systems should possess in order to yield high COP. We set out to answer the questions: how do we select and screen electrolytic mixtures as working fluids? and what molecular properties impact on design and efficiency? We shall apply an accurate theory, namely, the mean-spherical approach (MSA) to electrolytes to model the activities of the salt solutions. The results are checked with available data to ascertain its accuracy. Predictions can then be made on the performance of electrolytic working fluids in applications such as air-conditioning and refrigeration. Next, for mixtures of chemical solvents that form liquid-liquid immiscibility gaps, a Maxwell cycle can be constructed to generate refrigeration. In order for this class of solvents to work, a number of practical and thermodynamic considerations must be satisfied. We examine several functional criteria that are needed to operate the cycle: the first is concerned with the free energy-of-mixing behavior; the second, the pattern of the immiscibility gaps; and the last, most importantly, the influence of activity coefficients on absorption. This type of refrigeration, not yet commercially developed, promises to be highly economical due to hardware savings (elimination of the condenser), and energy savings (no need to supply the latent heats of evaporation). \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The goal is to lay the groundwork for full-scale, time-resolved Navier-Stokes simulations that allow for the direct description of the non-linear processes limiting the overall efficiency of such devices. The TASHE model adopted for the present study is a double-Helmholtz resonator with the engine module at one end. The latter is composed of an infinitely thin annular tube holding the heat-exchanger/regenerator (HX/REG) unit - the only component not directly resolved. All walls are modeled as adiabatic, no-slip boundaries with a local wall-normal resolution resolving the boundary layer thickness. An imposed temperature difference across the regenerator of \u0394T = 200K is sufficient to initiate the thermoacoustic instability leading to the generation of acoustic energy in the system. After the application of the heat source, the acoustic fluctuations in the engine rapidly settle towards an exponentially amplified pure tone at 59.8 Hz. By tracking a fluid parcel in the regenerator it is shown how the thermoacoustic instability intensifies exclusively plane waves traveling in the direction of the imposed temperature gradient. The Lagrangian thermodynamic history of the fluid parcel resembles a Stirling heat-engine cycle, unveiling the conversion mechanisms of heat into mechanical work central to any TASHE. A well-defined acoustic network of traveling waves looping around the HX/REG unit is established and analyzed with the aid of the time-resolved data. A simple lumped-parameter model is used to investigate the linear stability properties of the initial acoustic perturbation revealing, in particular, that the acoustic energy growth is maximized at the lowest resonant frequencies of the system. Non-linear effects are detectable from the very beginning and become dynamically important only after the first two seconds of operation. It is shown that intense acoustic fluctuations in the feedback loop component drive complex system-wide streaming flow patterns responsible, in particular, for the mean advection of hot fluid away from the HX/REG (thermal leakage) in the direction of the imposed temperature gradient and around the annular tube. This unwanted effect is contained by the introduction of a second ambient heat-exchanger, commonly found in the design of real TASHEs, allowing for the establishment of a dynamical thermal equilibrium in the system.

It was found that the measured weekly average concentrations display strong persistent seasonal variations. Initially the measured concentrations of 24 constituents were arranged into both two-way and three-way data arrays, and bilinear and trilinear models were used to fit the data using positive matrix factorization (PMF). Five factors were found to explain the data quite well for both two-way and three-way modeling, and each factor represented a likely particle source. In the two-way modeling the yearly cyclical seasonal variations were not directly retrieved, since the whole 11 years of data were regarded as a single mode in the fitting. In the three-way analysis, fixed seasonality was imposed by assuming the week-to-week patterns of the source contributions to recur from year to year. The factors represent winter Arctic haze, photochemical sulfate after polar sunrise, biogenic sulfur, soil and sea salt. The resulting fit for some elements became worse because the year-to-year variation is not identical for these sources. These results suggested that a mixed two-way and three-way model might be the best representation of the data. The methodology to calculate such a mixed model has just been developed, namely the multilinear engine (ME). In this study the ME has been used to estimate a mixed two-way/three-way model for the Alert aerosol data. Five two-way and two three-way factors have been found to provide the best fit and interpretation of the data. Each factor represents a probable source with a distinctive compositional profile and seasonal variations. The five two-way factors are (i) winter Arctic haze dominated by SO", " together with metallic species and peaking from December to March, (ii) soil represented by Si, Al and Ca, (iii) sea salt, (iv) sulfate with high acidity peaking in late March/April, and (v) iodine representing most of the observed I with two maxima, one around September/October and the other around March/April. The two three-way factors are (i) bromine characterized by a maximum in the spring around March/April, and (ii) biogenic sulfur which includes sulfate and methane sulfonate (MSA) with maxima in May and August. The results obtained are consistent with those obtained in the previous study and agree with the current understanding of the Arctic aerosol. In both analyses the year-to-year strength of the biogenic factor appears to correlate strongly with the average temperature in the northern hemisphere. This result suggests that as the temperature rises, there is increased biogenic production of the reduced sulfur precursor compounds that are oxidized in the atmosphere to sulfate and MSA and could be evidence of a negative feedback mechanism in the global climate system that had been previously postulated.

Here we use atmospheric circulation data from the Northern Hemisphere to show that recent climate change can be interpreted in terms of changes in the frequency of occurrence of natural atmospheric circulation regimes. We conclude that recent Northern Hemisphere warming may be more directly related to the thermal structure of these circulation regimes than to any anthropogenic forcing pattern itself. Conversely, the fact that observed climate change projects onto natural patterns cannot be used as evidence of no anthropogenic effect on climate.

The initial conditions are made progressively colder, with more extensive sea-ice cover in the northern North Atlantic. The key result is that starting from conditions which are too cold in the North Atlantic and with sea-ice that is too extensive leads to an MOC that is more stable to the radiative forcing. Furthermore, under considerably underestimated sea surface temperatures in subpolar regions, the MOC can even intensify. A reduction of freshwater flux associated with the reduction of sea-ice melt is shown to be important for such unusual behavior of the MOC.

In this study, June and January climates, in which typical precipitation phenomena in Japan such as \"bai-u\" and winter snow are observed, are simulated using the model with lateral resolutions of 50 km (Base case) and 25 km (High case). The resolution effects of the model are also examined using a series of sensitivity studies. The main results are as follows: (1) In June and January, while cyclones passing over the inner region tend to be more intensified in the model (sometimes unrealistically) than those observed, weak cyclones in the outer region are usually not well simulated in the model. This seems to be due to the stronger control by the lateral boundary conditions. Anticyclones are stronger in the simulation than those observed, especially in the inner region, which leads to overestimation of the sea level pressure there. (2) The model yielded a lower surface air temperature than that observed, especially in January, which may depend on the performance of BATS or the radiative transfer scheme. (3) The model tends to overestimate the regional mean precipitation in the inner region and underestimate it in the outer region in June, while it was slightly underestimated in the inner and outer regions in January. Overestimations are caused by overdeveloped simulated cyclones or by the large amount of precipitation on the unrealistic topography such as a steep slope facing a moist tongue. Underestimation is due to stronger control by the lateral boundary conditions that prevent the development of cyclones or fronts. (4) In the high-resolution models, weak cyclones in the outer region and anticyclones in the inner region are more realistically simulated, although they do not greatly improve the model results in the Base case. Precipitation is increased by \u223c10-15% of that in the Base case in the inner region in June and January due to enhancement of cyclones or fronts, where the high-resolution effect of topography is only \u223c1/5 of the total high-resolution effect of the model in June. In January, for northwestern Japan, high model resolution contributes to the correction (increase) of precipitation there. Generally, the high-resolution effect of the model on the surface air temperature does not systematically improve the results but does vary locally by the improvement of model topography. To improve the model results, the lateral boundary should be moved outward (the domain of the model should be extended to the west and south) and/or the precipitation scheme should be improved, including the adjustment of parameters. BATS or the radiative transfer scheme should be improved. More recommendations for the improvement of the model are proposed.

With a conventional parallel plate radio frequency (rf) plasma reactor, the PFC gas utilization is incomplete and a large fraction of unreacted gas can be emitted in the atmosphere.

Seven sedimentary regimes are identified, but there are more extensive descriptions of the late Cenozoic regimes because of the larger data base. The regimes of the Mesozoic passive margin include carbonate platforms, which become mixed calcareous-terrigenous deposits during the Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary. The Oligocene and Early Miocene terrigenous regimes developed, in contrast, over the active and transcurrent margins near the African-Iberian plate boundary. The top of the Gulf of Cadiz olistostrome, emplaced in the Late Miocene, is used as a key horizon to define the 'post-orogenic' depositional regimes. The Late Miocene progradational margin regime is characterized by a large terrigenous sediment supply to the margin and coincides with the closing of the Miocene Atlantic-Mediterranean gateways. The terrigenous drift depositional regime of the Early Pliocene resulted from the occurrence of high eustatic sea level and the characteristics of the Mediterranean outflow currents that developed after the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar. The Late Pliocene and Quaternary regimes are dominated by sequences of deposits related to cycles of high and low sea levels. Deposition of shelf-margin deltas and slope wedges correlate with regressive and low sea level regimes caused by eustasy and subsidence. During the highstand regimes of the Holocene, inner shelf prograding deltas and deep-water sediment drifts were developed under the influence of the Atlantic inflow and Mediterranean outflow currents, respectively. A modern human cultural regime began 2000 years ago with the Roman occupation of Iberia; human cultural effects on sedimentary regimes may have equalled natural factors such as climate change. Interplay of tectonic and oceanographic controls dominated the evolution of the Cadiz margin during the Cenozoic. Depositional sequences formed where the tectonic setting provided the accommodation space and the shape of the deposits has been greatly influenced by the strong unidirectional Atlantic inflow currents on the shelf and Mediterranean outflow currents on the slope. The entire cycle of the inflow and outflow deposition along the margin has been controlled first by the tectonic evolution of the Betic and Rif gateways, which become closed during the Late Miocene, and after the Messinian by the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar. Strong current development during eustatic sea level highstands of the Pliocene and Quaternary has controlled deposition because of maximum sill depths at Gibraltar for water circulation. Lowstand sea levels slowed circulation and resulted in mud drapes over the slope and regressive stratigraphic sequences over the shelf. More recently, the human industrial revolution has caused heavy metal contamination of sediment and water over the Cadiz margin. Human activity also has affected sedimentation rates because of deforestation that caused increased depositional rates near undammed rivers and decreased rates where rivers have been dammed. Future research efforts will need to focus on: (1) the effect of increased Mediterranean outflow caused by river damming plus global warming and the increased outflow as a potential trigger for new ice ages; (2) assessments of geologic hazards for planning man-made shoreline structures, developing offshore petroleum resources and maintaining undersea communications cables; and (3) confirmation of the general geologic history of the Cadiz margin."], "title": "Interaction of tectonic and depositional processes that control the evolution of the Iberian Gulf of Cadiz margin"},

During a strong drought year (1994), heating altered the timing, but did not significantly alter the cumulative magnitude, of net carbon uptake in the dry zone.

When differences were detected in dry-zone carbon fluxes, they were caused by changes in carbon input from photosynthesis, not by a temperature-driven changes in carbon output from soil respiration. Regression analysis suggested that the reduction in carbon inputs from plants was due to a combination of two soil moisture effects: a direct physiological response to decreased soil moisture, and a shift in plant community composition from high-productivity species to low-productivity species that are more drought tolerant. These results partially support predictions that warming may cause net carbon losses from some terrestrial ecosystems.

Resource depletion, global warming, acidification, eutrophication and air pollution have been considered as impact categories. The main results of this study are summarized as follows, (1) The impacts of eutrophication, air pollution and resource depletion are serious for the production of aluminum. (2) The stages of the consumption of non oil and that of the production of non oil are serious for the production of zinc, because the large quantity of non oil such as cokes are consumed. (3) We have showed that the interpretation will differ if the criteria of materials for assessment are changed from weight (per kg) to tensile strength (per MN)."], "title": "Application of life cycle assessment to manufacturing of nonferrous metals"},

A popular approach to quantify the potential to abate national agricultural emissions is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines for national GHG inventories (IPCC-NI method). This methodology is the standard for assessing compliance with binding national GHG reduction targets and uses a sector based framework to attribute emissions. There is however an alternative to the IPCC-NI method, known as life cycle assessment (LCA), which is the preferred method to assess the GHG intensity of food production (kg of GHG/unit of food). The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of using the IPCC-NI and LCA methodologies when completing a MACC analysis of national agricultural GHG emissions. The MACC was applied to the Irish agricultural sector and mitigation measures were only constrained by the biophysical environment. The reference scenario chosen assumed that the 2020 growth targets set by the Irish agricultural industry would be achieved. The comparison of methodologies showed that only 1.1 Mt of the annual GHG abatement potential that can be achieved at zero or negative cost could be attributed to agricultural sector using the IPCC-NI method, which was only 44% of the zero or negative cost abatement potential attributed to the sector using the LCA method. The difference between methodologies was because the IPCC-NI method attributes the abatement from agricultural mitigation measures, partially or fully, to other sectors within a nation or to activity taking place in other countries. This suggests that it may be politically difficult to justify to farmers that mitigation measures should be adopted in agriculture, if the accounting process does not credit this mitigation to them. The disagreement between methodologies also indicates that unilateral national or regional policies to reduce agricultural GHG emissions based on the IPCC-NI method could lead to mitigation options that increase global emissions (carbon leakage).

Brazil has a special place in strategies for combating global warming because its vast areas of tropical forest represent a potentially large source of emissions if deforested. A number of issues need to be settled to properly assign credit for carbon in the types of options presented by the Brazilian forest sector. These include definition of the units of carbon (permanent sequestration versus carbon-ton-years, the latter being most appropriate for forest options), the means of crediting forest reserve establishment, adoption of discounting or other time-preference weighting for carbon, definition of the accounting method (avoided emissions versus stock maintenance), and mechanisms to allow program contributions to be counted, rather than restricting consideration to free-standing projects. Silvicultural plantations offer opportunities for carbon benefits, but these depend heavily on the end use of the products. Plantations for charcoal have the greatest carbon benefits, but have high social impacts in the Brazilian context. Plantations also inherently compete with deforestation reduction options for funds. Forest management has been proposed as a global warming response option, but the assignment of any value to time makes this unattractive in terms of carbon benefits. However, reduced-impact logging can substantially reduce emissions over those from traditional logging practices. Slowing deforestation is the major opportunity offered by Brazil. Slowing deforestation will require understanding its causes and creating functional models capable of generating land-use change scenarios with and without different policy changes and other activities. Brazil already has a number of programs designed to slow deforestation, but the continued rapid loss of forest highlights the vast gulf that exists between the magnitude of the problem and the efforts to address it.

It displays substantial interannual variability in intensity which may have important implications for the predictability of the coupled system. The reasons for this interannual variability are not understood. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the interannual behavior of the MJO is related to tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, particularly El Nino, and hence whether it is predictable. The interannual behavior of the MJO has been diagnosed initially in the 40-year National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis. The results suggest that prior to the mid-1970s the activity of the MJO was consistently lower than during the latter part of the record. This may be related either to inadequacies in the data coverage, particularly over the tropical Indian Ocean prior to the introduction of satellite observations, or to the real effects of a decadal time-scale warming in the tropical SSTs. The teleconnection patterns between interannual variations in MJO activity and SST show only a weak, barely significant, influence of El Nino in which the MJO is more active during the cold phase. As well as the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, a 4-member ensemble of 45-year integrations with the Hadley Centre climate model (HadAM2a), forced by observed SSTs for 1949-93, has been used to investigate the relationship between MJO activity and SST. HadAM2a is known to give a reasonable simulation of the MJO, and the extended record provided by this ensemble of integrations allows a more robust investigation of the predictability of MJO activity than was possible with the 40-year NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. The results have shown that, for the uncoupled system, with the atmosphere being driven by imposed SSTs, there is no reproducibility of the activity of the MJO from year-to-year. The interannual behaviour of the MJO is not controlled by the phase of El Nino and would appear to be mainly chaotic in character. However, the model results have confirmed the low-frequency, decadal time-scale variability of MJO activity seen in the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. The activity of the MJO is consistently lower in all realizations prior to the mid-1970s, suggesting that the MJO may become more active as tropical SSTs increase. This result may have implications for the effects of global warming on the coupled tropical atmosphere-ocean system. Since the observed and simulated MJOs display clear seasonality in their occurence, the relationship with interannual changes in the mean seasonal cycle of the tropical circulation as also been investigated. In contrast to the MJO, the interannual variability in the mean seasonal cycle is reproducible and influenced by the phase of El Nino. The implications of these results for the predictability of the tropical atmosphere-ocean system are discussed, particularly with reference to the strong El Nino event of 1997 which developed in association with a period of intense MJO activity."], "title": "On the predictability of the interannual behaviour of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and its relationship with El Nino"},

Its natural resources spurred strategic geopolitical developments beginning in the 16th century but intense development of the boreal forest is largely limited to the 20th century. Insects cause considerable loss of wood that has an adverse effect on the balance of carbon sequestered by forests. Current understanding of processes that lead to stand-replacing outbreaks in three insect species is reviewed in this paper. Many of these processes depend on climate either directly, such as reduced survival with extreme weather events, or indirectly, mainly through effects on the host trees. In the boreal zone of Canada, pest-caused timber losses may be as much as 1.3-2.0 times the mean annual depletions due to fires. Pests are thus major, but consistently overlooked forest ecosystem components that have manifold consequences to the structure and functions of future forests. Global change will have demonstrable changes in the frequency and intensity of pest outbreaks, particularly at the margins of host ranges. The consequent shunting of carbon back to the atmosphere rather than to sequestration in forests as biomass is thought to have positive feedback to global warming. Whereas significant progress has been made in developing carbon budget models for the boreal forests of Canada, enormous problems remain in incorporating pest effects in these models. These problems have their origins in the nature of interactions among pests with forest productivity, and problems with scaling. The common problems of verification and validation of model results are particularly troublesome in projecting future forest productivity. The interaction of insects with fires must be accounted for if realistic carbon sequestration forecasts in a warming climate are to be made. These problems make assessments of mitigation and adaptation of pest management alternatives difficult to evaluate at present. Nevertheless, the impacts of stand-replacing insect population outbreaks is important in formulating future resource management policy.

Changes in plant community productivity or composition, for example, may alter ecosystem resource dynamics, trophic structures, or disturbance regimes, with subsequent positive or negative feedbacks on the plant community. At northern latitudes, where increases in temperature are expected to be greatest but where plant species diversity is relatively low, climatically mediated changes in species composition or abundance will likely have large ecosystem effects. In this study, we investigated effects of infrared loading and manipulations of water-table elevation on net primary productivity of plant species in bog and fen wetland mesocosms between 1994 and 1997. We removed 27 intact soil monoliths (2.1 m", " surface area, 0.5-0.7 m depth) each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water-table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Overhead infrared lamps caused mean monthly soil temperatures to increase by 1.6-4.1\u00b0C at 15-cm depth during the growing season (May-October). In 1996, depths to water table averaged -11, -19, and -26 cm in the bog plots, and 0, -10, and -19 cm in the fen plots. Annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of bryophyte, forb, graminoid, and shrub life-forms was determined for the dominant species in the mesocosm plots based on species-specific canopy/biomass relationships. Belowground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated using root in-growth cores. Bog and fen communities differed in their response to infrared loading and water-table treatments because of the differential response of life-forms and species characteristic of each community. Along a gradient of increasing water-table elevation, production of bryophytes increased, and production of shrubs decreased in the bog community. Along a similar gradient in the fen community, production of graminoids and forbs increased. Along a gradient of increasing infrared loading in the bog, shrub production increased whereas graminoid production decreased. In the fen, graminoids were most productive at high infrared loading, and forbs were most productive at medium infrared loading. In the bog and fen, BNPP:ANPP ratios increased with warming and drying, indicating shifts in carbon allocation in response to climate change. Further, opposing responses of species and life-forms tended to cancel out the response of production at higher levels of organization, especially in the bog. For example, total net primary productivity in the bog did not differ between water-table treatments because BNPP was greatest in the dry treatment whereas ANPP was greatest in the wet treatment. The differential responses of species, life-forms, and above- and belowground biomass production to the treatments suggest that bog and fen plant communities will change, in different directions and magnitudes, in response to warming and changes in water-table elevation. Further, results of this and complementary research indicate that these peatlands may mediate their energy, carbon, and nutrient budgets through differential responses of the plant communities. Thus, predictions of the response of peatlands to changes in climate should consider differences in plant community structure, as well as biogeochemistry and hydrology, that characterize and differentiate these two ecosystems."], "title": "Response of bog and fen plant communities to warming and water-table manipulations"},

Two or more series may share a common stochastic trend, which indicates that either one series causes the behavior of the other or that there is a common driving variable. Recent developments in econometrics allow analysts to detect and classify such trends and analyze relationships among series that contain stochastic trends. We apply some univariate autoregression based tests to evaluate the presence of stochastic trends in several time series for temperature and radiative forcing. The temperature and radiative forcing series are found to be of different orders of integration which would cast doubt on the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis. However, these tests can suffer from size distortions when applied to noisy series such as hemispheric temperatures. We, therefore, use multivariate structural time series techniques to decompose Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperatures into stochastic trends and autoregressive noise processes. These results show that there are two independent stochastic trends in the data. We investigate the possible origins of these trends using a regression method. Radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases and solar irradiance can largely explain the common trend. The second trend, which represents the non-scalar non-stationary differences between the hemispheres, reflects radiative forcing due to tropospheric sulfate aerosols. We find similar results when we use the same techniques to analyze temperature data generated by the Hadley Centre GCM SUL experiment."], "title": "Detecting a global warming signal in hemispheric temperature series: A structural time series analysis"},

The results indicated that the regionally averaged trends in temperature extremes were consistent with global warming. The occurrence of warm extremes, including summer days (SU), tropical nights (TR), warm days (TX90), and nights (TN90) and a warm spell duration indicator (WSDI), increased by 2.76 (P< 0.01), 1.24 (P< 0.01), 2.60 (P = 0.0003), 3.41 (P< 0.01), and 0.68 (P = 0.0041) days/decade during the period of 1960-2013, particularly, sharp increases in these indices occurred in 1985-2000. Over the same period, the occurrence of cold extremes, including frost days (FD), ice days (ID), cold days (TX10) and nights (TN10), and a cold spell duration indicator (CSDI) exhibited decreases of - 3.22 (P< 0.01), - 2.21 (P = 0.0028), - 2.71 (P = 0 .0028), - 4.31 (P< 0.01), and - 0.69 (P = 0.0951) days/decade, respectively.

Isolated Fagus (beech) populations have been recorded in less than 10 small areas (2-40 ha) in the eastern Sierra Madre at altitudes from 1400 to 2000 m. The objectives were to determine tree and seedling age, forest structure, phenology, litterfall patterns and the relationship between mast and climatic variables. Location We report on three Fagus stands at the Acatlan Volcano, Veracruz, Mexico. Methods Changes in forest cover were determined using aerial photographs. Within each stand, basal area, density and tree species composition were determined in a 0.1-ha band transect. Additionally, litterfall production was quantified and phenophases were recorded monthly over a 3-year period, and 60 tree cores were collected to determine age distribution and tree-ring growth. Results The forest was atypical in several respects. Fagus was the only dominant tree species in the crater stand, although in the rim and at the top of the volcano it was codominant with other tree species. Juveniles occurred only on the rim, but there was a seedling bank in the crater. Although forest cover in the area increased between 1968 and 1993, the Fagus stands did not change in size. Leaf production peaked in March and April, and leaf fall occurred from October through February. Litterfall production was the highest in November. During mast years, flowering started in February and between mast events there were no flowers or fruits. Minimum temperatures were highly correlated with Fagus litterfall and leaf fall. Seedlings ranged in age from 2 to 18 years and were 13-60 cm tall. Tree cores ranged from 76 to 120 years, but trees were older than the core samples. Main conclusions Although beech is considered a gap regeneration species that reaches the canopy after alternating periods of release and suppression, the trees in the crater were released when less than 1.5 m tall and have suffered few periods of suppression since. The results indicate that the crater stand was established after a severe disturbance destroyed the existing forest. We conclude that the relict beech population should be able to maintain itself, if not severely disturbed by humans or by climatic changes related to global warming."], "title": "A relict population of Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana at the Acatlan Volcano, Mexico: Structure, litterfall, phenology and dendroecology"},

The relationship between the increasing urban runoff and flooding due to increased imperviousness is better perceived than that between the cyclic impact of urban growth and the urban rainfall via microclimatic changes. The large-scale, global impacts due to climate variability and change could compound these risks. We present the case of a typical third world city - Can Tho (the biggest city in Mekong River Delta, Vietnam) - faced with multiple future challenges, namely: (i) the likely effect of climate change-driven sea level rise, (ii) an expected increase of river runoff due to climate change as estimated by the Vietnamese government, (iii) increased urban runoff driven by imperviousness, and (iv) enhancement of extreme rainfall due to urban growth-driven, microclimatic change (urban heat islands). A set of model simulations were used to construct future scenarios, combining these influences. Urban growth of the city was projected up to year 2100 based on historical growth patterns, using a land use simulation model (Dinamica EGO). A dynamic limited-area atmospheric model (WRF), coupled with a detailed land surface model with vegetation parameterization (Noah LSM), was employed in controlled numerical experiments to estimate the anticipated changes in extreme rainfall patterns due to urban heat island effect. Finally, a 1-D/2-D coupled urban-drainage/flooding model (SWMM-Brezo) was used to simulate storm-sewer surcharge and surface inundation to establish the increase in the flood hazard resulting from the changes. The results show that under the combined scenario of significant change in river level (due to climate-driven sea level rise and increase of flow in the Mekong) and \"business as usual\" urbanization, the flooding of Can Tho could increase significantly. The worst case may occur if a sea level rise of 100 cm and the flow from upstream happen together with high-development scenarios. The relative contribution of causes of flooding are significantly different at various locations; therefore, detailed research on adaptation are necessary for future investments to be effective. \u00a9 Author(s) 2013."], "title": "Urbanization and climate change impacts on future urban flooding in Can Tho city, Vietnam"},

According to previous field studies in the biomanipulated Bautzen reservoir (Germany), a midsummer decline of the dominating zooplankter, Daphnia galeata, was suggested to be initiated by a simultaneous occurrence of low fecundity of the daphnids and a selective feeding of underyearling fish on mature daphnids. The timing of both processes was assumed to be triggered by spring water temperature. However, the field data were not appropriate for testing whether yearly differences in spring warming are strong enough to control the predation rate of underyearling fish on daphnids. 2. By combining field data on fish growth, feeding and population mortality, the daily uptake of Daphnia by a virtual population of underyearling perch (Perca fluviatilis) was simulated. In addition, the daily predatory mortality of mature daphnids was calculated independently. Scenarios with a warm and a cold spring were compared. Furthermore, the delayed warming of a pelagic zone of a lake versus a littoral one was simulated. Sensitivity of the simulation to changes in five parameters was tested. 3. In both the warm spring scenario and the littoral warming scenario, more daphnids in general and more mature daphnids in particular were eaten, compared with the cold spring and pelagic scenarios. The predatory mortality of mature daphnids was driven by the increasing gape size of growing fish such that in warmer years the fish reach earlier the size at which they can eat mature daphnids. 4. The simulation was most sensitive to changes in daily mortality rate of the fish and to the size at maturity of the daphnids. Since at least the fish mortality is also temperature-dependent via the growth rates of fish, the predation rate of perch on D. galeata in Bautzen reservoir is substantially increased during a warm spring.

The southerlies are minimal during boreal spring, when two precipitation maxima straddle the equator. Fourteen atmosphere-ocean coupled GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) and one coupled regional model are evaluated against observations with simple metrics that diagnose the seasonal cycle and meridional migration of warm SST and rain. Intermodel correlations of the metrics elucidate common coupled physics. These models variously simulate the climatology of SST and ITCZ rain. In 8 out of 15 models the ITCZ alternates symmetrically between the hemispheres with the seasons. This seasonally alternating ITCZ error generates two wind speed maxima per year - one northerly and one southerly - resulting in spurious cooling in March and a cool SST error of the equatorial ocean. Most models have too much rain in the Southern Hemisphere so that SST and rain are too symmetric about the equator in the annual mean. Weak meridional wind on the equator near the South American coast (2\u00b0S-2\u00b0N, 80\u00b0-90\u00b0W) explains the warm SST error there. Northeasterly wind jets blow over the Central American isthmus in winter and cool the SST in the eastern Pacific warm pool. In some models the strength of these winds contributes to the early demise of their northern ITCZ relative to observations. The February-April northerly wind bias on the equator is correlated to the antecedent December-February Central American Pacific wind speed at -0.88. The representation of southern-tropical stratus clouds affects the underlying SST through solar radiation, but its effect on the meridional atmospheric circulation is difficult to discern from the multimodel ensemble, indicating that errors other than the simulation of stratus clouds are also important for accurate simulation of the meridional asymmetry. This study identifies several features to be improved in atmospheric and coupled GCMs, including the northeasterly cross-Central American wind in winter and meridional wind on the equator. Improved simulation of the seasonal cycle of meridional wind could alleviate biases in equatorial SST and improve simulation of ENSO and its teleconnections. \u00a9 2008 American Meteorological Society."], "title": "The tropical eastern pacific seasonal cycle: Assessment of errors and mechanisms in IPCC AR4 coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models"},

Results: Mortality was lowest at 14.3-17.3\u00b0C in north Finland but at 22.7-25.7\u00b0C in Athens. Overall the 3\u00b0C minimum mortality temperature bands were significantly higher in regions with higher than lower mean summer temperatures (P = 0.027). This was not due to regional differences in wind speeds, humidity, or rain. As a result, regions with hot summers did not have significantly higher annual heat related mortality per million population than cold regions at temperatures above these bands. Mean annual heat related mortalities were 304 (95% confidence interval 126 to 482) in North Finland, 445 (59 to 831) in Athens, and 40 (13 to 68) in London.

To accommodate the full range of constraints, the present-day distribution of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEv) was matched statistically to current climatic variables, to provide a multivariate description of present-day areas of disease risk. This was then applied to outputs of a general circulation model that predicts how climatic variables may change in the future, and future distributions of TBEv were predicted for them. The expected summer rise in temperature and decrease in moisture appears to drive the distribution of TBEv into higher-latitude and higher-altitude regions progressively through the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. The final toe-hold in the 2080s may be confined to a small part of Scandinavia, including new foci in southern Finland. The reason for this apparent contraction of the range of TBEv is that its transmission cycles depend on a particular pattern of tick seasonal dynamics, which may be disrupted by climate change.

The environmental impact improvements of the new model compared to the old are approximately 10%, and the uncertainty of the results is judged to be smaller than the difference between the systems. The use stage and the manufacturing stage give the largest impacts, both for the new and the old model. In the manufacturing stage, the hardware production clearly dominates. EE's organisation is secondly most important and hardware transport is least important. This is due to more environmental load from service and business travelling in the organisation than environmental load arising from the distribution of the product.

The model, a stochastic dynamic program, is used to optimize the timing and type of protective structure under a range of management goals.

Annual precipitation, annual temperature, and July and January temperatures were reconstructed by comparing fossil pollen in lake sediment with pollen in surface samples, assuming that ancient climates were similar to modern climate near analogous surface samples. In the early Holocene, most of the parks experienced colder winters, warmer summers, and lower precipitation than today. An exception is Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota where, by 8000 years ago, January temperatures were higher than today. The combination of high mean annual temperature and lower precipitation at Voyageurs resulted in a dry period between 8000 and 5000 years ago, similar to the Prairie Period in regions to the south and west. A mid-Holocene warm-dry period also occurred at other northern and central parks but was much less strongly developed. In southern parks there was no clear evidence of a mid-Holocene warm-dry period. These differences suggest that global model predictions of a warm, dry climate in the northern Great Plains under doubled atmospheric CO", " may be more applicable to Voyageurs than to the other parks. The contrast in reconstructed temperatures at Voyageurs and Isle Royale indicates that the ameliorating effect of the Great Lakes on temperatures has been in effect throughout the Holocene and presumably will continue in the future, thus reducing the potential for species loss caused by future temperature extremes. Increased numbers of mesic trees at all of the parks in the late Holocene reflect increasing annual precipitation. This trend toward more mesic conditions began 6000 years ago in the south and 4000 years ago in the north and increased sharply in recent millennia at parks located today in lake-effect snow belts.

Projected ranges of uncertainty can have probabilities attached to the range and within the range, so are more likely to occur than individual scenarios. However, as there is significant remaining uncertainty beyond the projected range, such projections cannot be regarded as forecasts. An appropriate terminology is required to communicate this distinction. The sources of uncertainty in projected ranges of global temperature to 2100 are analysed by Visser et al.

A wide range of examples of applications of meteorological data to aquaculture and inland fisheries are provided. They include continental assessments of inland fish farming potential, fishery potential in small water bodies, synoptic loss of fishery potential due to environmental degradation, complex effects of wind on fish production in a large lake and effects of global warming on fish distribution and production. It is concluded that the meteorological data that serve for agriculture also are relevant for inland fisheries and aquaculture, although the relative importance of parameters and their temporal aptness may be different, and thresholds may be dissimilar. Similarly, if the timeliness, resolution and predictive capabilities for agrometeorological data can be improved, there would be considerable benefits to inland fisheries and aquaculture.

Here we report on vegetation responses to experimental warming in a subalpine meadow in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. We found no evidence that the plant community changed during four years of warming. Species composition in warmed plots did not change more through time than in control plots, nor did warmed plots diverge from adjacent control plots through time. Contrary to an earlier report, we found no evidence that warming facilitated adults or seedlings of sagebrush, a shrub characteristic of lower elevation ecosystems; nor did it facilitate short-lived plant species as a group. Total vegetation cover, as well as cover of graminoids, forbs, and shrubs, did not differ between control and warmed plots, nor did species richness or species' distributions along a small elevational gradient within each plot. Shrub cover tended to increase more, and forb cover to decrease more, in warmed than in control plots during one summer season, but not significantly so. This lack of detectable plant community response contrasts with pronounced responses to warming in some arctic and alpine ecosystems over similar time spans. Warming in these ecosystems is thought to act indirectly via increased mobilization of soil nutrients. One possible reason for the lack of response in our system is that drying of soil limits microbial activity, photosynthesis, and plant growth sooner in the season in warmed plots, canceling out effects of earlier snowmelt.

Agricultural emissions of methane in the EU-15 have recently been estimated at 10.2 million tonnes per year and represent the greatest source. Of these, approximately two-thirds come from enteric fermentation and one-third from livestock manure. Fermentation of feeds in the rumen is the largest source of methane from enteric fermentation and this paper considers in detail the reasons for, and the consequences of, the fact that the molar percentage of the different volatile fatty acids produced during fermentation influences the production of methane in the rumen. Acetate and butyrate promote methane production while propionate formation can be considered as a competitive pathway for hydrogen use in the rumen. The many alternative approaches to reducing methane are considered, both in terms of reduction per animal and reduction per unit of animal product. It was concluded that the most promising areas for future research for reducing methanogenesis are the development of new products/delivery systems for anti-methanogenic compounds or alternative electron acceptors in the rumen and reduction in protozoal numbers in the rumen.

An inoculum consisting of twelve European isolates of C. beticola Sacc. was used in the experiments. One Cercospora-sensitive and one Cercospora-tolerant sugarbeet line were analysed from growth regimes where plants were grown either under visible radiation alone or with supplemental UV-B. Photosynthetic pigments and partial reactions of photosynthesis, including potential yield and quantum yield under illumination, non-photochemical quenching (q(NPQ)) and photochemical quenching (q(p)), were measured to assess plant response. The combination of Cercospora and supplemental UV-B radiation in the sensitive line resulted in a decreased photosynthetic efficiency, shown by q(NPQ) and quantum yield under illumination as compared with that for either stress applied alone. The F(v)/F(m) was unchanged for plants subjected to UV-B radiation without infection, although the q(NPQ) decreased.

Methods: This investigation was carried out by constructing networks of carbon exchange between the living and nonliving components that comprise this ecosystem. By means of these networks potential for carbon accumulation has been assessed by identifying and quantifying pathways for the transfer of carbon, assessing the efficiency between trophic levels, and evaluating the importance of material cycling. These analyses are commonly referred to as network analysis. Results: Results obtained show that dependency on detritus by higher trophic levels is rather low and so is the trophic efficiency. Yet, less than 10% of the carbon that flows through the system is recycled and the magnitude of internal ascendency reaches only 40% of the total system ascendency.

Considerable year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10-yr study (1983-1992), with most extreme hot-dry conditions in 1988 during a 3-yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age-0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age-0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding on invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no-chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot-dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size-structured trophic interactions between age-0 fish along lake-stream gradients. Hot-dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species. The response of fish to climatic variation appears to be strongly influenced by their position in the 'hydrologic landscape.'

It is well recognized, however, that these chemicals have had important uses to society, particularly as refrigerants, as solvents, as plastic blowing agents, as fire retardants and as aerosol propellants. This has led to an extensive search for substitute chemicals with appropriate properties to be used in place of the CFCs and halons. The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a consistent manner the atmospheric lifetime and radiative forcing on climate for a number of replacement compounds. The unique aspect of this study is its attempt to resolve inconsistencies in previous evaluations of atmospheric lifetimes and radiative forcings for these compounds by adopting a uniform approach. Using the latest version of our two-dimensional chemical-radiative-transport model of the global atmosphere, we have determined the atmospheric lifetimes of 28 hydrohalocarbons (HCFCs and HFCs). Through the comparison of the model-calculated lifetimes with lifetimes derived using a simple scaling method, our study adds to earlier findings that consideration of stratospheric losses is important in determining the lifetimes of gases. Discrepancies were found in the reported lifetimes of several replacement compounds reported in the international assessment of stratospheric ozone published by the World Meteorological Organization [Granier et al., 1999] and have been resolved. We have also derived the adjusted and instantaneous radiative forcings for CFC-11 and 20 other halocarbons using our radiative transfer model. The sensitivity of radiative forcings to the vertical distribution of these gases is investigated in this study and is shown to be significant. The difference in the global radiative forcing arising from the assumption of a constant vertical profile for these gases is found to range from O to 36%, with higher difference for short-lived gases. Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for the compounds are determined using the lifetimes and radiative forcings evaluated in this study and are found to differ from values reported by Granier et al.

Without external forcing, the experiment with water vapor feedback produces 44% more annual-mean, global-mean precipitation variability than the one without. We diagnose the reason for this difference: In both experiments, global-mean surface temperature anomalies are associated with water vapor anomalies. However, when water vapor interacts with longwave radiation, the temperature anomalies are associated with larger anomalies in surface downward longwave radiation. This increases the temperature anomaly damping through latent heat flux, creating an evaporation anomaly. The evaporation anomaly, in turn, leads to an anomaly of nearly the same magnitude in precipitation. In the experiment without water vapor feedback, this mechanism is absent. While the interaction between longwave and water vapor has a large impact on the global hydrologic cycle internal variations, its effect decreases as spatial scales decrease, so water vapor feedback has only a very small impact on grid-scale hydrologic variability. Water vapor feedback also affects the hydrologic cycle intensification when greenhouse gas concentrations increase. By the 5th century of global warming experiments where CO", " is increased and then fixed at its doubled value, the global-mean precipitation increase is nearly an order of magnitude larger when water vapor feedback is present. The cause of this difference is similar to the cause of the difference in internal precipitation variability: When water vapor feedback is present, the increase in water vapor associated with a warmer climate enhances downward longwave radiation. To maintain surface heat balance, evaporation increases, leading to a similar increase in precipitation. This effect is absent in the experiment without water vapor feedback. The large impact of water vapor feedback on hydrologic cycle intensification does not weaken as spatial scales decrease, unlike the internal variability case. Accurate representations of water vapor feedback are therefore necessary to simulate global-scale hydrologic variability and intensification of the hydrologic cycle in global warming.

Because the coastal zone is smaller in volume and areal coverage relative to the open ocean, it traditionally has been studied as an integral part of the global oceans. In this paper, we show by numerical modeling that it is important to consider the coastal zone as an entity separate from the open ocean in any assessment of future Earth-system response under human perturbation. Model analyses for the early part of the 21st century suggest that the coastal zone plays a significant modifying role in the biogeochemical dynamics of the carbon cycle and the nutrient cycles coupled to it. This role is manifested in changes in primary production, storage, and/or export of organic matter, its remineralization, and calcium carbonate precipitation-all of which determine the state of the coastal zone with respect to exchange of CO", " with the atmosphere.

The UN International Panel on Climate Change (the UN science advisor) in its 1997 report to the Kyoto parties pointed out the confusing difference between scientific usage of the term 'climate change' that distinguishes human from natural causes of change and the official usage that combines natural and human causes of changes in climate. The conclusion of the UN panel on human causes is equivocal. The 1999 report of the U.S. Global Science Research Committee also reached an equivocal conclusion on human causes and announced a 10-year research program to be developed in consultation with NAS. The precautionary measures provided in the 1992 UN Framework Convention differ from the ill-defined 'precautionary principle' based on fear of uncertainty, and are consistent with the objectives of the NAS proposed research program. These developments together with the third report of the UN Intergovernmental Science Panel on developments in climate science due in 2001 merit consideration by the convention of the parties under the Kyoto Protocol.

Also their response time is longer. As time progresses after a mass-balance perturbation, the longer response time for continental glaciers compared to glaciers with larger mass turnover offsets the effect of their smaller static sensitivity.

This has been demonstrated unequivocally by paleobotanical data for temperate latitudes. In the far richer vegetations of the tropics species populations also fluctuated independently in response to climatic forcing, from their longlasting glacial states to the patterns of brief interglacials like the present and back again. We use pollen data to reconstruct the vegetation of the Amazon basin in oxygen isotope stages 3 and 2 of the last glaciation in order to measure how the plant populations of the Amazon responded to the global warming at the onset of the Holocene. We find that plant communities of the neotropics vent copious pollen to lake sediments and that this pollen yields powerful signals for community composition. Three continuous sedimentary records reaching through oxygen isotope stage 2 are available from the Amazon lowlands, those from Carajas, Lake Pata and marine deposits off the mouth of the Amazon River. All three records yield pollen histories of remarkable constancy and stability. By comparing them with deposits of equal antiquity from the cerrado (savanna) of central Brazil, we show that most of the Amazon lowlands remained under forest throughout a glacial cycle. This forest was never fragmented by open vegetation as postulated by the refugia hypothesis. Instead the intact forest of glacial times included significant populations of plants that are now montane, suggesting that the global warming of the early Holocene resulted in the expulsion of heat intolerant plants from the lowland forest. Pollen data from the Amazonian flank of the Andes and from Pacific Panama provide evidence that populations of these heat intolerant plants survive the heat of interglacials in part by maintaining large populations at cooler montane altitudes. Our conclusion that the Amazon lowlands were forested in glacial times specifically refutes the hypothesis of Amazonian glacial aridity. Accordingly we examine the geomorphological evidence for glacial aridity and find it wanting. Of the three paleodune systems reported for tropical South America, that of NE Brazil was active in the Holocene as well as the Pleistocene. Parts of NE Brazil were actually moister than now in late-glacial times. Paleodunes in the Pantanal have never been seen on the ground, and those in the Orinoco Llanos are undated and may be of any age since the Tertiary. Arkosic sands in the Amazon fan deposits came from the Andean foothills or from down cutting by rivers and cannot be evidence of a former arid land surface. White sands of Amazonia formed as podzols, not by aeolian activity. Such Amazonian stone lines as have received critical scrutiny are concretionary pisolites in stratigraphic formations that are more than ten million years old. Although the Amazon was never arid, modeling cooler glacial tropics gives plausibility to a somewhat drier Amazon in glacial times, a concept given substance by pollen data for the movement of ecotones in Rondonia, by stream histories in the Bolivian Andes, and by evidence for lowered lake levels at Carajas and Lake Pata. But this reduced precipitation was never enough to fragment the forest in the Amazon lowlands themselves. Pleistocene mammals of the Napo river valley in Ecuador were able to live along the river system in a forested landscape. Our data suggest that the Amazon forests have been stable since the start of the Pleistocene, a fact that has contributed to the storage of vast diversity. The coming anthropogenic global warming and CO", " enrichment will add to the global warming already endured by Amazon biota in the Holocene. We think it possible that the expulsion from the lowland forests of heat intolerant species is already complete and that the forest property of maintaining its own microhabitat will allow the high species richness to survive more global warming, provided large enough tracts of forest are preserved."], "title": "Amazonian and neotropical plant communities on glacial time-scales: The failure of the aridity and refuge hypotheses"},

However, only little is known how variable this force is acting on different time scales ranging from minutes to millennia and how the climate system reacts to changes in this forcing. Changes of the global insolation can be related to the nuclear fusion in the core of the Sun, the energy transport through the radiative zone and the convection zone, the emission of radiation from the photosphere, and the distance between Sun and Earth. Satellite based measurements over two decades show a clear correlation between the solar irradiance and the 11-year sunspot cycle. The irradiance amplitude is about 0.1%. This is too small to affect significantly the climate. However, there are indications that, on longer time scales, solar variability could be much larger. The analysis of cosmogenic nuclides stored in natural archives provides a means to extend our knowledge of solar variability over much longer time periods. The response of the climate system to solar forcing depends not only on the amount of radiation, but also on its spectral composition (e.g. UV contribution), seasonal distribution over the globe, and feedback mechanisms connected with clouds, water vapour, ice cover, atmospheric and oceanic transport and other terrestrial processes. It is therefore difficult to establish a quantitative relationship between observed climate changes in the past and reconstructed solar variability. However, there is growing evidence that periods of low solar activity (so called minima) coincide with advances of glaciers, changes in lake levels, and sudden changes of climatic conditions. These findings point to an active role of the Sun in past climate changes beside other geophysical factors, internal variability of the climate system, and greenhouse gases. In fact a non-linear regression model to separate natural and anthropogenic forcing since 1850 is consistent with a solar contribution of about 40% to the global warming during the last 140 years."], "title": "The role of the sun in climate forcing"},

The high sensitivity results from effects of hemispheric or global-scale changes in circulation patterns of the ocean and atmosphere to influence the pathways and locations of air masses and storm tracks. Holocene paleoflood chronologies from the Upper Mississippi Valley in the Midwest United States and from the Colorado River drainage of the Southwest United States show that recurrence frequencies of large floods have been subject to abrupt changes over time. These flood chronologies and flood chronologies observed for other middle-latitude regions suggest that recurrence frequencies of large floods are increased when there is an increase in the number of waves and their amplitudes in the middle and upper tropospheric circum-polar westerly circulation. However, some middle-latitude regions on the western margins of continents experience increased frequencies of flooding during strong onshore zonal westerly circulation. Flood chronologies from several regions suggest that times of rapid climate change have a tendency to be associated with more frequent occurrences of large and extreme floods. The unusual high frequencies of large floods that have been observed in many regions since the early 1950s are often attributed to land use change, but the rapid climate forcing from the effects Of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases may also be a contributing factor.

Analysis of periodicity and duration of Pleistocene warmings allowed an inference that the Late Pleistocene climate changes differed in amplitude and frequency from those in the Early and Middle Pleistocene, when the territory of southern Siberia was dominated by moderate warm and humid climate. The amplitude and frequency of climatic fluctuations changed significantly after the Kazantsevian interglacial. Warming periods at that time were much shorter, cooler, and more arid. Despite the fact that the Holocene interglacial was cooler than the latest one (Kazantsevian, Eemian), it was much longer and warmer than the short warmings of Early Zyryanian and Karginian time. Thus, the trend of Late Cenozoic climatic changes has been turned to warming since Holocene time. It was found out that, during nearly each Pleistocene interglacial, thermophile Central Asian freshwater mollusks migrated to West Siberia. Hence, during large warming periods, Central Asia and Western Kazakhstan had developed drainage networks and were characterized by a humid climate. The hypsometry of warm Kazantsevian alluvium indicates that the river network evolved toward higher altitudes after the rise of the sea level associated with global warming and thawing of unstable ice sheets. Warming, along with greater humidity, led to higher stand of groundwaters and swamping of continental low plains. In the Holocene, despite some variability in the duration of alternating warm and cold periods, they show distinct recurrence at a periodicity of about 500 years.

Hypothetical process routes were composed involving three different EAF dust treatment processes, Waelz kiln, DC-furnace, and EZINEX, as well as scrap dezincing. The study shows that recycling of zinc used for galvanizing steel clearly has environmental benefits in that it saves zinc resources. However, zinc recovery does not necessarily decrease the potential impact on global warming and acidification. The magnitude of these two impact categories is tightly correlated with the amount and type of primary energy consumed in a process. Due to the high electricity consumption in the dezincing process, this route has the highest impact on Global Warming Potential as well as Acidification Potential. The major part of the energy requirement for the production of zinc from primary and secondary sources is consumed in the reduction of ZnO to Zn. The consequence is that the theoretically possible saving in primary energy by recycling zinc-containing materials is relatively small. The impact categories land use and waste generation are not considered in this study, but most likely the evaluation of such impacts would further increase the potential environmental impact of the landfill alternative.

The oil industry requires much better evidence than this before attributing reserve status to a resource, yet in the case of hydrates, enormous deposits (such as recently declared in New Caledonia) are reported on the strength of no more than uncertain seismic information. The gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) occurs in oceanic sediments over the first few hundred meters below the seabed. In this zone, any methane from organic material, including any seepages from below, is converted into solid hydrate, and is locked in place in the sediments. The origin of the methane is poorly understood, with even its biogenic origin being challenged. Dissolved methane or free gas may precipitate at geological discontinuities such as faults, fractures and lithological boundaries, as well as at water salinity, temperature and pressure interfaces. In the past, the porosity in the GHSZ was thought to be dominantly filled by hydrate, thus providing a seal to gas, at and below the base of the stability zone. However, at the Blake Ridge, ODP Leg 164 found only minor porosity (maximum of about 5%) being filled by hydrate or gas. The recent Leg 172 in the same area failed to find any hydrates at all. A much higher concentration has been indicated in the Japan National Oil Company hydrate borehole in the Nankai Trough, although this is contradicted by other reports. The Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) seismic reflector is caused mainly by gas bubbles at the base of the stability zone, which accordingly cannot act as a seal because the porosity is more than 95% filled by water, with the size of the pores and the gas bubbles being further factors. This is one reason why the BSR reflector does not correspond with the hydrate zones, as had been assumed. Cascadia, off Oregon, is one of the best places to investigate hydrates, as they crop out on the seafloor whereas on the Blake Ridge the first 200 m lack hydrates."], "title": "Oceanic hydrates: More questions than answers"},

A problem central to this is how climate change may influence population movements by altering the availability of thermal resources. In this study we investigate the links between climate and sea-temperature changes and squid arrival time off southwestern England over a 20-year period. We show that veined squid (Loligo forbesi) migrate eastwards in the English Channel earlier when water in the preceding months is warmer, and that higher temperatures and early arrival correspond with warm (positive) phases of the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO). The timing of squid peak abundance advanced by 120-150 days in the warmest years ('early' years) compared with the coldest ('late' years). Furthermore, sea-bottom temperature was closely linked to the extent of squid movement. Temperature increases over the five months prior to and during the month of peak squid abundance did not differ between early and late years, indicating squid responded to temperature changes independently of time of year. We conclude that the temporal variation in peak abundance of squid seen off Plymouth represents temperature-dependent movement, which is in turn mediated by climatic changes associated with the NAO. Such climate-mediated movement may be a widespread characteristic of cephalopod populations worldwide, and may have implications for future fisheries management because global warming may alter both the timing and location of peak population abundance."], "title": "Timing of squid migration reflects North Atlantic climate variability"},

We assessed whether year-to-year persistence in rank abundance and species composition tracked the NAO. 2. Persistence was quasi-cyclical and varied synchronously across all streams, irrespective of chemistry and catchment land use. Invertebrate communities in all stream types or habitats switched significantly from being highly persistent during negative phases of the NAO (winter index < 1 = cold, dry winters) to unstable during positive phases (> 1 = mild, wet winters). These effects occurred in both rare and common taxa. 3. Acid episodes could not explain low persistence in positive NAO years because variations in acid-base status were not linked to the NAO. Moreover, fluctuations in persistence were apparent even in well-buffered streams. 4. Discharge in adjacent gauged catchments increased in positive NAO years by 15-18% but neither flow variability nor flow maxima were higher. Nor were variations in invertebrate persistence at Llyn Brianne directly correlated with discharge pattern. Discharge variations alone were therefore insufficient to explain links between persistence and the NAO, but we cannot exclude subtle effects due either to flow or temperature. 5.

Results show the treated plots accumulated significantly less snow and had more extensive soil frost than reference plots. Snow depth was a strong regulator of soil temperature and frost depth at all sites. Soil moisture measured by time domain reflectometry probes and leaching volumes collected in lysimeters were lower in the treatment plots in March and April compared to the rest of the year.

In the context of the construction industry, these crises can be broadly classified in terms of environment, durability and sustainability. The crises have risen from a number of factors such as technological industrialisation, population growth, world-wide urbanisation, and uncontrolled pollution and creation of waste. There is now the real danger that the massive, indiscriminate and wasteful consumption of the world's material and energy resources may result in extensive global warming the is hard to reverse. The price for this environmental abuse is the rapid deterioration and distraction of the world's infrastructure, water shortages, environmental disasters, and material/structural deterioration by the forces of nature. Every crisis experienced in the world has a direct impact on the construction industry, and since the construction industry is closely interlinked with energy, resources and environment, irredeemable environmental degradation can only be prevented by sustainable development of the industry, which alone can give hope for a better world and better quality of life.

[1996a], (2) reclassification of rural, small-town, and urban stations in the United States, southern Canada, and northern Mexico based on satellite measurements of night light intensity [Imhoff et al., 1997], and (3) a more flexible urban adjustment than that employed by Hansen et al. [1999], including reliance on only unlit stations in the United States and rural stations in the rest of the world for determining long-term trends. We find evidence cf local human effects (\"urban warming\") even in suburban and small-town surface air temperature records, but the effect is modest in magnitude and conceivably could be an artifact of inhomogeneities in the station records. We suggest further studies, including more complete satellite night light analyses, which may clarify the potential urban effect. There are inherent uncertainties in the long-term temperature change at least of the order of 0.1\u00b0C for both the U.S. mean and the global mean.

To date, studies comparing these two systems have neglected rudimentary questions regarding the effort and energy expenditure of farmers, instead devoting attention to consumer health and selected environmental issues such as global warming and recent energy crises. The need to focus on the human energy problem is seen as fundamental in this paper as it concerns not just the balance of calorific expenditure and consumption but also the possible negative health affects associated with high levels of energy and effort expenditure. Assessment of human energy expenditures and effort, and their health effects is relatively under-developed; consequently this paper uses a pilot study to explore methodology on which future study and theory could be based. The method developed draws on three plausible models for assessing human energy and effort expenditure: the nutritional, physiological and ergonomic. The case study builds annual and daily profiles of energy and effort expenditure of two farmers using annual labour profiles and task specific energy expenditure and intensity derived from physical measurements. Although the scope of the experiment is limited, making inferences about each system is difficult, the results reveal clear differences in the annual energy and effort expenditures of the two farmers. Over a typical year the organic farmer experiences far more physical stress. Despite being more efficient in terms of overall energy, the organic farm is less efficient in terms of human energy, and the net energetic returns combined with effort intensity bring into question the health implications of organic livelihoods both in the short and long term. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Geological prospecting of the rich-storage zone of methane is an important precondition for gas recovery projects. Shear zones along coal seams have long been considered as a major place where gas outbursts occur during mining, but they also have a positive aspect in coalbed methane prospecting and production because of their great quantity of fractures and high methane content. Mercury penetrating experiments on a series of variously sheared coal samples from the Pingdingshan coalfield, China, were performed. The results showed that tectonically sheared coals possess three to eight times more porosity and two to ten times more specific surface area than their normal counterparts. Moreover, brittlely deformed coals possess larger average fracture apertures representing a good condition for methane extraction, whereas ductilely deformed coals show a fracture aperture even smaller than normal coals, which can explain why intensely sheared coals become difficult for methane extraction. The occurrence of a large number of tectonic fractures in a shear zone will make it easier for an artificial fracture to increase the permeability of coals in methane production. Therefore, except for locally ductile deformation areas, shear zones along coal seams are the best source and reservoir for methane gas production and, if this methane is extracted, it will help not only the reservoir but also protect the earth against global warming."], "title": "Pore structure of sheared coals and related coalbed methane"},

The tropical America modes of seasonal rainfall anomalies whose time variation is most accurately simulated by the GCM have been searched for using Singular Value Decomposition Analyses (SVDA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) between observed and model fields. The leading modes revealed by SVDA and CCA are highly similar, even though the ordering of the modes showed some fluctuation. A first skilful rainfall anomaly mode has weights of the same sign almost everywhere in tropical America, except along the western coast and the sub-tropical margins. This mode appears in all of the four seasons assessed. A second major skilful mode is usually a bipolar north-south (N-S) rainfall anomaly pattern (clear in December-March, DJFM; March-May, MAM; and June-September, JJAS). A large portion of the skill of the first rainfall anomaly mode (same sign anomalies across tropical America except small patches along the western coast) is through variance that is in common with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). In addition to forcing from the central/eastern tropical Pacific SST, there also appears a contribution from contrasting SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic. This rainfall mode is usually a regional portion of a more large-scale mode encompassing at least the whole tropical zone (especially in DJFM, MAM and September-November, SON). Analysis of the relationship of this mode with GCM circulation features reveals that a rainfall deficit (respectively excedent) over the main rainbelt of the tropical America region is associated with strengthening (respectively weakening) of the sub-tropical westerly jet streams, a global warming (respectively cooling) of the tropical atmosphere, an anomalous divergence (respectively convergence) in the lower levels and anomalous convergence (respectively divergence) in the upper levels over tropical America and in the region of the Atlantic Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Such global features are not so apparent for the dominant mode of JJAS, even though the correlations with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indicators (as SOI or NINO3 SST index) are as high as for the other seasons. The bipolar N-S rainfall anomaly mode in tropical America is mostly related to anomalous N-S gradient of SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic. The atmospheric circulation anomalies emphasize changes in 850 hPa meridional winds in the tropical Atlantic. However, there is also interannual variance of this rainfall mode in both the model and observations that is unexplained by tropical Atlantic SSTs, but which is explained by central/eastern tropical Pacific SSTs and, potentially, SSTs from other tropical and extratropical areas. This is especially true in MAM. Some differences in the details of the model and observed teleconnection patterns are noted. Such differences can be used to statistically adjust the model simulations using the CCA or SVDA modes as basis patterns. Both statistical approaches have been applied and the results are consistent between the two. The increase of skill is stronger when temporal correlation (the pattern correlation) between the model and observed pattern is high (low) as for JJAS. The skill is moderate to high around the whole Amazon basin, but remains relatively low inside the Amazon basin, though reliability of the observations themselves may influence this result. Averaged over all the seasons, about 15-35% (35-55%) of the interannual grid-box (regional) seasonal rainfall variance is skilfully simulated from the observed SST forcing.

The potential distribution Shifts of four tree species (Diospyros virginiana, Oxydendron arboreum, Pinus virginiana, Quercus falcata var. falcata) whose northern distribution limits fall in the southern third of Ohio were used to assess possible distribution shift scenarios as a result of global warming. Our predictions derive from the results of simulations using (a) forest inventory based estimates of current distribution and abundance of target species; (b) a satellite-based estimate of forest habitat availability; and (c) a tree migration model (SHIFT). The current distribution and abundance of trees was estimated using USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory Analysis data and distribution maps from the late 1960s; pre-European settlement forest-nonforest maps were used to represent the fully forested condition for calibration and comparison. Habitat-availability estimates in Ohio were estimated using classified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data from 1994. Tree abundance, forest availability and migration were modeled using a 1-km", " pixel size. Forest availability was estimated as the proportion of forested TM pixels within each cell. The probability of a migrating species colonizing an unoccupied cell is modeled as a function of forest availability and distance to occupied cells. The results of the migration models suggest that the species studied are capable of colonizing virtually any forested location within Ohio over the next 100 years if climatic controls over the current distribution that may currently inhibit northward movement are relaxed. The contiguous distribution of these species, however, is not likely to shift more than 10 km during the next century regardless of the magnitude of the climate change. Examining the sensitivity of our simulations by varying critical model attributes, we found that whereas the variables controlling the amount of long-distance dispersal have strong effects on migration rates in the fully forested 1800 situation, they have significantly lesser effects on projections of future migration into highly fragmented forests. The low forest availability that characterizes much of the current Ohio landscape, along with the low likelihood of long distance dispersal, result in potential distribution shifts that are concentrated within the principally forested corridors in southeastern Ohio. We propose that in contrast to the past, future tree migrations are likely to be spatially and temporally correlated as a result of large climatic forcing and channelization through limited regions of available habitat. With respect to the management of biodiversity, this result suggests that it may be very difficult to discern plant migrations of native forest species owing to exceedingly slow rates of movement."], "title": "Predicting the potential future distribution of four tree species in Ohio using current habitat availability and climatic forcing"},

Previous modelling studies have concluded that major shifts in vegetation patterns, including changes in boreal forest extent, could arise during the next two centuries under global warming scenarios.

This study uses a c. 25-year record of Landsat satellite observations to quantify changes in forest stand extent in two areas of northern Canada. Location: Two regions of northern Canada, near Richmond Gulf, Quebec, and Great Slave Lake, north-west Territories. Methods: Normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) plots across forest-tundra boundaries were obtained from radiometrically corrected Landsat imagery acquired during the 1970s and 1990s. These curves were evaluated to look for changes over the c. 25-year period related to forest stand expansion. Results: Although forest-tundra boundaries could be clearly mapped from the satellite data, no obvious change in forest boundaries was apparent during the duration of the image time series, constraining recent geographical expansion rates to < 200-300 m per century. Also, no evidence for local expansion of forest stands (e.g. within sheltered valleys) was found. Main conclusions: The results are consistent with field observations, and suggest that, at the moment, boreal forest extents remain basically stable.

The absence of curlews from five territories coincided with neap (low) tides; four of these curlews held territories at lower intertidal elevations with gently sloping topographies, such that they were inundated longer than other territories. At the Elk River estuary, territoriality may limit the number of curlews using intertidal habitats, but individual variation in territory residency suggests that numbers, and possibly carrying capacity, changed seasonally with availability of food in intertidal and pasture habitats.

We conducted an experiment with migratory blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) to investigate how the photoperiodic conditions experienced by birds hatching earlier in the season affect the timing of post-juvenile moult and the onset of autumn migration. In a splitbrood experiment, we reared 30 nestlings from six different families and kept them either under a photoperiodic regime simulating conditions 6 weeks before their actual hatching date or under simulated natural photoperiods. Time-shifted birds started moulting at an earlier age compared to controls and showed an early phase of nocturnal migratory activity. Under the influence of long day lengths moult was prolonged and migratory activity was interrupted. However, the termination of moult and the reinitiation of migratory activity were not delayed to the extent that birds compensated for the simulated early hatching date.

As the area they have left declines, so will their rates of speciation. This loss of speciation will occur for two reasons: species with larger geographical ranges speciate faster; and loss of area drives up extinction rates, thus reducing the number of species available for speciation. Theory predicts steady states in species diversity, and fossils suggest that these have typified life for most of the past 500 million years. Modern and fossil evidence indicates that, at the scale of the whole earth and its major biogeographical provinces, those steady states respond linearly, or nearly so, to available area. Hence, a loss of x% of area will produce a loss of about x% of species. Local samples of habitats merely echo the diversity available in the whole province of which they are a part. So, conservation tactics that rely on remnant patches to preserve diversity cannot succeed for long. Instead, diversity will decay to a depauperate steady state in two phases. The first will involve deterministic extinctions, reflecting the loss of all areas in which a species can ordinarily sustain its demographics. The second will be stochastic, reflecting accidents brought on by global warming, new diseases, and commingling the species of the separate bio-provinces. A new kind of conservation effort, reconciliation ecology, can avoid this decay. Reconciliation ecology discovers how to modify and diversify anthropogenic habitats so that they harbor a wide variety of species.

In Israel, minimum summer temperatures increased by an average of 0.26 \u00b0C per decade during the second half of the 20th century.

Numerous studies have reported general correlations between body mass in fossil animals and independently established palaeoclimatic changes from various parts of the world in accordance with this rule. Using museum specimens, I tested the prediction that the body mass and tarsus length of five resident passerine species in Israel declined between 1950 and 1999. The body mass of four species (the graceful warbler Prinia gracilis, the house sparrow Passer domesticus, the yellow-vented bulbul Pycnonotus xanthopygos and the Sardinian warbler Sylvia melanocephala, but not of the crested lark Galerida cristata) declined significantly during this period. Tarsus length also declined significantly during this period for two species (the graceful warbler and the house sparrow). Body condition (body mass-to-tarsus length ratio) decreased in the Sardinian warbler, the yellow-vented bulbul and the crested lark. It is suggested that the above declines in body mass and tarsus length are due to global warming and also in accordance with Bergmann's rule. The above explanation does not exclude the possibility that other factors, such as a decrease in food availability, contributed to the decline in body mass.

The immediate consequence of the fires was the production of large amounts of haze in the region, causing visibility and health problems within Southeast Asia. Furthermore, fires of these magnitudes are potential contributors to global warming and climate change due to the emission of large amounts of greenhouse gases and other pyrogenic products.The long-range transport of fire-related haze in the region is investigated using trajectories from the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research Limited Area Model (DARLAM). Emission scenarios were constructed for hotspot areas in Sumatra and Kalimantan for the months of September and October 1997 to determine the period and fire locations most critical to Singapore. This study also examines some transport issues raised from field observations. Results show that fires in the coastal areas of southeast Sumatra and southwest Kalimantan can be potential contributors to transboundary air pollution in Singapore. Singapore was directly affected by haze from these areas whereas Kuala Lumpur was heavily affected by the haze coming from Sumatra. In most cases, Singapore was more affected by fires from Kalimantan than was Kuala Lumpur. This was mainly a result of the shifting of monsoons. The transition of monsoons resulted in weaker low-level winds and shifted convergence zones near to the southeast of Peninsular Malaysia. In addition to severe drought and massive fire activity in 1997, the timing of the monsoon transition has a strong influence on haze transport in the region.

On daily time scales, IR-sampled UTH contains large data gaps in convectively active areas, with only about 20-30 % of the tropics (30S-30N) being sampled.

Methods: Frost resistance of cut shoots was determined at approximately monthly intervals between February 1994 and March 1995. Shoots were exposed to a range of freezing temperatures and scored for damage. Freezing resistance was determined as the temperature that caused 50% damage to the shoots. Results: The frost resistance of the common heaths was in accord with their geographical distribution. Calluna vulgaris and E. tetralix extend furthest north and east in Europe and developed the greatest frost resistance in winter (< -20 \u00b0C). Erica cinerea is widespread throughout the British Isles with an oceanic south-western distribution in Europe and was resistant to only -13 \u00b0C. Erica vagans has a similar frost resistance to E. cinerea but has a restricted distribution in the British Isles, whilst the other rare heaths are more frost resistant than either E. cinerea or E. vagans. The frost resistance of all species increased with shorter daylengths and decreased with higher temperatures, suggesting that global warming might result in increased sensitivity to frost in these species. Main conclusions: Whilst the distributions of the common heath species are in accord with their frost resistance, those of the rarer heaths are not.

For the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) the Eco-indicator 95 method has been chosen, because this is a well-documented and regularly applied impact assessment method. The resulting index is called Eco-indicator value. The higher the Eco-indicator value the stronger is the total environmental impact of an analysed system. A sugar beet field experiment conducted in northeastern Germany was chosen as an example for the analysis. In this experiment three different nitrogen fertilisers (calcium ammonium nitrate = CAN, urea ammonium nitrate solution = UAN, urea) were used at optimum N rates. The obtained Eco-indicator values were clearly different for the N fertilisers used in the sugar beet trial. The highest value was observed for the system where urea was used as N source. The lowest Eco-indicator value has been calculated for the CAN system. The differences are mainly due to different ammonia volatilisation after application of the N fertilisers. For all the systems the environmental effects of acidification and eutrophication contributed most to the total Eco-indicator value. The results show that the LCA methodology, is basically suitable to assess the environmental impact associated with agricultural production.

Our results, as generated from two mitochondrial DNA markers (the D-loop and cytochrome b), suggest an origin of the hartebeest in eastern Africa from where the species has colonized other parts of the continent. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an early diversification into southern and northern hartebeest lineages, an event that may be related to the formation of the Rift Valley lakes. The northern lineage has further diverged into eastern and western lineages, most probably as a result of the expanding central African rainforest belt and subsequent contraction of savannah habitats during a period of global warming. The diversification events appear to have coincided with major climatic changes and are highly correlated in time. These observations strongly suggest that large-scale climatic fluctuations have been a major determinant for the species' evolutionary history and that hartebeest evolution has mainly taken place in isolated yet environmentally favourable refugia during periods of global warming. Indications of sudden population expansion for two putative ancestral hartebeest populations provide further support for a refugia-based explanation of the diversification events.

The relative prices then determine the trade-off between gases at each point in time, taking into account economical as well as physical considerations.

The first, a mainly diffusive movement through the rhizosphere from the anaerobic source regions of the soil and into and along the roots to the root-rhizome junction. The second, the removal of the gas from the root-rhizome junction to the atmosphere through the rhizome-culm system, a process often dominated by convective (pressurised) gas flow. This article addresses the first of these stages and is presented in isolation because of its perceived commonality to wetland plants in general. The model treats the root and its oxygenated rhizosphere as a series of concentric cylinders: two non-(or low) porosity stelar cylinders, a highly porous cortex, a non-porous epidermal/hypodermal cylinder and the rhizosphere itself. The methane source lies at the edge of the oxygenated rhizosphere the dimensions of which are determined by the integrated effects of oxygen consumption in root and rhizosphere (the latter including a methanotrophic element) and the diffusive impedances throughout the system. The results demonstrate something of the complexity of root-methane-oxygen relations. Methane entry from the rhizosphere is shown to vary along the length of any individual root and, as expected, methane oxidation within the rhizosphere is found to reduce the potential for methane loss to the atmosphere. Situations are also revealed: (i) where the methane concentration falls to zero within the rhizosphere because of aerobic microbial consumption supported by radial oxygen loss from the root, and (ii) where methane may enter the root at one point and escape to the rhizosphere at some other. In this latter case, methane concentration minima are possible within the rhizosphere supplied by methane fluxes from both the root and the bulk soil.

Phragmites australis originating from higher latitudes showed higher relative length growth rates (RLGR), and flowered earlier in time than that from lower latitudes. Plants from Spain even continued growth until the first autumn frosts. When grown in the different common environments, population differences were found in RLGR, but no general trend was apparent. On average, shoots started to grow 2 weeks earlier in The Netherlands than in Denmark and 6 weeks earlier than in the Czech Republic.

In figs, mortality was significantly higher in pioneers, but hemiepiphytes and roadside species were unaffected. Phenology was substantially affected. Leaf and flower/fruit production decreased or ceased during the drought and increased suddenly following renewed rain. Pollinators of dioecious figs became locally extinct during the drought, and other plant-animal interactions may also have been disrupted. The frequency and severity of droughts has increased substantially in the past three decades, and climate models suggest this may be the result of global warming.

This analysis of the composite, century-scale, regional GST histories (GSTHs) is based on the deepest available borehole temperature logs from the Foreland Sedimentary Basin in western and northern Canada, east of the Cordillera. Although separated by almost 20\u00b0 latitude, there is strong regional correlation (r = 0.98) between the GSTHs developed from northern (boreal forest) and southern (prairie grassland) boreholes. When filtered, the GSTHs of western Canada correlate strongly with the northern hemisphere (r = 0.80) and the Canadian Arctic (r = 0.86) high temporal resolution proxy climate histories. Strong correlation also exists between the prairie grassland GSTH curve and the tree-ring-based surface summer temperature history from the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rocky Mountains close to Athabasca Glacier (r = 0.95).

About 90% of the global warming during El Ni\u00f1o occurs in the tropical global ocean from 20\u00b0 S to 20\u00b0 N, half because of large SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific associated with El Ni\u00f1o and the other half because of warm SST anomalies occurring over \u223c80% of the tropical global ocean. From examination of National Centers for Environmental Prediction [Kalnay et al., 1996] and Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set [Woodruff et al., 1993] reanalyses, tropical global warming during El Ni\u00f1o is associated with higher troposphere moisture content and cloud cover, with reduced trade wind intensity occurring during the onset phase of El Ni\u00f1o. During this onset phase the tropical global average diabatic heat storage tendency in the layer above the main pycnocline is 1-3 W m", " above normal. Its principal source is a reduction in the poleward Ekman heat flux out of the tropical ocean of 2-5 W m", ".

In the extratropical global ocean the reduction in poleward Ekman heat flux out of the tropics during the onset of El Ni\u00f1o tends to be balanced by reduction in the flux of latent heat to the troposphere. Thus global warming and cooling during Earth's internal mode of interannual climate variability arise from fluctuations in the global hydrological balance, not the global radiation balance.

The two measures of spring's onset that are employed are the timing of first bloom of lilac and honeysuckle bushes from a long-term cooperative phonological network, and the timing of the first major pulse of snowmelt recorded from high-elevation streams. Both measures contain year-to-year fluctuations, with typical year-to-year fluctuations at a given site of one to three weeks. These fluctuations are spatially coherent, forming regional patterns that cover most of the west. Fluctuations in lilac first bloom dates are highly correlated to those of honeysuckle, and both are significantly correlated with those of the spring snowmelt pulse. Each of these measures, then, probably respond to a common mechanism. Various analyses indicate that anomalous temperature exerts the greatest influence upon both interannual and secular changes in the onset of spring in these networks. Earlier spring onsets since the late 1970s are a remarkable feature of the records, and reflect the unusual spell of warmer-than-normal springs in western North America during this period.

If bleaching becomes an annual event later in this century, more than 90% of coral reefs worldwide may be at risk of long-term degradation. While corals can recover from single isolated bleaching and can acclimate to recurring bleaching events that are separated by multiple years, it is currently unknown if and how they will survive and possibly acclimatize to annual coral bleaching. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that annual coral bleaching can dramatically alter thermal tolerance in Caribbean corals. We found that high coral energy reserves and changes in the dominant algal endosymbiont type (Symbiodinium spp.) facilitated rapid acclimation in Porites divaricata, whereas low energy reserves and a lack of algal phenotypic plasticity significantly increased susceptibility in Porites astreoides to bleaching the following year. Phenotypic plasticity in the dominant endosymbiont type of Orbicella faveolata did not prevent repeat bleaching, but may have facilitated rapid recovery. Thus, coral holobiont response to an isolated single bleaching event is not an accurate predictor of its response to bleaching the following year. Rather, the cumulative impact of annual coral bleaching can turn some coral species 'winners' into 'losers', and can also facilitate acclimation and turn some coral species 'losers' into 'winners'. Overall, these findings indicate that cumulative impact of annual coral bleaching could result in some species becoming increasingly susceptible to bleaching and face a long-term decline, while phenotypically plastic coral species will acclimatize and persist. Thus, annual coral bleaching and recovery could contribute to the selective loss of coral diversity as well as the overall decline of coral reefs in the Caribbean. \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."], "title": "The cumulative impact of annual coral bleaching can turn some coral species winners into losers"},

The key problems of fuel variation and thermal shock resistance of the ceramic are addressed through the concept of 'reaction gradient' in which the rich sequence of oxidation reactions during combustion is spread through three extended catalytic regimes along the isothermal ceramic device.

Using archives and dendroecological data we reconstructed the fire frequency in four large sectors along a transect from eastern Ontario to central Quebec. Results showed a dramatic decrease in fire frequency that began in the mid-19th century and has been accentuated during the 20th century. Although all areas showed a similar temporal decrease in area burned, we observed a gradual increase in fire frequency from the west to Abitibi east, followed by a slight decrease in central Quebec. The global warming that has been occurring since the end of the Little Ice Age (1850) may have created a climate less prone to large forest fires in the eastern boreal forest of North America. This interpretation is corroborated by predictions of a decrease in forest fires for that region of the boreal forest in the future. A longer fire cycle (i.e., the time needed to burn an area equivalent to the study area) has important consequences for sustainable forest management of the boreal forest of eastern Canada. When considering the important proportion of overmature and old-growth stands in the landscape resulting from the elongation of the fire cycles, it becomes difficult to justify clear-cutting practices over all the entire area as well as short rotations as a means to emulate natural disturbances.

Besides contamination of seafood, these organisms have also been involved in human and marine wildlife mortality. The article aims to give an overview of all biological and environmental factors that should be considered when trying to evaluate a possible increase in toxic blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia spp.. Pseudo-nitzschia blooms characteristically occur in a low light regime, at a time when the temperature is falling and at a wide range of salinities. Laboratory studies have shown that the production of domoic acid, a water-soluble amino acid, is related to silicon, phosphorus, nitrogen and trace metal (mainly iron) availability. Domoic acid has no known function in defence or primary metabolism; a role in excretion of excess photosynthetic energy or as a binding ligand for trace metals is suggested. The variability in domoic acid production by different Pseudo-nitzschia spp., or the presence of toxic and non-toxic strains of the same species, cannot be explained. The conclusion is drawn that an increase in toxic blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. might be possible, especially because of the expected increase in nutrient availability from pollution and desert dust. Global warming may have an influence as well by lengthening the growth period for Pseudo-nitzschia, enlarging their global distribution and increasing the dust load through desertification. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V."], "title": "Domoic acid: A fascinating marine toxin"},

The lapse rates of daily maximum and minimum temperatures show strong seasonal and diurnal patterns, and relationships with synoptic conditions, classified using the Lamb classification. Synoptic types with westerly components show the most rapid decrease of temperature with elevation. Lapse rates are also steeper when there is a strong altitudinal increase in cloud cover, decrease in sunshine duration, or strong wind shear. Lapse rates are becoming steeper by day but weaker at night (p < 0.1%). Such changes occur within most synoptic types, and there are not many statistically significant changes in relative airflow frequencies. Weak relationships exist between measurements of the NAO and lapse rates, but within airflow-type modification is also influential, being connected with changes in SSTs to the west of the U.K. Correlations between mean monthly lapse rates and SSTs vary spatially. Low SSTs in the north and high SSTs in the south of the region encourage steep daytime lapse rates, implying a steeper lapse rate under a stronger meridional temperature gradient. At night the opposite relationship holds. Over time there has been strengthening in the meridional SST gradient to the west of the U.K., confirmed by analysis of a SST data set from CRU (1968-1995).

Quality insurance loss data for several major storm types (thunder, hail, winter, and wind storms) were available, plus quality data on flood and hurricane losses, and all were adjusted to 1997 dollars. Techniques were developed to assess the effect of seasonal climate extremes on major crop yields and costs for electricity and natural gas consumed. Trends were upward for certain key variables between 1950 and 1997, including the incidence and losses associated with winter storms, flood losses, crop losses, and incidence of heavy rains. Trends were downward for other weather-driven loss variables including hurricane losses, energy costs, thunderstorm losses, wind storm losses, and hail losses. Nine loss variables were selected to develop the U.S. annual loss index, and in rank order, based on their average annual loss values, were energy costs, followed by losses from hurricanes, floods, severe convective storms, crops, tornadoes, winter storms, hail, and wind storms. The variables chosen also will be available in future years to allow a continuing assessment using the index. The 1950-1997 average annual index value was $17.47 billion (1997 dollars), with annual values ranging from a high of $54.4 billion in 1972 to a low of $2.4 billion in 1963.

With unlimited food, growth increased rapidly as temperature increased to 14\u00b0C, then displayed a more gradual rise to 22\u00b0C.

A similar response to temperature was observed at low rations, although at lower overall growth rates. At 24\u00b0C, there was a severe decline in growth for both ration levels, and few fish survived the 3 wk experiments. Gross growth efficiency, measured at temperatures of 6 to 22\u00b0C, displayed an interactive effect of temperature with ration level consistent with bioenergetic relationship. Conversion peaked at 16 to 20\u00b0C for fish receiving ad libitum rations, and at 10\u00b0C for fish on restricted rations. Conversion rates of sablefish were comparable to those calculated for a diverse array of fish species, suggesting that the rapid growth rates are driven by high consumption rather than unusually efficient energy transfer. Experiments analyzing sablefish behavior in thermally stratified water columns demonstrated increasing movement into colder water as ration level decreased, in agreement with an energy conserving strategy. Average monthly temperatures within the major nursery areas of neustonic juveniles (north of 40\u00b0N) did not exceed 19\u00b0C during the last 19 yr. These results suggest that juvenile sablefish are capable of tolerating and thriving at increased temperatures, with the critical caveat that sufficient food resources must be available. Thus, impacts on early life stages exerted by El Ni\u00f1o conditions, oceanographic regime shifts, or climate changes induced by current global warming scenarios are likely to be a consequence of indirect effects on circulation and productivity patterns rather than direct effects of warmer temperatures. However, because the upper thermal limit for growth nearly coincides with the upper limit for survival, exhibiting a sharp demarcation between favorable growth conditions and intolerable temperatures, juvenile sablefish at the southern limit of their distribution may suffer the direct effects of elevated temperature; recruitment of juveniles to southern populations may become more sporadic if the frequency of warming events increases with climate change."], "title": "Growth and behavioral responses to elevated temperatures by juvenile sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria and the interactive role of food availability"},

One is the control (CTRL) run with fixed present-day concentrations of greenhouse gases. The other experiment is a simulation of transient greenhouse warming, named GHG run. In the GHG run the averaged geopotential height at 500 hPa is increased significantly, and a negative phase of the Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection-like distribution pattern is intensified. The standard deviation over the tropics (high latitudes) is enhanced (reduced) on the interdecadal time scales and reduced (enhanced) on the interannual time scales in the GHG run.

But some teleconnection patterns show linear trends and changes of variances and frequences in the GHG run. Apart from the positive linear trend of the SO, the interdecadal modulation to the El Nino/SO cycle is enhanced during the GHG 2040 \u039f 2099. This is the result of an enhancement of the Walker circulation during that period. La Nina events intensify and El Nino events relatively weaken during the GHG 2070 \u039f 2090. It is interesting to note that with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations the relation between the SO and the PNA pattern is reversed significantly from a negative to a positive correlation on the interdecadal time scales and weakened on the interannual time scales.

Climate model simulations are presented that examine how loss of sea ice affects the ocean salinity and density structure, and rates of uptake of an idealized transient tracer. The latter results are indicative of how loss of sea ice might affect the ocean's rate of uptake of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere. In simulations in which there is no freshwater forcing due to sea ice forming or melting, the salinity minimum associated with Antarctic Intermediate Water is much weaker than in simulations of the present-day ocean. This suggests that this salinity minimum is maintained in part by a steady supply of freshwater from melting of Antarctic sea ice.

Incorporating new findings on the radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) aerosols, the magnitude of the climate sensitivity, and the strength of the climate/carbon cycle feedbacks into a simple upwelling diffusion/energy balance model similar to the one that was used in the TAR, we find that the range of projected warming for the 1990-2100 period is reduced to 1.1-2.8\u00b0C.

A key issue is whether the Earth's feedback mechanisms can become unstable on their own, or whether some forcing is required to precipitate a catastrophe of this magnitude.

Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of HFE-7500 in Japan were determined with the Higashino model, a Gausian puff and plume model that used an approximation of environmental releases to the atmosphere as input to the model. Allowable concentrations to protect aquatic life, wildlife, and humans from noncancer effects were determined as detailed in USEPA's Final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes Systems. Potential risk to ecological receptors and humans was determined by calculating hazard quotients and margins of safety. The results of the risk assessment indicate that HFE-7500 poses no significant risk to either aquatic or terrestrial wildlife species or humans living in the Japanese environment.

This simulation has been initialised with the oceanic temperature and salinity profiles and the atmospheric trace gas concentrations observed in the 1950s, and has been carried out for 150 years after a 20-year spin-up. The simulated climate change has been analysed as the difference between two 30-year time slices: 1970-2000 and 2070-2100 respectively. The model achieves a reasonable simulation of present-day climate and simulates a general increase in precipitation throughout the twenty first century. The main exceptions are the subtropics, where the enhanced Hadley circulation has a drying impact, and the mid-latitude continents, where the increased evaporation in spring and decreased moisture convergence in summer lead to a relative summer drying. Global and regional analyses suggest that the precipitation increase is generally limited by a decrease in the water vapour cycling rate and in the precipitation efficiency, which appear as key parameters of the simulated water cycle. In order to reduce the spread between climate scenarios, more efforts should be devoted to estimate these parameters from satellite observations and meteorological analyses, and their possible evolution over recent decades. In the present study, the impacts of global warming on the surface hydrology have been also investigated. The main findings are the amplification of the annual cycle of soil moisture in the mid-and-high latitudes, and the decrease in the Northern Hemisphere snow cover, at a rate that is consistent with recent satellite estimations and should increase during the twenty first century. The runoff simulated over the 1950-2100 period has been converted into river flow using a linear river routeing model. The trends simulated over recent decades are surprisingly consistent with the river flow measurements available from the Global Runoff Data Centre. These trends can differ from those estimated over the whole 150-year integration, thereby indicating that it is not safe to predict hydrological impacts just by extrapolating the trends found in the available observations.

This could represent a severe threat for agriculture in the regions concerned, where summer is the main growing season. These predictions must however be considered as uncertain, since most studies featuring enhanced summer dryness in mid-latitudes use very simple representations of the land-surface processes (\"bucket\" models), despite their key importance for the issue considered. The current study uses a regional climate model including a land-surface scheme of intermediate complexity to investigate the sensitivity of the summer climate to enhanced greenhouse warming over the American Midwest. A surrogate climate change scenario is used for the simulation of a warmer climate. The control runs are driven at the lateral boundaries and the sea surface by reanalysis data and observations, respectively. The warmer climate experiments are forced by a modified set of initial and lateral boundary conditions. The modifications consist of a uniform 3 K temperature increase and an attendant increase of specific humidity (unchanged relative humidity). This strategy maintains a similar dynamical forcing in the warmer climate experiments, thus allowing to investigate thermodynamical impacts of climate change in comparative isolation. The atmospheric CO", " concentration of the sensitivity experiments is set to four times its pre-industrial value. The simulations are conducted from March 15 to October 1st, for 4 years corresponding to drought (1988), normal (1986, 1990) and flood (1993) conditions. The numerical experiments do not present any great enhancement of summer drying under warmer climatic conditions. First, the overall changes in the hydrological cycle (especially evapotranspiration) are of small magnitude despite the strong forcing applied. Second, precipitation increases in spring lead to higher soil water recharge during this season, compensating for the enhanced soil moisture depletion occurring later in the year. Additional simulations replacing the plant control on transpiration with a bucket- type formulation presented increased soil drying in 1988, the drought year. This suggests that vegetation control on transpiration might play an important part in counteracting an enhancement of summer drying when soil water gets limited. Though further aspects of this issue would need investigating, our results underline the importance of land-surface processes in climate integrations and suggest that the risk of enhanced summer dryness in the region studied might be less acute than previously assumed, provided the North American general circulation does not change markedly with global warming."], "title": "Summer dryness in a warmer climate: A process study with a regional climate model"},

Interest was primarily in seasonal variation in species composition, biomass and primary production. Initially our monitoring was not intended to extend beyond the IBP programme, which ended in 1971. However, the example and support of Jan Beukema and the interesting links with his work on secondary production in the Wadden Sea were decisive in its continuation. As a result, we now have a time series of well over 30 years. We had the good luck to start in a period of relatively low phytoplankton values, whereas in the late 1970s biomass and primary production doubled in a short period. Duration of the Phaeocystis blooms, which regularly occur in spring and early summer in Dutch coastal waters, also increased. Light limitation plays a dominant role in turbid coastal waters. Our Secchi disc data up to 1985 did not indicate changes in turbidity, and therefore increases were seen as a eutrophication phenomenon. What would then be more natural than to expect phytoplankton to decrease again with the lowering of phosphate values in the 1980s and 1990s as a result of the successful cleaning of the Rhine? The data up to 1992 did not show any effect on phytoplankton of this de-eutrophication. Annual primary production during the period 1992-2000 decreased from a peak value of>400 gC m", " in 1994 to ca. 250 now. Over the entire period 1974-2000, a slight increase in turbidity was observed. Phosphate concentrations have dropped a little further since 1992, but as could be expected, dissolved nitrogen (nitrate, nitrite and ammonia) and reactive silica did not show changes since the mid 1970s; inputs from freshwater and the atmosphere have not decreased. In accordance with the decrease of primary production, also chlorophyll-a and Phaeocystis cell numbers have dropped since 1994. These first signs of a decrease in phytoplankton parameters probably related to de-eutrophication make continuation of our Marsdiep monitoring highly interesting. No lengthening of the growing season of phytoplankton was observed comparable to that observed in terrestrial vegetation and related to global warming, but Phaeocystis growth seems to start earlier now. Our phytoplankton research covers only a small part of the period of man-induced changes of the Wadden Sea ecosystem, which started already in the Middle Ages. Certainly the recent overfishing of filter feeders such as cockles and mussels has affected phytoplankton, but also the cultivation of mussels and introduction of exotics such as Crassostrea gigas and Ensis directus must have influenced phytoplankton. The Marsdiep phytoplankton time series has proved to be useful in the continued ecosystem research in the western Wadden Sea.

Game theory can be used to describe behavioural decisions that individuals make in response to interference, prey depletion, territorial behaviour or social dominance, and the resultant fitness consequences. It is then possible to predict how survival or reproductive output changes with population size. From this we can then make predictions about the responses of populations to environmental changes. We will illustrate how this can be applied to a range of species and a range of applied problems."], "title": "Behavioural models of population growth rates: Implications for conservation and prediction"},

Mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource, being important nursery grounds and breeding sites for birds, fish, crustaceans, shellfish, reptiles and mammals; a renewable source of wood; accumulation sites for sediment, contaminants, carbon and nutrients; and offer protection against coastal erosion. The destruction of mangroves is usually positively related to human population density. Major reasons for destruction are urban development, aquaculture, mining and overexploitation for timber, fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Over the next 25 years, unrestricted clear felling, aquaculture, and overexploitation of fisheries will be the greatest threats, with lesser problems being alteration of hydrology, pollution and global warming. Loss of biodiversity is, and will continue to be, a severe problem as even pristine mangroves are species-poor compared with other tropical ecosystems. The future is not entirely bleak. The number of rehabilitation and restoration projects is increasing worldwide with some countries showing increases in mangrove area. The intensity of coastal aquaculture appears to have levelled off in some parts of the world. Some commercial projects and economic models indicate that mangroves can be used as a sustainable resource, especially for wood.

The atmospheric component is a two-dimensional (zonally average) statistical-dynamical model based on the Goddard Institute for Space Study's atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). In contrast with energy-balance models used in some climate models of intermediate complexity, this model includes full representation of the hydrological and momentum cycles. It also has parameterizations of the main physical processes, including a sophisticated radiation code. The ocean component is a coarse resolution ocean GCM with simplified global geometry based on the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory modular ocean model. Because of the simplified geometry the resolution in the western boundary layers can be readily increased compared to conventional coarse resolution models, without increasing the model's computational requirements in a significant way. The ocean model's efficiency is also greatly increased by using a moderate degree of asynchronous coupling between the oceanic momentum and tracer fields. We demonstrate that this still allows an accurate simulation of transient behavior, including the seasonal cycle. A 100 years simulation with the model requires less than 8 hours on a state-of the art workstation. The main novelty of the model is therefore a combination of computational efficiency, statistical dynamical atmosphere and 3D ocean. Long-term present-day climate simulations are carried out using the coupled model with and without flux adjustments, and with either the Gent-McWilliams (GM) parametrization scheme or horizontal diffusion (HD) in the ocean. Deep ocean temperatures systematically decrease in the runs without flux adjustment. We demonstrate that the mismatch between heat transports in the uncoupled states of two models is the main cause for the systematic drift. In addition, changes in the circulation and sea-ice formation also contribute to the drift. Flux adjustments in the freshwater fluxes are shown to have a stabilizing effect on the thermohaline circulation in the model, whereas the adjustments in the heat fluxes tend to weaken the global \"conveyor\". To evaluate the model's response to transient external forcing global warming simulations are also carried out with the flux-adjusted version of the coupled model.

The global mean surface air temperature of the coupled model increases by about 2.3\u00b0C above the preindustrial level by the middle of the 21st century. Accompanying the warming, the global mean rates of both precipitation and evaporation increase by 5.2%, yielding the average increase in the rate of runoff by approximately 7.3%. The increase in the rate of runoff simulated by the model is particularly large in high northern latitudes, where the runoff from some rivers such as the Mackenzie and Ob\u2032 may increase by as much as 20%. Runoff from many European rivers increases by more than 20%. Runoff also increases substantially in some tropical rivers such as the Amazon and Ganges. However, the percentage changes in simulated runoff from many other tropical rivers and middle latitude rivers are smaller with both positive and negative signs. In middle and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, soil moisture tends to decrease in summer, whereas it increases in winter. However, in many semi-arid regions in subtropical and middle latitudes, soil moisture is reduced during most of a year. These semi-arid regions include the southwestern part of North America, the northeastern part of China in the Northern Hemisphere, and the region in the vicinity of the Kalahari Desert and southern part of Australia in the Southern Hemisphere. Since a semi-arid region usually surrounds a desert, the reduction of soil moisture in such a region often results in the expansion of the desert. Soil moisture is also reduced during the dry season in many semi-arid regions. For example, it is reduced in the savannahs of Africa and South America during winter and early spring in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is reduced at the Mediterranean coast of Europe in summer.

However, modelling results presented here suggest that large-scale tree planting will substantially reduce river flows and impose costs on downstream water users if planted in areas of high runoff yield. Streamflow reductions in the Macquarie River, NSW, Australia are estimated for a number of tree planting scenarios and global warming forecasts. The modelling framework includes the Sacramento rainfall-runoff model and IQQM, a streamflow routing tool, as well as various global climate model outputs from which daily rainfall and potential evaporation data files have been generated in OzClim, a climate scenario generator. For a 10% increase in tree cover in the headwaters of the Macquarie, we estimate a 17% reduction in inflows to Burrendong Dam. The drying trend for a mid-range scenario of regional rainfall and potential evaporation caused by a global warming of 0.5\u00b0C may cause an additional 5% reduction in 2030. These flow reductions will decrease the frequency of bird-breeding events in Macquarie Marshes (a RAMSAR protected wetland) and reduce the security of supply to irrigation areas downstream. Inter-decadal climate variability is predicted to have a very significant influence on catchment hydrologic behaviour. A further 20% reduction in flows from the long-term historical mean is possible, should we move into an extended period of below average rainfall years, such as occurred in eastern Australia between 1890 and 1948.

Negative cloud feedback by itself does not, therefore, preclude the existence of a PEP response to GHG forcing. The climatological PEP does not exhibit an oceanic export of energy from the tropical Pacific, as inferred for the regular El Ni\u00f1o event, but rather an oceanic import of energy. Nevertheless the PEP provides an effective means of regulating climate warming and the energy budget in the tropical Pacific which is accomplished through energy transports out of the region by the atmosphere.

Recent comparative studies, largely carried out on marine ectotherms, indicate that the processes and limits of thermal tolerance are linked with the adjustment of aerobic scope and capacity of the whole animal as a crucial step in thermal adaptation on top of parallel adjustments at the molecular or membrane level. In accordance with Shelford's law of tolerance decreasing whole animal aerobic scope characterises the onset of thermal limitation at low and high pejus thresholds (pejus = getting worse). The drop in aerobic scope of an animal indicated by falling oxygen levels in the body fluids and or the progressively limited capacity of circulatory and ventilatory mechanisms. At high temperatures, excessive oxygen demand causes insufficient oxygen levels in the body fluids, whereas at low temperatures the aerobic capacity of mitochondria may become limiting for ventilation and circulation. Further cooling or warming beyond these limits leads to low or high critical threshold temperatures (T", ") where aerobic scope disappears and transition to an anaerobic mode of mitochondrial metabolism and progressive insufficiency of cellular energy levels occurs. The adjustments of mitochondrial densities and their functional properties appear as a critical process in defining and shifting thermal tolerance windows. The finding of an oxygen limited thermal tolerance owing to loss of aerobic scope is in line with Taylor's and Weibel's concept of symmorphosis, which implies that excess capacity of any component of the oxygen delivery system is avoided. The present study suggests that the capacity of oxygen delivery is set to a level just sufficient to meet maximum oxygen demand between the average highs and lows of environmental temperatures. At more extreme temperatures only time limited passive survival is supported by anaerobic metabolism or the protection of molecular functions by heat shock proteins and antioxidative defence. As a corollary, the first line of thermal sensitivity is due to capacity limitations at a high level of organisational complexity, i.e. the integrated function of the oxygen delivery system, before individual, molecular or membrane functions become disturbed. These interpretations are in line with the more general consideration that, as a result of the high level of complexity of metazoan organisms compared with simple eukaryotes and then prokaryotes, thermal tolerance is reduced in metazoans. A similar sequence of sensitivities prevails within the metazoan organism, with the highest sensitivity at the organismic level and wider tolerance windows at lower levels of complexity. However, the situation is different in that loss in aerobic scope and progressive hypoxia at the organismic level define the onset of thermal limitation which then transfers to lower hierarchical levels and causes cellular and molecular disturbances. Oxygen limitation contributes to oxidative stress and, finally, denaturation or malfunction of molecular repair, e.g. during suspension of protein synthesis. The sequence of thermal tolerance limits turns into a hierarchy, ranging from systemic to cellular to molecular levels. \u00a9 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc."], "title": "Climate variations and the physiological basis of temperature dependent biogeography: Systemic to molecular hierarchy of thermal tolerance in animals"},

Whilst ecohydrological studies have concentrated on the internal functioning of mires, the insights gained are relevant to runoff generation in peat-covered river catchments. This paper reviews our knowledge of processes occurring in mires and relates these to wider catchment hydrology, on the basis of published information and recent research in Scotland. The influence of different types of land management is considered, and it emerges that mire is most effective in delaying storm run-off, in preventing soil erosion and in retaining inorganic nutrients when it is undrained; although there can be adverse effects on water quality under certain conditions. In the context of global warming, mire ecosystems are sensitive but at the same time robust to climate change, and thus contain archives of climatic data for the Holocene. Moreover, peatlands store significant quantities of carbon, and influence directly the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Various issues related to conservation and restoration of peatland biodiversity have been addressed constructively in recent decades, although approaches and objectives are not always consistent between sites.

Soil carbon emission is a major source of uncertainty in estimating the terrestrial carbon budget at the ecosystem level and above. Due to the lack of consideration of the nonlinearity in temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, several commonly used ecosystem models produce substantially different estimates of soil respiration with the same or similar model input. In this paper we demonstrated that the response of soil respiration to changes in temperature sensitivity is nonlinear and, thus, that the oversimplified formulations may significantly reduce the accuracy of ecosystem models in predicting carbon fluxes. To alleviate this problem, we have developed a general model of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration that explicitly considers this nonlinearity. The model was supported by our field measurements from a forest ecosystem, and used to assess the uncertainty in estimating the soil CO", " efflux with several commonly used ecosystem models. Our results indicated that the variations and nonlinearity of the soil respiration-temperature relationship and its dependence on moisture may have important implications for ecosystem carbon modeling at regional and global scales. In other words, 'small causes' may lead to 'large effects' in complex ecosystems in terms of carbon dynamics. In particular, when the variability in temperature sensitivity of soil respiration was incorporated in the several commonly used ecosystem models, the carbon source-sink relationship for terrestrial ecosystems under future global warming scenarios became dramatically different from those reported previously. Thus, we advocate that confidence limits are both necessary and feasible for simulated carbon budget from ecosystem models. Based on field measurements and model simulations, our study provides useful information for computing such confidence limits. In addition, our new model of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration seems more general and yet realistic, and can improve the accuracy of ecosystem models in predicting carbon fluxes at large scales. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the time series of independent surge events (i.e. events separated by at least 1 week) has remained nearly stationary during that period. This suggests that, although the sea level rise (due to global warming and human activity in the region) is leading to more multiple events, the frequency of meteorological conditions that trigger independent events seems to be nearly balancing the effects of sea level change. Such meteorological conditions are identified by compositing sea level pressure (SLP) and 995 hPa wind during and before independent sea surge events in Venice. The composite analysis shows that these correspond to storms orographically induced over the western Mediterranean basin, when an Atlantic synoptic system is perturbed by the Pyrenees and/or the Alps. It is, however, the persistence, intensity and relative position of such storms to the Adriatic Sea that contribute to the optimum conditions for the occurrence of floodings in its northern embayment. It is shown that the synoptic picture is translated into persistent low SLP over the Venice region, negative north-south SLP gradient over the Adriatic, and south-southeasterly to southeasterly wind over the central and northern parts of the sea. During the 40 year period under analysis, the persistence and intensity of the most adverse scenarios for the occurence of sea surges in Venice have been generally decreasing; significant trends have been found in the tails of the distributions of Venice SLP, SLP north-south gradient, and of surface wind over the northern Adriatic.

We illustrate how different scales of data/observation provide different pieces of information that may collectively define the real distributions of a species. We then use sensitivity analyses of energetic models to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of changes in core temperature (fever) global climate (increased air temperature under a global warming scenario) and vegetation cover (deforestation) on winter survival of elk, the geographic distribution of chuckwallas and the activity overlap of predator and prey species within a subset of commonly observed species in a terrestrial food web. Variation in slope and aspect affect the spatial variance in solar radiation incident on the ground, hence ground surface temperature, at the same elevation, same hourly 2 m air temperatures, and wind speeds. We illustrate visually how spatial effects and landscape heterogeneity make statistical descriptions of animal responses problematic, since multiple distributions of their responses to climate, topography, and vegetation on the landscape can yield the same descriptive statistics, especially at high (30 m) resolution.

The persistence data were analyzed for patch area, patch perimeter, patch number, patch coherence, largest patch size, patch fragmentation, pixel contiguity, pixel clustering, and conditional probability of pixel adjacency. We address two questions: (1) Is there a difference in the spatial pattern of long-term NDVI increase in comparison to short-term increase? and (2) Are there differences in the spatial patterns of patches between Eurasia and North America? The results indicate a persistent and spatially extensive and connected greening trend in Eurasia, relative to North America. The regions showing short-term greening in Eurasia show a scattered pattern of spatially remote small patches. In North America the long-term greening pattern is spatially fragmented, and a mixture of short- and long-term NDVI increase is found, unlike in Eurasia.

The barrage has substantially eliminated the probability of tidal flooding, and the residual flood risk now depends upon the ability of the inland bay to provide sufficient storage for river floodwater during periods of high tide. In the course of the feasibility and design studies the actual reduction in flood hazard was not quantified, but the design was carried out against specific combinations of tidal levels and fluvial flows. Recent research for MAFF at HR Wallingford has now made viable the assessment of the actual degree of flood risk, where flooding depends on the combination of two or more events. This paper presents a new joint probability appraisal of the standard of flood defence for the land around the inland bay, and demonstrates the conservatism incorporated in the original design methodology for flood risks. An examination of individual floods and surge tides and of the daily flow and tide records for a concurrent 18-year period has shown no positive correlation between concurrent high tides and river floods. An ISIS flow model of the Rivers Taff and Ely, the inland bay and the operation of the barrage structure was used to identify combinations of hydro-meteorological events that give specific levels in the inland bay. A statistical frequency assessment of these levels in the inland bay has provided 'return periods' for the still water level in the inland bay exceeding, for example, 7\u00b75 m OD and 8\u00b70 m OD. This frequency assessment was undertaken for sea levels with and without an allowance for future rise in mean sea level attributable to global warming. The ISIS modelling contained some conservative assumptions, notably the assumed coincidence between the peak of the river flow and high tide in the Bristol Channel, and the effect of these assumptions was investigated by some sensitivity tests. Finally, a best estimate of the return period for these levels in the inland bay was made using the sensitivity testing and the results of a study in 1994 of the effects of the operation of the barrage. It is concluded that the construction of the barrage is a significant flood defence benefit to Cardiff, which now has greater protection from flooding from the inland bay than the Thames Barrier provides for London. Flood risk from impoundment of the inland bay for the waterfront area remains very low even for the currently used scenarios for mean sea level rise due to global warming to the year 2100."], "title": "A new joint probability appraisal of flood risk"},

In all cases, neurolipofuscin accumulation rate is positively correlated with environmental temperature but there appears to be lowered sensitivity in the thermal mid-range, an 'optimum' temperature for neurolipofuscin accumulation and possibly age-associated variation. The geographical position of the population within the species' thermal range may determine sensitivity of the response. There is seasonal oscillation of neurolipofuscin accumulation rate, providing preliminary evidence for neurolipofuscin turnover with net loss in winter. Spatial and temporal thermal variations of similar magnitude appear to have comparable effects on neurolipofuscin accumulation rate. Such effects may be extreme, suggesting important implications for physiological aging even in homeotherms. Inter-specific comparisons indicate that species-specific neurolipofuscin accumulation rates are positively correlated with habitat temperature and inversely correlated with maximum lifespan and age at maturity.

Location: This study was conducted on North Brother Island, Cook Strait, New Zealand. This 4-ha island supports the sole remnant population of S. guntheri. Methods: Demographic variables were estimated using capture-recapture methods. Tuatara were individually marked and recaptured during twelve trips, spanning a decade. Population size was estimated for selected trips using the CAPTURE package and finite mixture models, and survival was analysed using the Jolly-Seber (J-S) model. Longevity was estimated using tuatara individually marked in 1957. Results: Approximately 350 adult tuatara profile likelihood interval (PLI) (294-427) inhabit North Brother Island, and the sex ratio is strongly biased towards males (1.7M: 1F). Annual adult survivorship is high (0.95) for both sexes and some tuatara live for at least 61 years. Main conclusions: The small size and biased sex ratio of this population may make it susceptible to demographic stochasticity, Allee effects, and/or loss of genetic variation. Harvesting for translocation could exacerbate such problems. In addition, tuatara have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), with males produced at higher incubation temperatures.

It has been found that the regional change in tropical cyclone frequency is closely related to the distribution of the SST anomaly, and the change in convective activity associated with it. The results of the experiment indicate that the change in tropical cyclogenesis is strongly controlled by dynamical factors associated with the change in SST distribution, rather than the thermodynamical factors associated with the change in absolute value of local SST.

This research modeled a species invasion by examining the interaction between a quantitative genetic trait and population density. It assumed: (1) a quantitative genetic trait describes the adaptation of an individual to its local ecological conditions; (2) populations far from the local optimum grow more slowly than those near the optimum; and (3) the evolution of a trait depends on local population density, because differences in local population densities cause asymmetrical gene flow. This genetics-density interaction determined the propagation speed of populations. Numerical simulations showed that populations spread by advancing as two synchronic traveling waves, one for population density and one for trait adaptation. The form of the density wave was a step front that advances homogenizing populations at their carrying capacity; the adaptation wave was a curve with finite slope that homogenizes populations at full adaptation. The largest speed of population expansion, for a dimensionless analysis, corresponded to an almost homogeneous spatial environment when this model approached an ecological description such as the Fisher-Skellam's model. A large genetic response also favored faster speeds. Evolutionary speeds, in a natural scale, showed a wide range of rates that were also slower compared to models that only consider demographics. This evolutionary speed increased with high heritability, strong stabilizing selection, and high intrinsic growth rate. It decreased for steeper environmental gradients. Also indicated was an optimal dispersal rate over which evolutionary speed declined. This is expected because dispersal moves individuals further, but homogenizes populations genetically, making them maladapted. The evolutionary speed was compared to observed data.

The GAM model failed to produce a viable model for differences in EOS, probably because it is dominated by photoperiod controls with only a minor temperature impact. SOS differences were predicted with an accuracy of about 2.4 days, with a GAM consisting of smoothed functions of mean annual average temperature, urban fractional cover, and the urban vs DBF greenness amplitude difference.

Location. The four target species (Rhododendron arboreum Sm., R. campanulatum D. Don, R. barbatum Wall., and R. wallichi Sm.) are common evergreen broad-leaved trees in the central Himalayas. Their realized niches are based on data from the elevation-temperature gradient in Nepal (1000-5000 m a.s.l.). The ex-situ data are from botanical gardens and arboreta mainly located in the northern hemisphere (n = 43). Methods. Binary data on these taxa were obtained from 707 geocoded herbarium specimens (elevation and UTM location) and from two elevation transects in Nepal (n = 194 plots). Climate conditions from ex-situ locations for each taxon were compared with their realized climate ranges with respect to (i) mean annual temperature (MAT), (ii) mean minimum temperature of the coldest month (MINCM), (iii) mean maximum temperature of the warmest month (MAXWM), and (iv) moisture index (MI). Realized optima were estimated by Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and its non-parametric extension, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), were used to estimate the realized niches. Results. All target species have ex-situ individuals outside the realized climate niche, but the number is much higher for maximum and minimum variables than for MAT. The most dominant species (in-situ), R. arboreum, had very few individuals outside its realized range, indicating congruence between its ex-situ and realized niches. The other taxa had many individuals outside the warm end of their realized temperature ranges, but almost none beyond the cold end of their ranges. All target taxa occur in common gardens under warm temperate conditions, but only R. arboreum grows in the warm temperate zone in the Himalayas. This trend at the warm end of the gradient is interpreted as a result of biotic exclusion. Main conclusion. The results demonstrate that an extreme cold temperature may represent an absolute boundary for tree species' survival, whereas warm temperatures do not. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that several tree species may survive global warming in-situ because of high temperature tolerance, but its effect on regeneration is uncertain. In lieu of this there may be a significant time lag between change in climate and transient tree species distribution. Thus the effect of global warming on tree species distribution may be very difficult to predict."], "title": "Realized and potential climate niches: A comparison of four Rhododendron tree species"},

Most of the TOC concentrations in the percolate ranged from 0.5 to 6.0 mg/L with the corn/soybean-rye rotation. Developed springs in two rotational grazing systems were sampled for 10 years. TOC concentrations in the groundwater from the springflow developments had less variability than in the lysimeter percolate.

However, only short-term benefits of intensification were realized and consumers started to select animal produce from less intensive production systems in the belief that it would be healthier, kinder to the animals and less likely to cause damage to the environment. Recent research has shown that the production of high quality traditional dairy products will provide an income for more people than intensive dairy production, thus helping to serve as a functional basis for rural land use. It is often argued that extensive production cannot produce enough food for the majority of the population, but such estimates rely on outdated and inadequate levels of output from the traditional systems. Modern organic dairy systems, for example, should produce at least two-thirds of that of intensive systems and should therefore be able to provide for the majority of consumers in the UK. However, it is anticipated that increased global trade in livestock products will further threaten the livelihood of UK producers. Their options are to reduce input costs and develop specialized markets for high quality products ahead of their competitors. For example, the increased potential lifespan of the human population will encourage people to consume products that promote longevity, such as those with minimal contamination by pollutants. In many parts of the world, but particularly in the central continental land masses, livestock production will be challenged by global warming. Traditional production systems are likely to survive better, as they are buffered against variations in weather. It is concluded that livestock production systems have the potential to provide high quality food and employment, especially in marginal areas, and to preserve the land for the benefit of future generations.

Studies have shown that many adult and immature insects are able to maintain body temperature well above, and often independently of, ambient temperature in the presence of direct solar radiation. They may do so directly by basking, or indirectly via microhabitat choice. The implications for this are often ignored in development models that serve to predict species' responses to climate change. 2. To investigate the difference in development times attributable to solar input, field development of Aglais urticae, Inachis io and Polygonia c-album larvae (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was followed both in a natural open situation and in an artificially shaded environment. Each species completed development more quickly in the open, equivalent to a 20%, 10% and 15% reduction in development time, respectively. 3. Observed development times in the artificially shaded environment were used to compare the techniques of rate summation and degree-day modelling. Rate summation models were found to describe development in the shade best for A. urticae and I. io, although a degree-day model performed best for P. c-album, possible reasons for which are discussed. The best-performing models for each species were modified to include larval thermoregulation data, assuming a linear relationship between body and ambient temperatures during the measured sunshine hours each day, and tested against observed development times in the open situation. Times for 50% adult emergence were predicted exactly for A. urticae, and to an accuracy of 1 day for I. io and 5 days for P. c-album. 4. The models were tested further using climate data from 128 UK Meteorological Office weather stations across England, Wales and Scotland. Thermoregulation model predictions matched observed UK distribution and voltinism better than predictions made by the standard unmodified models. It was estimated that larval thermoregulation allows A. urticae and I. io populations to persist approximately 200 km further north than would otherwise be possible, and that the extent of bivoltinism may be shifted northwards by around 300 km. 5. These results have significant implications for predicting the effects of global warming on insects' geographical ranges, the potential distributions of invasive species, and the phenology and voltinism of introduced biocontrol agents as one component of their likely success."], "title": "The influence of thermal ecology on the distribution of three nymphalid butterflies"},

Although a reduction in the Atlantic Ocean circulation appears to be a robust result, the question remains open whether the climate system could possibly cross a critical threshold leading to a complete shutdown of the North Atlantic deep-water formation. Ensemble simulations with an ocean-atmosphere climate model of reduced complexity are performed to investigate the range of possible future climate evolutions when the climate system is close to such a threshold. It is found that the sensitivity of the ocean circulation to perturbations increases rapidly when approaching the bifurcation point, thereby severely limiting the predictability of future climate. At the bifurcation point, different response types such as linear responses, nonlinear transitions, or resonance behavior are observed. Close to the threshold, thermohaline shutdowns can occur thousands of years after the warming has stopped. A characterization of the probability for the different response types reveals a more complex picture for the future evolution of the ocean circulation than previously assumed.

The simulated SOC storage in the top 30 cm within the LEF is highly variable, ranging from approximately 20-230 Mg/ha. The rates of decomposition were especially sensitive to changes in elevation. Carbon release rates due to decomposition were close to carbon assimilation rates and ranged from 0.6-0.96 Mg/ha per year at high elevations to 1.2-1.68 Mg/ha per year at lower elevations. Our simulations indicated that differences in elevation affect decomposition and SOC content primarily by changing microclimate.

The severity, frequency occurrence and spatial scale of hypoxia have increased in the last few decades. Due to rapid human population growth and global warming, the problem of hypoxia is likely to become worse in the coming years. Molecular responses of marine animals to hypoxia are poorly known. In many animals, a haem protein probably serves as the cellular sensor for oxygen, and reactive oxygen species are generated as signaling molecules. In mammal and fish, a heterodimeric transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has been identified. HIF-1 receives signals from the molecular oxygen senor through redox reactions and/or phosphorylation, and in turn, regulates the transcription of a number of hypoxia-inducible genes, including genes involved in erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and glycolysis. These molecular responses then cascade into a series of biochemical and physiological adjustments, enabling the animal to survive better under hypoxic conditions. Marine animals respond to hypoxia by first attempting to maintain oxygen delivery (e.g. increases in respiration rate, number of red blood cells, or oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin), then by conserving energy (e.g. metabolic depression, down regulation of protein synthesis and down regulation/modification of certain regulatory enzymes). Upon exposure to prolonged hypoxia, animals must eventually resort to anaerobic respiration. Hypoxia reduces growth and feeding, which may eventually affect individual fitness. Effects of hypoxia on reproduction and development of marine animals, albeit important in affecting species survival, remain almost unknown. Many fish and marine organisms can detect, and actively avoid hypoxia. Some benthos may leave their burrows and move to sediment surface during hypoxia. These behaviorial changes may render the animals more vulnerable to predation. Hypoxia may eliminate sensitive species, thereby causing major changes in species composition of benthic, fish and phytoplankton communities. Decreases in species diversity and species richness are well documented, and changes in trophodynamics and functional groups have also been reported. Under hypoxic conditions, there is a general tendency for suspended feeders to be replaced by deposit feeders; demersal fish by pelagic fish; and macrobenthos by meiobenthos. Microflagellates and nanoplankton also tend to dominate in the phytoplankton community in hypoxic environments. Existing evidence suggest that recovery of benthic communities in temperate region take two to several years. Recovery however, appears to be much quicker in subtropical environments. In natural conditions, hypoxia is often associated with increases in ammonia, hydrogen sulphide and particulate organic materials. The inability to isolate effects of hypoxia from interactions of these compounding factors makes it difficult to attribute many of the observed ecological effects to hypoxia. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To examine the multicentury impact of protracted global warming on oceanic concentrations of dissolved oxygen, we use a climate system model and a low-order oceanic biogeochemical model. The models are integrated for an atmospheric equivalent CO", " concentration, which is specified to triple according to a standard scenario from the late nineteenth to the late twenty-first century, and then is subsequently held constant at that elevated level for an additional 6 centuries. For the present day, the model successfully reproduced the large-scale features of the dissolved oxygen field in the ocean. In the global warming simulation, the physical model displays marked changes in high-latitude oceanic stratification and overturning, including near-cessation of deep water renewal for depths greater than about 1.5 km during the period of elevated stable CO", " concentration. Our model predicts a decline in oxygen concentration through most of the subsurface ocean. Concentration changes in the thermocline waters result mainly from solubility changes in the upstream source waters, while changes in the deep waters result mainly from lack of ventilation and ongoing consumption of oxygen by remineralization of sinking particulate organic matter. Changes in the upper 2 km of the ocean generally show signs of equilibration by the end of the integration, but at greater depths, there occurs a slow but steady decline through to the end of the integration. By the end of the integration, we simulate a doubling of the volume of hypoxic water (less than 10 \u03bcmol/kg) in the thermocline of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. During the integration deep ocean oxygen concentrations generally decline by between 20 and 40%, but, significantly, no extensive deep ocean anoxia develops during the period of integration, nor does it appear that it would likely do so for at least a further 4000 years of integration. Subsurface oxygen decline is moderated by an overall reduction in export production of particulate organic matter, which reduces oxygen consumption in the ocean interior due to the remineralization of this material.

We assessed the effects of simulated climatic warming and atmospheric CO", " enrichment on the spring and autumn phenology of maple trees (Acer rubrum and A. saccharum) growing for four years in open-top field chambers. CO", " enrichment ( + 300 ppm) had no consistent effects on the timing of budbreak and leaf unfolding in the spring or leaf abscission in the autumn. Warming (+ 4 \u00b0C) usually had predictable effects: in two of the three years of assessment, budbreak occurred earlier in warm chambers than in ambient temperature chambers, and leaf abscission always occurred later. The lengthening of the growing season could contribute to increased productivity, although effects of temperature on other physiological processes can concurrently have negative effects on productivity. In 1995, budbreak was unexpectedly delayed in the warmer chambers, apparently the result of advanced budbreak leading to injury from a late-spring frost.

This report presents the results of a preliminary study that uses cesium-137 dating and down-core measurements of sediment bulk density to numerically model vertical accretion, shallow autocompaction and surface elevation change. The models produce vertical accretion rates that are comparable to rates derived from artificial marker horizons, and long-term surface elevation changes that are in close agreement with sedimentation rates based on cesium-137 dating of well-compacted sediment. The model results suggest that average annual vertical accretion may be higher than average annual surface elevation change by a factor of 1.6 to 21. Sedimentation rates derived from cesium-137 dating also are higher than average annual surface elevation change by a factor of 1.1 to 4.7.

Furthermore, increasing evidence of decrease in snow cover and retreat of glaciers due to global warming have been reported from various parts of the HKH, which has serious implications for low flow in the region. However, reliable methods for low flow are difficult to find and lack of hydrometeorological data have inhibited the development of such methods. This has posed serious problems for sustainable management of water resources systems in the region in view of the difficulties in low flow. This paper also discusses a method for low flow estimation in the mountainous regions of Nepal, which shares with other neighbouring areas the complexity in the nature of the terrain and climate, inadequate hydro-meteorological network and insufficient long-term reliable data on hydrometeorology. The method discussed is based on a method developed in the UK, for estimating the hydrological regime at ungauged sites. Regionalization of the flow has been developed applying multi-variate regression analysis of long-term hydro-meteorological data and catchment characteristics. A number of standardised flow duration type curves have been determined, and regression models of the flows and the topographical and geological characteristics of the catchments were established. The mean flow was estimated using the water balance principle where the long-term mean annual runoff is the difference between long-term average annual precipitation and long-term actual evapotranspiration. Regionalization has been carried out by developing grids of hydrological response. The grids allow the flow regime to be estimated at any point on any stream in the mountainous region of the country. This is the first regional method of this kind to be developed to estimate low flows from ungauged catchments in Nepal. Such a method is of great importance for Nepal as well as for the mountainous regions of other countries of the HKH region, as it allows assessment of water availability for the design of small hydropower, irrigation and water supply schemes, and contributes to the economic development and poverty alleviation. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examine temperature-induced effects on reproductive output (eggs m", "), onset of spawning (day of the year), and the juvenile instantaneous mortality rate (per day) of M. balthica. Data analysis was based on an extensive long-term data set (1973-2001) originating from the western Wadden Sea.

It is hypothesized that the observed density-dependent mortality of juvenile bivalves may act via competition for food, a behavioral response of shrimp to low spat densities, or be the result of the response of age and size at metamorphosis of marine bivalves to resource variability. It is to be expected that prolonged periods of lowered bivalve recruitment and stocks will lead to a reformulation of estuarine food webs and possibly a reduction of the resilience of the system to additional disturbances, such as the depletion and disturbance by shellfish fisheries."], "title": "Climate-related changes in recruitment of the bivalve Macoma balthica"},

This resulted in a redistribution of the contributions of large industrial source regions to the content of anthropogenic microelements in the Arctic atmospheric aerosol. Moreover, during the processes of purifying the Arctic atmosphere, the importance of pollutant precipitation onto the underlying surface was increased, and the importance of pollutant removal by air masses outside the Arctic region was decreased. This resulted in variations in the mean atmospheric concentrations and fluxes of a number of heavy metals and other toxic microelements onto the underlying surface. In particular, during spring, the mean concentrations of anthropogenic constituents in the aerosol over the central region of the Russian Arctic decreased gradually only because of changes in the processes of atmospheric circulation. If a decrease of the intensity of anthropogenic emissions occurring in Europe and in the industrial regions of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s is taken into account, the annual average fluxes of anthropogenic pollutants onto the underlying surface of the Arctic had to also have been decreased at the end of the last century. On the whole, in the Northern Hemisphere, global warming must gradually decrease the efficiency of transport of anthropogenic pollutants by air masses from large industrial regions to the Arctic and, thus, decrease the importance of the atmosphere as a channel through which pollutants enter the Arctic region. \u00a9 2003 by MAIK \"Nauka/Interperiodica\" (Russia)."], "title": "Long-term variations in the processes of polluting the Arctic atmosphere"},

Using thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), we have determined 48 ", "Th-", "U-", "U ages of small (10-40 mg) samples from pedogenic carbonate rinds on clasts in the terrace deposits. Based on textural, microstratigraphic and geochemical criteria, we conclude that the U-series ages of innermost-rind samples provide reliable ages of 16.4\u00b11.9 ka for terrace I, and 233.1\u00b19.3 ka for terrace II. This constrains the average rate of vertical displacement along the normal fault to be 0.079\u00b10.011 mm/yr during the past \u223c16 kyr, and 0.064\u00b10.007 mm/yr during the past \u223c233 kyr. Combining these results with slip-rate estimates for other normal faults along the graben margins indicates that the cumulative vertical displacement on all normal faults did not exceed \u223c0.3 mm/yr during the late Quaternary. This new rate from central Tibet is distinctly lower than the rate of 1.9\u00b10.6 mm/yr inferred for normal faults bounding the Yadong-Gulu graben system in southern Tibet, consistent with more pronounced and common graben development in southern Tibet. We therefore suggest that normal faulting in southern Tibet is largely controlled by local processes, and that the age of its initiation is not a valid proxy for uplift of the Tibetan plateau, as has been widely assumed. Our data also place chronologic constraints on the termination of periglacial conditions in central Tibet during the last three interglaciations. Rind formation appears to have been relatively continuous on clasts in terrace I from \u223c16 ka. Clast rinds from terrace II, in contrast, are characterized by three main episodes of rind growth that are widely separated in time. The earliest and least well-preserved episode started at 233.1\u00b19.3 ka, a second episode occurred at 131.8\u00b17.8 ka, and a third episode was approximately coeval with rind formation in terrace I after 16.4\u00b11.9 ka. In each case, the age of onset of carbonate rind accumulation coincides with independently estimated ages of global deglaciation. Accordingly, we conclude that periglacial conditions in the central Tibetan plateau terminated synchronously with early stages of global warming following the last three glacial maxima, and that fluvial aggradation, terrace formation, and pedogenic carbonate accumulation in terrace soils ensued rapidly. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The main characteristic of summer precipitation in China is a drying trend in the north and a wetting trend in the central part. The precipitation in winter shows an increasing trend in southern and eastern-central China. Interesting features have also been found in the transitional seasons. In spring, precipitation variations are almost opposite to those in summer. In autumn the precipitation decreases in almost the whole country except for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley. In addition, the seasonality of precipitation has become slightly weaker in recent decades in southern and eastern China. Pronounced warming is observed in the entire country in winter, spring, and autumn, particularly in the northern part of China. In summer a cooling trend in central China is particularly interesting, and cooling (warming) trends generally coexist with wetting (drying) trends. The correlativity between precipitation and temperature variations is weak in spring, autumn, and winter. It has also been found that the long-term climate variations in winter and summer in China may be connected to the warming trend in the sea surface temperature of the Indian Ocean. A comparison between the observed seasonal climate variations and the CMIP2 simulations of 16 models indicates that the observed long-term variations of winter, spring, and autumn temperature in China may be associated with increases in greenhouse gas concentrations.

In the empirical models, large-scale T was applied as a predictor for T. For R, both T and sea-level pressure (SLP) were applied as predictors during most of the year, while only SLP was applied during summer. The dynamical model, HIRHAM, is a regional climate model based upon HIRLAM, but with physical parametrisations from ECHAM4/OPYC3. Both approaches project from 1980-1999 to 2030-2049 an increase in annual mean temperatures of between 1 and 2.5\u00b0C in various parts of the country. The projected warming is at a minimum along the southern coast, while greater warming is projected inland and in the north. Though the differences between the approaches are not statistically significant, empirical downscaling systematically leads to a larger projected increase in annual mean temperature than dynamical downscaling does. The difference is at a maximum during winter and/or spring at localities exposed to temperature inversions. Empirical downscaling projects larger winter warming in inland valleys than at more freely exposed localities, and thus implies a reduced intensity or frequency of winter inversions. It is argued that less favourable conditions for ground inversions are consistent with the future projection of increased winter wind speeds and reduced snow-cover. For precipitation, both downscaling approaches project a statistically significant increase in the west during autumn, and in the south during winter. The only significant difference between the results is that dynamical downscaling projects increased summer precipitation in the southwest, while the empirically downscaled scenario shows no significant change. For summer precipitation the present empirical models do not include any predictor carrying the 'climate change signal', and thus the results from the dynamical downscaling are probably more realistic concerning summer precipitation."], "title": "Temperature and precipitation scenarios for Norway: Comparison of results from dynamical and empirical downscaling"},

I examine this technique, known as pattern scaling, using a particular GCM (HadCM2).The critical assumption is that there is a linear relationship between the scaler (annual global-mean temperature) and the response pattern. Previous studies have found this assumption to be broadly valid for annual temperature; I extend this conclusion to precipitation and seasonal (JJA) climate. However, slight non-linearities arise from the dependence of the climatic response on the rate, not just the amount, of change in the scaler. These non-linearities introduce some significant errors into the estimates made by pattern scaling, but nonetheless the estimates accurately represent the modelled changes. A response pattern may be made more robust by lengthening the period from which it is obtained, by anomalising it relative to the control simulation, and by using least squares regression to obtain it.

This spatial framework allowed us to test (1) for differences among treelines affected by different types of local disturbance and (2) the traditional hypothesis that low temperature limits treeline. Contingency tables and ANOVA showed that local disturbance occurred more frequently than expected on slopes with cool aspects, steep slope angles and concave slope configuration. Disturbed treelines were locally lowered with longer ecotones and lower krummholz growth rates and vegetation cover than undisturbed treelines. Three-way ANOVA showed the significant influences of study area (regional climate) and aspect (local climate) on treeline elevation, krummholz growth rates and density, tree density and vegetation cover, while accounting for local disturbance. Treeline elevations were higher east of the Andes reflecting the more continental climate in Argentina than in Chile, plus regional impacts of volcanic eruptions. Tree density and vegetation cover were greater west of the Andes reflecting greater precipitation in Chile. Within study areas, local climate had different influences on treeline elevations and krummholz growth rates west and east of the Andes. We predict that increased tree growth and upslope advance of treeline in response to global warming is more likely in Chile than in Argentina near 40\u00b0 S, unless precipitation increases east of the Andes. To test these predictions, we recommend research be stratified to account for the influences of local disturbance, which may confound climatic impacts. In northern Patagonia, suitable control (undisturbed) study sites will most likely be found at upper slope positions with low slope angles, simple microtopography and straight topographic configuration."], "title": "Regional and local effects of disturbance and climate on altitudinal treelines in northern Patagonia"},

Federal relief payments for major events have escalated partly as a result of insufficient data to detect and understand society's changing vulnerability to extremes. Controversies over relief payments for major damaging events have occurred as a result of imprecise loss estimates. The insurance industry suffered major storm-related losses in the 1990s because it lacked a database on weather-produced losses and was unable to anticipate time-shifting risks in setting rates. The absence of quality impact data has also led to questionable research priorities, and has generated incorrect perceptions in the public and media about the magnitude of impacts of events. The lack of precise loss values also limits adequate planning for future impacts, which is apt to lead to increased losses as society's vulnerability to extremes continues to increase. Recent pressures, including several major weather losses since 1988, and concern over the impacts of more extremes due to global warming, have led to better estimates of impacts. These pressures and government and insurance industry recognition of the need to better understand the ever-increasing costs have led to recent national assessments, calling for better impact data. The nation needs a continuing program to adequately measure losses from natural hazards and to maintain a quality database to guide government policies and private sector actions."], "title": "Measures of Economic Impacts of Weather Extremes: Getting Better but Far from What is Needed - A Call for Action"},

A significant \"Hydrogen Economy\" is predicted that will reduce dependence on petroleum imports, and reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Such a hydrogen economy will need significant new sources of hydrogen. Virtually all our current hydrogen is produced from natural gas and is equivalent to 48 GW(t). Replacing this growing demand with a non-fossil, non-greenhouse gas emitting source represents a huge potential market for fusion. Hydrogen could potentially be produced from water using fusion energy by direct interaction of fusion products (charged particles, neutrons and gammas), and by electrolytic or thermochemical means. Significant effort was devoted to study of these possibilities in the 1970-80s. It is instructive to review these earlier studies today as interest in production of hydrogen is revived. Investigations into direct use of fusion products for radiolysis and \"hot spot\" chemistry found it was difficult to get much of the fusion energy into the reaction channels of interest. Use of fusion energy in heat-driven processes was more promising. Fusion blankets could give much higher temperatures than are possible from fission heat sources. Studies of high temperature electrolysis and thermochemical water splitting using this high temperature heat were promising. The requirement that fusion blankets breed tritium raises challenges, as the tolerance for tritium in the product hydrogen is extraordinarily low. Use of multiple coolant streams, multiple containment barriers and separate breeding and high temperature zones were proposed that appear to successfully address these concerns, but add complication. Fusion does have the potential to support the Hydrogen Economy as well as electricity production as long as care is given to maximizing the benefits and minimizing the liabilities inherent to fusion energy."], "title": "Production of hydrogen by fusion energy: A review and perspective"},

A parameterization to account for the uncertainty in the future carbon cycle is introduced, derived separately from a carbon cycle model. This allows us to quantify the effect of the feedback between oceanic and terrestrial carbon uptake and global warming on global temperature projections. Finally, probability density functions for the surface warming until year 2100 for two illustrative emission scenarios are calculated, taking into account uncertainties in the carbon cycle, radiative forcing, climate sensitivity, model parameters and the observed temperature records.

The computational efficiency of the model allows an extensive and thorough study of the causes of changes in the strength of the thermohaline circulation, through a large number of extended runs. The evolution of the atmosphere-to-ocean surface heat fluxes is shown to be the dominant factor in causing the weakening of the circulation in response to an increasing external forcing as well as in controlling the subsequent recovery. The feedback between heat flux and the sea surface temperature is necessary for the ocean circulation to recover. The rate of the recovery, however, is not sensitive to the magnitude of the feedback, and changes in the atmosphere, while contributing to the recovery, play a secondary role. In the case of very strong feedback, substantial changes in the SST structure are shown not to be a necessary condition for the recovery of the circulation. Subsurface changes in the density structure accompany recovery despite nearly fixed SST in one of the uncoupled experiments. Changes in the zonal distribution of heat fluxes serve as a positive feedback for both decrease and recovery of the meridional overturning, and are as important as changes in the zonal-mean values of heat fluxes. The secondary role of the moisture fluxes is explained by a smaller magnitude of their contribution to the surface buoyancy flux. Imposing amplified changes in the moisture fluxes leads to a significant slow down of the circulation, accompanied, however, by changes in the heat flux. The changed heat flux, in its turn, makes a significant contribution to the future slow down.

In addition, species with a variable rather than a fixed number of broods per year have delayed passage, possibly because they are free to attempt more broods.

The current evidence for the different therapies has many limitations due to lack of sufficient studies on the different Leishmania species with differing virulence. So far there is no international gold standard for the optimal management. The aim of the German joint working group on Leishmaniasis, formed by the societies of Tropical Medicine (DTG), Chemotherapy (PEG) and Dermatology (DDG), was to establish a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of CL and MCL in Germany, based on evidence (Medline search yielded 400 articles) and, where lacking, on consensus of the experts. As the clinical features do not necessarily reflect the involved Leishmania species and, as different parasite species and even geographically distinct strains of the same species may require different treatments or varying dosagesor durations of therapy, the guidelines suggest for Germany to identify the underlying parasite prior to treatment. Because of relevant differences in prognosis and ensuing therapy species should be identified in i) New World CL/MCL (NWCL/ MCL) to distinguish between L. mexicana-complex and subgenus Viannia, ii) in suspected infections with L. mexicana-complex to distinguish from L. amazonensis, and iii) in Old World CL (OWCL) to distinguish between L. infantum and L. major, L. tropica, or L. aethiopica.

A critical appraisal of surface air temperature from station records is presented for southern South America during the 20th century. For the interval 1930-1990, three major patterns in temperature trends are identified. Stations along the Pacific coast between 37 and 43\u00b0S are characterized by negative trends in mean annual temperature with a marked cooling period from 1950 to the mid-1970s. A clear warming trend is observed in the southern stations (south of 46\u00b0S), which intensifies at higher latitudes. No temperature trends are detected for the stations on the Atlantic coast north of 45\u00b0 S. In contrast to higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere where annual changes in temperature are dominated by winter trends, both positive and negative trends in southern South America are due to mostly changes in summer (December to February) temperatures. Changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) around 1976 are felt in summer temperatures at most stations in the Pacific domain, starting a period with increased temperature across the southern Andes and at higher latitudes. Tree-ring records from upper-treeline were used to reconstruct past temperature fluctuations for the two dominant patterns over the southern Andes. These reconstructions extend back to 1640 and are based on composite tree-ring chronologies that were processed to retain as much low-frequency variance as possible. The resulting reconstructions for the northern and southern sectors of the southern Andes explain 55% and 45% of the temperature variance over the interval 1930-1989, respectively. Cross-spectral analysis of actual and reconstructed temperatures over the common interval 1930-1989, indicates that most of the explained variance is at periods > 10 years in length. At periods > 15 years, the squared coherency between actual and reconstructed temperatures ranges between 0.6 and 0.95 for both reconstructions. Consequently, these reconstructions are especially useful for studying multi-decennial temperature variations in the South American sector of the Southern Hemisphere over the past 360 years. As a result, it is possible to show that the temperatures during the 20th century have been anomalously warm across the southern Andes. The mean annual temperatures for the northern and southern sectors during the interval 1900-1990 are 0.53\u00b0C and 0.86\u00b0C above the 1640-1899 means, respectively. These findings placed the current warming in a longer historical perspective, and add new support for the existence of unprecedented 20th century warming over much of the globe. The rate of temperature increase from 1850 to 1920 was the highest over the past 360 years, a common feature observed in several proxy records from higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Local temperature regimes are affected by changes in planetary circulation, with in turn are linked to global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Therefore, we explored how temperature variations in the southern Andes since 1856 are related to large-scale SSTs on the South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. Spatial correlation patterns between the reconstructions and SSTs show that temperature variations in the northern sector of the southern Andes are strongly connected with SST anomalies in the tropical and subtropical Pacific. This spatial correlation pattern resembles the spatial signature of the PDO mode of SST variability over the South Pacific and is connected with the Pacific-South American (PSA) atmospheric pattern in the Southern Hemisphere. In contrast, temperature variations in the southern sector of the southern Andes are significantly correlated with SST anomalies over most of the South Atlantic, and in less degree, over the subtropical Pacific. This spatial correlation field regressed against SST resembles the 'Global Warming' mode of SST variability, which in turn, is linked to the leading mode of circulation in the Southern Hemisphere.

Stable isotopes of individual species mark a rapid increase in temperature and a reduction in the vertical water mass stratification that is accompanied by a decrease in niche habitats, reduced species diversity and/or abundance, smaller species morphologies or dwarfing, and reduced photosymbiotic activity. During the warm event, the relative abundance of a large number of species decreased, including tropical-subtropical affiliated species, whereas typical mid-latitude species retained high abundances. This indicates that climate warming did not create favorable conditions for all tropical-subtropical species at mid-latitudes and did not cause a massive retreat in the local mid-latitude population. A noticeable exception is the ecological generalist Heterohelix dentata Stenestad that dominated during the cool intervals, but significantly decreased during the warm event. However, dwarfing is the most striking response to the abrupt warming and occurred in various species of different morphologies and lineages (e.g. biserial, trochospiral, keeled globotruncanids).

The equivalent amounts of CO ", " and sulfate aerosol concentrations at about the year 2050 as used in the GFDL R15 model are prescribed. First, the performance of the high-resolution AGCM (T106) in reproducing the extratropical cyclone activity of both hemispheres in the control run is examined-by comparing the cyclone activities simulated in the AGCM and those analyzed from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data of the same period from 1979 to 1998. An objective cyclone identification and tracking algorithm is used to analyze the cyclone activity. The results show that the model can reproduce the cyclone activity reasonably well. Second, the possible change in cyclone activity due to enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols is examined. The main results are summarized as follows. 1) The total cyclone density (number of cyclones in a 4.5\u00b0 x 4.5\u00b0 area per season) tends to decrease significantly in the midlatitudes of both of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres during the December-January-February (DJF) and June-July-August (JJA) seasons. The decrease of cyclone density in the midlatitudes of both of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the DJF season is about 7%. In the JJA season, the decreases of cyclone density in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres' midlatitudes are about 3% and 10%, respectively. 2) Although weak and medium-strength cyclones decrease, the density of strong cyclones increases by more than 20% in the Northern Hemisphere in JJA and in the Southern Hemisphere in both DJF and JJA. 3) The density of strong cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere summer (JJA) increases over the eastern coasts of Asia and North America. In the Southern Hemisphere, the density of strong cyclones increases over the circumpolar regions around Antarctica in both summer (DJF) and winter (JJA) seasons. The density of strong cyclones also increase over the southeastern coasts of South Africa and South America. Finally, the possible reasons for the change in cyclone activity due to enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols are examined. It is shown that the changes in the extratropical cyclone activity are closely linked to the changes in the baroclinicity in the lower troposphere, which are mainly related to the changes in the horizontal and vertical temperature distributions in the atmosphere due to enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. It is shown that, in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes, the decrease of baroclinicity is mainly caused by the decrease of meridional temperature gradient, while in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes, the decrease of baroclinicity is mainly caused by the increase of static stability caused by the enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols."], "title": "Possible change of extratropical cyclone activity due to enhanced greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols - Study with a high-resolution AGCM"},

The intricate trend of this process is reconstructed and illustrated by schematic paleoclimatic maps. Warming in the second half of the Sakmarian Age resulted in a rapid degradation of huge glacial belt to the polar glacial cap. By the Kazanian Age, the latter was gradually replaced by the high-latitude temperate-cold belt with retained and new glacial centers that intermittently widened. In the Tatarian Age, a similar temperate-cold belt appeared in the Northern Hemisphere as well. The next strong and sudden global warming occurred in the Permian-Triassic boundary period when the temperate-warm climate developed in high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and temperate one in the Southern Hemisphere. General warming complicated by frequent different-rank oscillations transformed the climatic zoning on the Earth and resulted in rapid global ecological changes. Huge dimensions of Pangea and mountainous belts and ridges at its margins primordially determined wide development of the semiarid and arid climate in low latitudes. During the Late Permian-initial Triassic period, the aridity of the Earth was increasing that is evident from successive widening of arid and semiarid belts of Pangea, which advanced toward middle latitudes, and from grown aridity in the equatorial mountainous belt and in tropical latitudes of the Tethys. Global warming was main factor responsible for stepwise widening of arid and semiarid belts. Another cause of aridity increase was gradual regression of inner seas. Arid and semiarid belts occupied about 40% of land at the beginning of the Early Permian, 55% in the late Sakmarian-early Artinskian time, and 80% in the Induan Age. Paleoclimatic reconstructions confirm the assumed significance of monsoons impact on the climate development in the Permian and Early Triassic to a certain extent only. During glacial periods, the climatic asymmetry of the Earth was particularly remarkable. Registered environmental changes of the Permian time (regressions, aridity growth, land elevation, orogeny, and island-arc volcanism) could result only in cooling. Warming of terminal Permian-Early Triassic, as well as C, O, S, and Sr isotopic anomalies were probably the first results of the main Pfalzian phase of the Hercynian tectogenesis with associated weakening of suprasubduction volcanism, intense regional metamorphism, and denudation of carbonaceous sedimentary sequences of orogens.

Polar amplification of the Northern Hemisphere's warming signal is more pronounced in the R15 model, in part due to the R15's cooler control climate, which allows for larger snow and ice albedo positive feedbacks. Both models project a substantial weakening of the North Atlantic overturning circulation and a large reduction in the volume of Arctic sea ice to occur in the 21st century.

In the early and mid-summer, the Yangtze River discharge increases, mainly due to the large increase in precipitation in the preceding months, which has been stored in the catchment."], "title": "Impacts of global warming on changes in the East Asian monsoon and the related river discharge in a global time-slice experiment"}]
