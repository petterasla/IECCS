It is found that during the last 20 years, the ISO has weakened in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean, but becomes more active in the central Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal; under the background of the global warming, increase in the amplitude of ISO intensity suggests that the ISO has become more active than before, with an obvious seasonal cycle, i.e., strong during winter and spring, but weak during summer and autumn; the energy of the upper tropospheric zonal winds has more concentrated in wave numbers 1-3, and the frequency of ISO tended to increase. Comparison between the results of control experiment and CO2 increase (1% per year) experiment of FGOALS-1.0g (developed at LASG) with the first and second 20-yr observations, is also performed, respectively. The comparative results show that the spatial structure of the ISO was well reproduced, but the strength of ISO was underestimated. On the basis of space-time spectral analysis, it is found that the simulated ISO contains too much high frequency waves, leading to the underestimation of ISO intensity due to the dispersion of ISO energy. However, FGOALS-1.0g captured the salient features of ISO under the global warming background by two contrast experiments, such as the vitality and frequency-increasing of ISO in the central Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.","Coupled general circulation model (CGCM); Global warming; Tropical intraseasonal oscillation (ISO)","atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate oscillation; general circulation model; global warming; numerical model; seasonal variation; spectral analysis; troposphere; weather forecasting; Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial)",,,,,,"Bitz, C.M., Holland, M.M., Eby, M., Simulating the ice-thickness distribution in a coupled climate model (2001) J.
