Through a literature study, it is found that VAs in the form of Negotiated Agreements (NAs) are more successful in promoting PL than other types of VAs that have less focus on the participatory aspect of the policy processes. The paper contributes to the existing VA policy literature through highlighting the predominately overseen learning values of implementing NA as well as providing policy recommendations on VA learning processes. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","climate policy; dialogue; global warming; NAs; negotiated agreements; participatory policy-making; PL; policy cycle; policy design; policy learning; policy management; VAs; voluntary agreements",,,,,,,"Aggeri, F., Environmental policies and innovation: a knowledge-based perspective on cooperative approaches (1999) Research Policy, 28, pp. 699-717; Bailey, I., Industry environmental agreements and climate policy: learning by comparison (2008) Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning, 10, pp. 153-173; Bennett, C., Howlett, M., The lessons of learning: reconciling theories of policy learning and policy change (1992) Policy Science, 25, pp. 275-295; Bjørner, T.B., Jenssen, H.H., Energy taxes, voluntary agreements and investment subsidies – a micro-panel analysis of the effect on Danish industrial companies’ energy demand (2002) Resource and Energy Economics, 24, pp. 229-249; Blyth, W., Bradley, R., Bunn, D., Clarke, C., Wilson, T., Yang, M., Investment risks under uncertain climate change policy (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 5766-5773; Börkey, P., Lévêque, F., Voluntary approaches for environmental protection in the European Union – a survey (2000) European Environment, 10, pp. 35-54; Dinica, V., Support systems for the diffusion of renewable energy technologies – an investor perspective (2006) Energy Policy, 34, pp. 461-480; Dinica, V., Bressers, H.T.A., de Bruijn, T., The implementation of a multi-annual agreement for energy efficiency in The Netherlands (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 1196-1212; Driessen, P.P.J., Glasbergen, P., Verdaas, C., Interactive policy-making – a model of management for public policy works (2001) European Journal of Operational Research, 128, pp. 322-337; Ekins, P., Etheridge, B., The environmental and economic impacts of the UK climate change agreements (2006) Energy Policy, 34, pp. 2071-2086; Etheredge, L.S., Short, J., Thinking about government learning (1983) Journal of Management Studies, 20, pp. 41-59; European Commission, (1996) Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on Environmental Agreements (COM(96) 561 Final), , http://eur-lex. europa.eu, accessed on 12 April, 2009; European Commission, (2002) Environmental Agreements at Community Level within the Framework of the Action Plan on the Simplification and Improvement of the Regulatory Environment (COM(2002) 412 Final), , http://eur-lex.europa.eu, accessed on 12 April 2009; European Parliament, (2003) Report on Environmental Agreements at Community Level within the Framework of the Action Plan ‘Simplifying and Improving the Regulatory Environment’ (COM(2002) 412 – 2002/2278(INI)), , http://www.europarl.europa.eu, Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy accessed on 12 April 2009; Geurts, J.L.A., Joldersma, C., Methodology for participatory policy analysis (2001) European Journal of Operational Research, 128, pp. 300-310; Glachant, M., The cost efficiency of voluntary agreements for regulating industrial pollution: a Coasen approach (1999) Voluntary Approaches in Environmental Policy, pp. 75-89. , Carraro, C. and Lévêque, F.
