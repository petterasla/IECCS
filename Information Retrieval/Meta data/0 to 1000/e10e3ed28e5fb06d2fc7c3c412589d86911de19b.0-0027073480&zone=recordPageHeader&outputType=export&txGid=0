Recently numerous authors have stated that the major stress results from ""abnormally high' seasonal sea surface temperatures (SST) and have implicated global warming as a cause, stating that recent episodes of coral bleaching result therefrom. However, an analysis of available SST data sets shows no discernible warming trend that could cause an increase in coral bleaching. Given the lack of long-term records synoptic with observations of coral ecosystem health, there is insufficient evidence available to label temperatures observed in coincidence with recent regional bleaching events as ""abnormally' high. -Authors",,"bleaching; coral; coral reef ecosystem; environmental stress; global warming; reef; sea surface temperature; SST; stress; Caribbean; Caribbean Sea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00074977,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027073480
