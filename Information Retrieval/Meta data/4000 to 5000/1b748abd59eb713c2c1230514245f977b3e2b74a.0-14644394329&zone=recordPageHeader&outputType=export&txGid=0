We monitored first flowering day (FFD) for 144 species in a subarctic-alpine area in Swedish Lapland over a period of 10 yr (1992-2001). Temperature and global radiation were monitored continuously, and snowcover duration was observed. Thawing degree-days and snowcover duration (exposure) were the dominant environmental controls on phenology. We introduce a lability index (LI) to describe the interannual variability in FFD among species. The temporal sequence of species is very constant among years, although a few species are more labile. The species were also classified into the catagories ""Functional type,"" ""Raunkiær's life form,"" and ""Sørensen's wintering floral type."" The last two reflected the environmental data best, and together with ""Exposure"" they were combined into a phenology index (PI). The index was subsequently used in a triangular ordination together with FFD. The ordination illustrates whether species flower earlier or later than expected from their preconditions. We hypothesize that species having a delayed flowering respond more readily to global warming than species having an already optimized flowering.","Global change; Lability index; Life forms; Long-term monitoring; Phenology index","alpine environment; climate change; flowering; phenology; subarctic region; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; World",,,,,,"Alatalo, J.M., Molau, U., Female frequencies and sex-associated morphological differences in gynodioecious Silene acaulis (Caryophyllaceae) (1995) Nordic Journal of Botany, 15, pp. 251-256; Alatalo, J.M., Totland, Ø., Response to simulated climatic change in an alpine and subarctic pollen-risk strategist, Silene acaulis (1997) Global Change Biology, 3 (1 SUPPL.), pp. 74-79; Arft, A.M., Response patterns of arctic plant species to experimental warming (1999) Ecological Monographs, 69, pp. 491-511; Billings, W.D., Bliss, L.C., An alpine snowbank environment and its effect on vegetation, plant development, and productivity (1959) Ecology, 40, pp. 388-397; Björk, R., (2000) Soil Properties and Plant Community Types at Latnjajaure, , B.Sc. thesis, Botanical Institute, Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden; Chapin III, F.S., Bret-Harte, M.S., Hobbie, S.E., Zhong, H., Plant functional types as predictors of transient responses of arctic vegetation to global change (1996) Journal of Vegetation Science, 7, pp. 347-358; Diekmann, M., Relationship between flowering phenology of perennial herbs and meteorological data in deciduous forests of Sweden (1996) Canadian Journal of Botany, 74, pp. 528-537; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Harris, I.T.B., Williamson, M.H., Relationship between first flowering date and temperature in the flora of a locality in central England (1995) Functional Ecology, 9, pp. 55-60; Graglia, E., Jonasson, S., Michelsen, A., Schmidt, I.K., Effects of shading, nutrient application and warming on leaf growth and shoot densities of dwarf shrubs in two arctic-alpine plant communities (1997) Ecoscience, 4, pp. 191-198; Henry, G.H.R., Molau, U., Tundra plants and climate change: The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) (1997) Global Change Biology, 3 (1 SUPPL.), pp. 1-9; Hultén, E., (1958) The Amphi-Atlantic Plants, , Almqvist & Wiksell, Stockholm, Sweden; Hultén, E., (1962) The Circumpolar Plants. 1.
