Changing human populations and industrialization affect almost every aspect of the environment. In particular, the prospects of climatic warming, urbanization and vegetation changes have the potential to materially affect global patterns of vector-borne diseases. Global warming will enable the expansion of the geographical distributions of vectors. The population dynamics of vectors will change in response to extended seasons suitable for development followed by less severe winters. The incidence of epidemics is likely to change in response to an expected disproportionate increase in the frequency of extreme climatic events. The impact of such changes on each of the major vector-borne diseases is reviewed and projections are made on the likely global areas at risk from spread of disease vectors. Research needs are identified and response strategies are suggested in the context of the ever-increasing impact of human populations and industrial activity on the environment.",,"animal; climate; environmental health; human; parasite vector; physiology; pollution; research; review; urbanization; Animal; Arthropod Vectors; Climate; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollution; Human; Research; Urbanization",,,,,,,"Sutherst, R.W.",,,,,,,,03005208,,,8222987,"English","Ciba Found Symp",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027350140
