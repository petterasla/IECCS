This process involves the identification and accurate selection of the ice sheet's surface location and interface between the ice sheet and the underlying bedrock for each measurement. Identifying the surface and bedrock locations in the radar imagery enables the computation of ice sheet thickness, which is important for the study of ice sheets, their volume, and how they may contribute to global climate change. The time-consuming manual approach requires sparse hand-selection of surface and bedrock interfaces by several human experts, and interpolating between the selections to save time. © 2010 IEEE.","Polar ice thickness; Radar data processing","Airborne radars; Antarctica; Global climate changes; Greenland; Human expert; Ice sheet; Polar ice; Radar data processing; Radar imagery; Surface location; Work Focus; Climate change; Data handling; Geology; Glaciers; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Thickness measurement; Tracking radar; Ice",,,,,,"Cozman, F., Krotkov, E., Guestrin, C., Outdoor visual position estimation for planetary rovers (2000) Autonomous Robots, 9 (2), pp. 135-150; (2010), http://www.cresis.ku.edu/, Center for Remote Sensin of Ice Sheets [Online].
