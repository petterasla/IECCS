In this study, we investi-gate the impacts of climate and vegetation composition on soil organic-matter (SOM) stocks and characteristics along an elevation gradient (900 to 1900 m asl) in the Austrian Limestone Alps. The soils classified as Leptic Histosols, i.e., organic soils directly overlying the calcareous bed-rock. Soil organic-carbon stocks (SOC; mean ± standard deviation) to bedrock increased in the low-elevation forest sites from 19 ± 3kg m-2 (900 m asl) to 31 ± 3kg m-2 (1300 m asl), reached a maximum (38 ± 5kg m-2) in the shrubland at 1500 m asl, but decreased again in the high-elevation grassland sites (26 ± 3kg m-2 at 1700 m asl and 13 ± 3kg m-2 at 1900 m asl). Thermo-gravimetic measurements and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) suggest that the upper soil layers were dominated by more labile organic compounds, whereas more persistent materials increased with depth. Along the studied climosequence, the aliphatic FTIR band (2920cm-1) was lower in the low-elevation forest sites compared to the high-elevation grassland sites. Most other FTIR bands did not change with altitude, but were related to specific site condi-tions, such as vegetation composition and associated differences in soil pH. Our results demon-strate that differences in SOM stocks and characteristics are not consistently related to varia-tions in climatic conditions along the studied elevation gradient, but are strongly affected by the vegetation composition, their C input and litter quality. This, in turn, is expected to shift in re-sponse to climate change. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.
