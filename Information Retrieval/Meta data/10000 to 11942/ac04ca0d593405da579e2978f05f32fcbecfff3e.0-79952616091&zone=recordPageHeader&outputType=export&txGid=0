The four information drives (ubiquity, uniqueness, unison, and universality) are extended to a physical setting and used to report the key characteristics of each system from both a physical and informational perspective. The article argues that the traditional customer orientation to determining systems requirements may fail to create the breakthrough systems designs that are required to reduce society's climate harming emissions. Rather, we need an innovation orientation based on understanding consumers' fundamental physical and informational needs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.
