Many genes have been shown to be essential for molecular improvement of rice cold-tolerance traits. However, less is known about the molecular cellular mechanism of their response to cold stress. Here, we investigated OsRAN2 involved in regulation of cell division during cold stress in rice. Expression of OsRAN2 was increased under cold treatment, but not during salt and drought stress. The mean root mitotic index was closely related to the expression level of OsRAN2. Knockdown transgenic rice lines showed an aberrant organization of spindles during mitosis and stunted growth during development. Overexpression of OsRAN2 enhanced cold tolerance in rice. The transgenic rice overexpressing OsRAN2 showed maintained cell division, decreased proportion of cells with intranuclear tubulin and formation of a normal nuclear envelope under the cold condition. Our study suggests a mechanism for OsRAN2 in regulating cold resistance in rice by maintaining cell division through promoting the normal export of intranuclear tubulin at the end of mitosis. This insight could help improve the cold-tolerance trait in rice. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Intact nuclear envelope; Small GTPase","inorganic salt; plant DNA; plant RNA; Ran protein; tubulin; vegetable protein; adaptive radiation; cell organelle; climate change; cold tolerance; crop production; drought stress; gene expression; low temperature; molecular analysis; protein; rice; transgenic plant; adaptation; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; cell division; cell nucleus membrane; cold; cytology; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunohistochemistry; meristem; metabolism; microtubule; mitosis; physiological stress; physiology; rice; transgenic plant; transmission electron microscopy; ultrastructure; upregulation; Adaptation, Physiological; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Cell Division; Cold Temperature; DNA, Plant; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Immunohistochemistry; Meristem; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Microtubules; Mitosis; Nuclear Envelope; Oryza sativa; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; ran GTP-Binding Protein; RNA, Plant; Salts; Stress, Physiological; Tubulin; Up-Regulation",,"DNA, Plant; Plant Proteins; RNA, Plant; Salts; Tubulin; ran GTP-Binding Protein, 3.6.5.2",,,,"Ach, R.A., Gruissem, W., A small nuclear GTP-binding protein from tomato suppresses a Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell-cycle mutant (1994) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 91, pp. 5863-5867; Andaya, V.C., Tai, T.H., Fine mapping of the qCTS12 locus, a major QTL for seedling cold tolerance in rice (2006) Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 113, pp. 467-475; Barnett, J.R., Microtubules in interphase nuclei of Aesculus hippocastanum L (1991) Annals of Botany, 68, pp. 159-165; Belhumeur, P., Lee, A., Tam, R., DiPaolo, T., Fortin, N., Clark, M.W., GSP1 and GSP2, genetic suppressors of the prp20-1 mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: GTP-binding proteins involved in the maintenance of nuclear organization (1993) Molecular and Cellular Biology, 13, pp. 2152-2216; Bischoff, F.R., Ponstingl, H., Catalysis of guanine nucleotide exchange on Ran by the mitotic regulator RCC1 (1991) Nature, 354, pp. 80-82; Bischoff, F.R., Ponstingl, H., Mitotic regulator protein RCC1 is complexed with a nuclear ras-related polypeptide (1991) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 88, pp. 10830-10834; Bischoff, F., Molendijk, A., Rajendrakumar, C.S., Palme, K., GTP-binding proteins in plants (1999) Cell Molecular of Life Science, 55, pp. 233-256; Cheng, C., Yun, K.Y., Ressom, H.W., Mohanty, B., Bajic, V.B., Jia, Y., Yun, S.J., De Los Reyes, B.G., An early response regulatory cluster induced by low temperature and hydrogen peroxide in seedlings of chilling-tolerant japonica rice (2007) BMC Genomics, 8, p. 175; Clarke, P.R., Zhang, C., Spatial and temporal coordination of mitosis by Ran GTPase (2008) Nature Reviews.
