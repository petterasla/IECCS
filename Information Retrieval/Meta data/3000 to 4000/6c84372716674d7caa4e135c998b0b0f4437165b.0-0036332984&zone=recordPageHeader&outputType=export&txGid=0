As a reference, hindcast simulations for the period 1980-93 have been performed using observed three-hourly meteorological forcing fields and observed monthly river runoff. The results are compared with available observations from monitoring stations. The observed Baltic Sea climate is well reproduced by the model. Furthermore, two sets of 9-year time slice experiments have been performed using results from an atmospheric regional climate model as forcing. One of the time slice sets represents pre-industrial greenhouse conditions (control simulation), and the other set represents a global warming condition with a 150% increase in equivalent CO2 concentrations (scenario simulation) with lateral boundary conditions from the global atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, HadCM2. To simulate river runoff, a large-scale hydrological model has been applied. As the time slices are too short to properly spin up initial stratification for future climate, salinity is treated as an uncertainty factor. An extreme condition is obtained by integrating the Baltic Sea model for a period of 100 years while assuming that no salt water inflow will occur in the future. Salinity in the Gotland Basin decreases in the surface layer by about 3 to 4 psu and in the bottom layer by about 6 to 6.5 psu. The final quasi-equilibrium is characterized by salinities of 2.8 psu (minimum at the surface) to 6.5 psu (maximum at the bottom). The area averaged annual mean sea surface temperature change between scenario and control run is about 2.3 °C. The warming in different seasons is almost the same. The computational effective time slice approach in dynamical downscaling experiments is regarded as a feasible technique to regionalize global climate change experiments in the Baltic Sea.",,"climate modeling; ice-ocean interaction; regional climate; salinity; sea surface temperature; Baltic Sea",,,,,,"Bergström, S., Carlsson, B., River runoff to the Baltic Sea: 1950-1990 (1994) Ambio, 23, pp. 280-287; Bodin, S., A predictive numerical model of the atmospheric boundary layer based on the turbulent energy equation (1979) Report Meteorology and Climatology, 13, p. 139. , Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, SE-60176 Norrköping, Sweden; Bryan, K., A numerical method for the study of the circulation of the World Ocean (1969) J Comput Phys, 4, pp. 347-376; Bryan, K., Cox, M.D., An approximate equation of state for numerical models of ocean circulation (1972) J Phys Oceanogr, 2, pp. 510-514; Bumke, K., Karger, U., Hasse, L., Niekamp, K., Evaporation over the Baltic Sea as an example of a semi-enclosed sea (1998) Contr Atmos Phys, 71, pp. 249-261; Cox, M.D., A primitive equation 3-dimensional model of the ocean (1984) GFDL Ocean Group Tech Rep 1, , GFDL, Princeton University, USA; Gibson, J.K., Kållberg, P., Uppala, S., Hernandez, A., Nomura, A., Serrano, E., ERA description (1997) ECMWF Re-analysis Project Rep Series I, p. 66. , European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, United Kingdom; Gill, A.E., (1982) Atmosphere-ocean Dynamics, p. 662. , Academic Press, London; Graham, P.L., Modeling runoff to the Baltic Sea (1999) Ambio, 27, pp. 328-334; Haapala, J., Leppäranta, M., Simulating the Baltic Sea ice season with a coupled ice-ocean model (1996) Tellus, 48 A, pp. 622-643; Haapala, J., Leppäranta, M., The Baltic Sea ice season in changing climate (1997) Boreal Environ Res, 2, pp. 93-108; Haapala, J., Juottonen, A., Marnela, M., Leppäranta, M., Tuomenvirta, H., Modelling the variability of the sea ice conditions in the Baltic Sea under different climate conditions (2002) Ann Glaciol, 33. , in press; Hibler, W.D., A dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model (1979) J Phys Oceanogr, 9, pp. 817-846; Hilmer, M., Jung, T., Evidence for a recent change in the link between the North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic sea ice export (2000) Geophys Res Lett, 27, pp. 989-992; Hulme, M., Conway, D., Jones, P.D., Jiang, T., Zhou, X., Barrow, E.M., Turney, C., (1995) A 1961-90 Gridded Surface Climatology for Europe, p. 51. , maps (available from Climatic Research Unit, Norwich UK); Hunke, E.C., Dukowicz, J.K., An elastic-viscous-plastic model for sea ice dynamics (1997) J Phys Oceanogr, 27, pp. 1849-1867; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, p. 944. , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Houghton JT et al.
