A detailed chronology of accumulation, based on 14C, an occurrence of the Askja AD 1875 tephra and 241Am measurements has been derived for the last 700 years. This shows significant changes in the mass balance of the peat profile, with minimum rates of net carbon sequestration overlapping with the period of minimum spring and summer temperature ; documented by published tree-ring evidence. The paper presents a methodology for calculating empirically past changes in the rate of net carbon sequestration in boreal peatlands and for exploring the effects of climatic variations (and possible future global warming) on these rates.","Chronology; Climate change; High latitudes; High-precision dating; Late Holocene; Mass balance; Peat; Radiocarbon; Sweden; Tephra","boreal peatlands; carbon sequestration; chronology; peat accumulation; radiocarbon dating; Sweden, Stor Amyran",,,,,,"Appleby, P.G., Nolan, P.J., Gifford, D.W., Godfrey, M.J., Oldfield, F., Anderson, N.J., Battarbee, R.W., 210Pb dating by low background gamma counting (1986) Hydrobiologia, 43, pp. 21-27; Appleby, P.G., Richardson, N., Nolan, P.J., 241Am dating of lake sediments (1991) Hydrobiologia, 214, pp. 35-42; Briffa, K.R., Jones, P.D., Bartholin, T.S., Eckstein, D., Schweingruber, F.H., Karlen, W., Zetterberg, P., Eronen, M., Fennoscandian summers from AD 500: Temperature changes on short and long timescales (1992) Climate Dynamics, 7, pp. 111-119; Clark, R.M., Renfrew, C., A statistical approach to the calibration of floating tree-ring chronologies using radiocarbon dates (1972) Archaeometry, 14, pp. 15-19; Clymo, R.S., A high-resolution sampler of surface peat (1988) Functional Ecology, 2, pp. 425-431; Shane, L.C.K., Cushing, E.J., Peat Growth (1991) Quaternary Landscapes, , London: Bellhaven; Clymo, R.S., Oldfield, K., Appleby, P.G., Pearson, G.W., Ratnesar, P., Richardson, N., The record of atmospheric deposition on a rain-dependent peatland (1990) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B, 327, pp. 105-112; De Vries, H., Variations in concentration of radiocarbon with time and location on Earth (1958) Koniglike Nederlands Akademie Van Wetenschappen, Amsterdam, Proceedings, Series B, 5, pp. 94-102; Dugmore, A.J., Icelandic volcanic ash in Scotland (1989) Scottish Geographical Magazine, 105, pp. 168-172; Dugmore, A.J., Larsen, G., Newton, A.J., Seven tephra isochrones in Scotland (1995) The Holocene, 5, pp. 257-266; Dugmore, A.J., Newton, A.J., Edwards, K.J., Larsen, G., Blackford, J.J., Cook, G.T., Long distance marker horizons from small-scale eruptions: British tephra deposits from the AD 1510 eruption of Hekla, Iceland (1997) Journal of Quaternary Research, , in press; Eurola, S., Hicks, S., Kaakinen, E., Key to Finnish mire types (1984) European Mires, pp. 11-117. , P.D.
