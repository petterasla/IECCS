This has been revealed by five separate overlap periods of concurrenly operating morning and afternoon satellites. For MSU channel two, comparisons to ten years of radiosonde data show that these anomalies are closely related to anomalies in 850-300 mbar thickness, with gridpoint correlations to radiosondes usually ranging between 0.85 and 0.95. The comparisons also suggest that there is no drift or bias in the MSU's (or US-controlled radiosonde system) between 1979-1988 to about 0.01°C when results are averaged over the Pacific or Caribbean. -from Authors",,"global brightness temperature; microwave sounding unit; radiosonde; temperature monitoring; tropospheric temperature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026266485
