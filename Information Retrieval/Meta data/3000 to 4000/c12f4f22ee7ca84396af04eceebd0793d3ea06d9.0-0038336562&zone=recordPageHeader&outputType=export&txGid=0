Overall, we estimate that China's croplands lost 1.6% of their SOC (to a depth of 0.3 m) in 1990, and that U.S. cropland lost 0.1%. A key element in this difference was that ∼25% of aboveground crop residue in China was returned to the soil, compared to ∼90% in the United States. In China, SOC losses were greatest in the northeast (∼103 kg C·ha-1·yr-1), and were generally smaller (&lt;0.5 × 103 kg C·ha-1·yr-1) in regions with a longer cultivation history. Some regions showed SOC gains, generally &lt;103 kg C·ha-1·yr-1. Reduced organic-matter input to China's cropland soils, and lower overall SOC levels in those soils, led to lower levels of N mineralization in the simulations, consistent with higher rates of synthetic-fertilizer application in China. C and N cycles are closely linked to soil fertility, crop yield, and non-point-source environmental pollution.","Agroecosystem; Biogeochemistry; Carbon sequestration; China, farming management; Chinese agriculture, sustainability; Crop residue; Global warming and carbon sequestration; Modeling C and N biogeochemical cycles in cropland; Organic C in cropland soil","agricultural land; biogeochemical cycle; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; organic carbon; China",,,,,,"Baiming, C., The existing state, future change trends in land-use and food (1999) Ambio, 28, pp. 67-71; Brown, L., Jarvis, S., Sneath, R., Phillips, V., Goulding, K., Li, C., Development and application of a mechanistic model to estimate emission of nitrous oxide from UK agriculture (2002) Atmospheric Environment, 36, pp. 917-928; Buck, J.L., (1937) Land Utilization in China, , University of Nanking Press, Nanking, China; Buyanovsky, G.A., Wagner, G.H., Carbon cycling in cultivated land and its global significance (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 131-141; Cai, Z.C., Effect of land use on organic carbon storage in soils in eastern China (1996) Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 91, pp. 383-393; Davidson, E.A., Ackerman, I.L., Changes in soil carbon inventories following cultivation of previously untilled soils (1993) Biogeochemistry, 20, pp. 161-193; Duan, Z.H., Liu, X.M., Qu, J.J., The effects on atmospheric CO2 content of land desertification in China (1996) Journal of Arid Land Resources and Environment, 10, pp. 89-93. , In Chinese; (2001), www.apps.fao.org, OnlineFeng, J., Yang, H., Zhao, Q.G., Review of the study on the storage of SOC and its effective factors (2000) Soil, 2000, pp. 11-17. , In Chinese; Follett, R.F., Soil management concepts and carbon sequestration in cropland soils (2001) Soil and Tillage Research, 61, pp. 77-92; Frolking, S., Mosier, A.R., Ojima, D.S., Li, C., Parton, W.J., Potter, C.S., Priesack, E., Smith, K.A., Comparison of N2O emissions from soils at three temperate agricultural sites: Simulations of year-round measurements by four models (1998) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 55, pp. 77-105; Fu, Z., The dilemma of fertilizer in China (2001) People's Daily, p. 2. , In Chinese, 11 August 2001: Domestic News; Guan, S.Y., Zhang, W.H., A study on the relationship between meteorological factors and nutrient contents in steppe soils in China (1999) Grassland China, 3, pp. 68-70. , In Chinese; (1994) Soils in Inner Mongolia, , Science Press, Beijing, China; Kellogg, R.L., Lander, C.H., Moffitt, D.C., Gollehon, N., Manure nutrients relative to the capacity of cropland and pastureland to assimilate nutrients: Spatial and temporal trends for the United States (2000) USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, Economic Research Service, Publication, NPS00-0579; Lal, R., Kimble, J.M., Follett, R.F., Cole, C.V., (1998) The Potential of U.S. Cropland to Sequester Carbon and Mitigate the Greenhouse Effect, , Ann Arbor Press, Chelsea, Michigan, USA; Li, C., Modeling trace gas emissions from agricultural ecosystems (2000) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 58, pp. 259-276; Li, C., Frolking, S., Crocker, G.J., Grace, P.R., Klír, J., Körchens, M., Poulton, P.R., Modeling long-term soil organic carbon in agricultural soils with the DNDC model (1997) Geoderma, 81, pp. 45-60; Li, C., Frolking, S., Frolking, T.A., A model of nitrous oxide evolution from soil driven by rainfall events.
