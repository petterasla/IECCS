(2009, this journal) is critiqued. It is shown that their exponential model for characterizing CO2 trajectories for historical data is not estimated properly. An exponential model is properly estimated and is shown to fit over the entire 51 year period of available data. Further, the entire problem of estimating models for the CO2 historical data is shown to be ill-posed because alternate model forms fit the data equally well. To illustrate this point the past 51 years of CO2 data were analyzed using three different time-dependent models that capture the historical pattern of CO2 increase. All three fit with R2&gt;0.98, are visually indistinguishable when overlaid, and match each other during the calibration period with R2&gt;0.999. Projecting the models forward to 2100, the exponential model comes quite close to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) best estimate of 836ppmv. The other two models project values far below the IPCC low estimates. The problem of characterizing historical CO2 levels is thus indeterminate, because multiple models fit the data equally well but forecast very different future trajectories. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Business as usual scenario; Climate; Greenhouse gases; IPCC","Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Best estimates; Business as usual scenario; Business-as-usual; Exponential models; Historical data; Ill posed; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Multiple models; Time-dependent models; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Weather forecasting; Climate models; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; climate change; estimation method; forecasting method; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; modeling; air pollution; article; calibration; climate change; data analysis; historical research; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; prediction and forecasting; priority journal",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Govindan, R.B., Vyushin, D., Bunde, A., Brenner, S., Havlin, S., Schellnhuber, H.-J., Global climate models violate scaling of the observed atmospheric variability (2002) Physical Review Letters, 89; Hofmann, D.J., Butler, J.H., Tans, P.P., A new look at atmospheric carbon dioxide (2009) Atmospheric Environment, 43, pp. 2084-2086; Climate change 2007: the physical science basis (2007) Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. 996. , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK/New York, USA, S.
