Unchecked rural and urban development also has contributed to changes in water quality, including enhanced microbial populations and increased water-borne pathogen occurrence. In this study we look at changing environment within the Oldman River Basin and its impact on water quality and quantity. The cumulative effects include a decline in net water supplies, and declining quality resulting in increased risk of disease. Our data indicates that decreases in the rate of flow of water can result in sedimentation of bacterial contaminants within the water column. Water for ecosystems, urban consumption, recreation and distribution through irrigation is often drawn from water-holding facilities such as dams and weirs, and concern must be expressed over the potential for contaminate build-up and disproportionate potential of these structures to pose a risk to human and animal health. With disruption of natural flow rates for water resulting from environmental change such as global warming and/or human intervention, increased attention needs to be paid to use of best management practices to protect source water supplies. © IWA Publishing 2006.","Global warming; Irrigation; Snowpack accumulation; Streamflow; Water availability; Water-borne pathogens","Catchments; Dams; Flow of water; Sedimentation; Stream flow; Water quality; Weirs; Snowpack accumulation; Water availability; Water-borne pathogens; Rivers; Catchments; Dams; Flow of water; Rivers; Sedimentation; Stream flow; Water quality; Weirs; global warming; river basin; snow accumulation; streamflow; water availability; water pollution; water quality; animal health; article; bacterium contamination; Canada; controlled study; ecosystem; environmental change; environmental protection; flow rate; futurology; greenhouse effect; health hazard; irrigation (agriculture); nonhuman; recreation; river basin; sedimentation; urban area; water contamination; water flow; water management; water quality; water supply; Alberta; Colony Count, Microbial; Conservation of Natural Resources; Enterobacteriaceae; Greenhouse Effect; Rivers; Snow; Urbanization; Water Microbiology; Water Movements; Water Pollutants; Water Supply; Alberta; Canada; North America; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,"Water Pollutants",,,,"(2002) South Saskatchewan River Basin Water Management Planning, , Alberta Environment, Alberta Sustainable Resource Development and Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Phase 2: Basin Advisory Committees and Government Staff Directory.
