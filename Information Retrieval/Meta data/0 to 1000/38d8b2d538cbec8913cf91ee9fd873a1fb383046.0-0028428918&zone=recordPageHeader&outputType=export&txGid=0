By including all major greenhouse gases and their anthropogenic sources and sinks using best available science, the Report provides a practical illustration of the ""comprehensive approach"" policy to implementing the Convention's requirements. In addition to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion, the Report includes information on other sources and sinks for carbon dioxide, and for methane and nitrous oxide. Other gases considered include polyflourocarbons, hydroflourocarbons, and the primary tropospheric ozone precursors, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Current Global Warming Potential indices are used to compare and integrate the best estimates of climate change impacts of the major greenhouse gases. The presentation of emission data is intended to be transparent and comparable. The relative quality of the data for various gases and sources is indicated. The existence of environmental, economic, and other benefits to limiting emissions of all greenhouse gases, in addition to carbon dioxide, should be recognized. Continuing assessments and actions on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions, both nationally and internationally, are suggested. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"Anthropogenic sources; Climate change; Greenhouse gas; Nitrous oxide; Volatile organic compounds; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Fluorocarbons; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; fossil fuel; methane; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; canada; climate; combustion; conference paper; gas; greenhouse effect; information; policy",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; fluorocarbon, 11072-16-5; methane, 74-82-8; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Canada, Government of, ‘Canada's National Report on Climate Change: Actions to Meet Commitments Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’, Public Review Draft, September, 1993, Final Publication Cat.
