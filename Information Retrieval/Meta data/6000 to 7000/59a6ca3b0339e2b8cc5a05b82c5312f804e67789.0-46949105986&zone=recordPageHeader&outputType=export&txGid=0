Trends in the first appearance of adult dragonflies across Japan were analysed using a dataset consisting of observations from 1953 to 2005. Dynamic factor analysis was used to evaluate underlying common trends in a set of 48 time series. The appearance of the first adult dragonfly has significantly shifted to later in the spring in the past five decades. Generalized linear mixing models suggested that this is probably the result of increased air temperatures. Increased summer and autumn temperatures may provide longer bivoltine periods and a faster growth rate; thus, the second generation, which previously hatched in summer, can emerge in the autumn causing the size of the population of dragonflies that emerge in spring to decrease. It is also possible that reduced dragonfly populations along with human development are responsible for a delay in the first observed dragonflies in the spring. However, human population density did not appear to strongly affect the appearance date. This study provides the first evidence of a delay in insect phenological events over recent decades. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Global warming; Life cycle; Odonata; Oviposition; Temperature","air temperature; climate change; dragonfly; emergence; factor analysis; global warming; growth rate; life cycle; oviposition; phenology; air temperature; article; autumn; chronosequence; climate change; dragon fly; egg laying; greenhouse effect; growth rate; insect; Japan; larva; life cycle; nonhuman; population density; priority journal; spring; summer; Animals; Greenhouse Effect; Insects; Japan; Linear Models; Models, Biological; Population Density; Seasons; Temperature; Anisoptera (dragonflies); Hexapoda; Odonata",,,,,,"Ban, Y., Kiritani, K., Seasonal prevalence of aquatic insects in habiting paddy fields (1980) Jpn J.
