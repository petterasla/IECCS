In particular, a number of nearshore wave climate scenarios corresponding to a 'present' (1961-1990) and a future time-slice (2071-2100) are used to drive a beach evolution model to determine monthly and seasonal statistics. To limit the number of variables, an idealised shoreline segment is adopted. The nearshore wave climate scenarios are generated from wind climate scenarios through point wave hindcast and inshore transformation. The original wind forcing comes from regional climate change model experiments of different resolutions and/or driving global climate models, representing different greenhouse-gas emission scenarios. It corresponds to a location offshore the south central coast of England. Hypothesis tests are applied to map the degree of evidence of future change in wave and shoreline statistics relative to the present. Differential statistics resulting from different global climate models and future emission scenarios are also investigated. Further, simple, fast, and straightforward methods that are capable of accommodating a great number of climate change scenarios with limited data reduction requirements are proposed to tackle the problem under consideration. The results of this study show that there are statistically significant changes in nearshore wave climate conditions and beach alignment between current and future climate scenarios. Changes are most notable during late summer for the medium-high future emission scenario and late winter for the medium-low. Despite frequent disagreement between global climate change models on the statistical significance of a change, all experiments agreed in future seasonal trends. Finally, a point of importance for coastal management, material shoreline changes are generally linked to significant changes in future wave direction rather than wave height. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Beach evolution models; Climate change scenarios; Coastal management; Emission scenario; England; Future climate; Global climate changes; Global climate model; Greenhouse-gas emissions; Hypothesis tests; Model experiments; Near-shore waves; Regional climate changes; Seasonal trends; Shoreline change; Statistical significance; Straight-forward method; Wave climates; Wave direction; Wave heights; Wave hindcast; Wind climate; Wind forcing; Beaches; Climate models; Coastal engineering; Data reduction; Experiments; Gas emissions; Climate change; atmospheric wave; beach morphology; climate change; climate modeling; coastal evolution; coastal zone management; experimental study; global climate; greenhouse gas; hindcasting; nearshore environment; regional climate; statistical analysis; timescale; wave climate; wave direction; wave height; wave modeling; weather forecasting; wind forcing; wind wave; England; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Abernethy, C.L., Gilbert, G., (1975) Refraction of Wave Spectra, , Hydraulics Research Station, Wallingford Report INT117, May 1975; Alexander, L.V., Tett, S.F.B., Jónsson, T., Recent observed changes in severe storms over the United Kingdom and Iceland (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, pp. L13704. , doi:10.1029/2005GL022371; Bidlot, J.R., Holt, M.W., Numerical wave modelling at operational weather centres (1999) Coast Eng, 37 (3-4), pp. 409-429; Bidlot, J.R., Holt, M.W., (2006) Verification of Operational Global and Regional Wave Forecasting Systems Against Measurements From Moored Buoys, , JCOMM Technical Report, 30.
