However there are few, if any, models directly connecting phenology with population growth rates. In this paper we discuss connecting a distributional model describing mountain pine beetle phenology with a model of population success measured using annual growth rates derived from aerially detected counts of infested trees. This model bridges the gap between phenology predictions and population viability/growth rates for mountain pine beetle. The model is parameterized and compared with 8 years of data from a recent outbreak in central Idaho, and is driven using measured tree phloem temperatures from north and south bole aspects and cumulative forest area impacted. A model driven by observed south-side phloem temperatures and that includes a correction for forest area previously infested and killed is most predictive and generates realistic parameter values of mountain pine beetle fecundity and population growth. Given that observed phloem temperatures are not always available, we explore a variety of methods for using daily maximum and minimum ambient temperatures in model predictions. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Dendroctonus ponderosae; Growth rate prediction; Insect outbreak; Mountain pine beetle; Phenology; Temperature change","beetle; ecological modeling; environmental cue; fecundity; global warming; growth rate; pest outbreak; phloem; population growth; temperature effect; Coleoptera; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Hexapoda; Pinus mugo",,,,,,"Akaike, H., On the likelihood of a time series model (1978) Statistician, 27, pp. 217-235. , 10.2307/2988185; Alfaro, R., Campbell, R., Vera, P., Hawkes, B., Shore, T., Dendroecological reconstruction of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the Chilcotin Plateau of British Columbia.
