Results indicate that overall global warming will have a more widespread and greater impact on climate change. However soil degradation could also play a significant role in water resource issues in the future. Based on the model results, wet and dry climate regions are particularly susceptible to impacts from soil degradation. In general, reduced water holding capacities will result in increased water runoff during wet periods, which will result in higher overland flow rates and reduced recharge rates to groundwater. Water lost to runoff will also increase deficits during dry periods, in effect increasing the duration and intensity of dry periods.","Africa; Climate change; Soil degradation","climate change; environmental impact; global warming; soil degradation; water resource; Africa",,,,,,"Bryant, N.A., Johnson, L.F., Brazel, A.J., Balling, R.C., Hutchinson, C.F., Beck, L.R., Measuring the effect of overgrazing in the Sonoran desert (1990) Clim Change, 17, pp. 243-264; Dunne, K., Willmott, C.J., Global distribution of plantextractable water capacity of soil (1996) Int J Climatol, 16, pp. 841-859; Feddema, J.J., Estimated impacts of soil degradation on the African water balance and climate (1998) Clim Res, 10, pp. 127-141; Feddema, J.J., Future African water resources: Interactions between soil degradation and global warming (1999) Clim Change, 42 (3), pp. 561-596; Legates, D.R., Willmott, C.J., Mean seasonal and spatial variability in gauge-corrected global precipitation (1990) Int J Climatol, 10, pp. 111-127; Legates, D.R., Willmott, C.J., Mean seasonal and spatial variability in global surface air temperature (1990) Theor Appl Climatol, 41, pp. 11-21; Mather, J.R., (1978) The Climatic Water Budget in Environmental Analysis, , Lexington Books, Lexington; Middleton, N.J., Thomas, D.S.G., (1997) World Atlas of Desertification, 2nd Edn., , UNEP, Geneva; Mitchell, J.F.B., Johns, T.C., On modification of global warming and sulphate aerosols (1997) J Clim, 10 (2), pp. 245-267; Mitchell, J.F.B., Johns, T.C., Gregory, J.M., Tett, S., Climate response to increasing levels of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols (1995) Nature, 375, pp. 501-504; Oldeman, L.R., Guidelines for general assessment of the status of human-induced soil degradation (1988) Working Paper and Preprint 88/4, , ISRIC, Wageningen; Oldeman, L.R., Hakkeling, R.T.A., Sombroek, W.G., (1990) World Map of the Status of Human-induced Soil Degradation.
