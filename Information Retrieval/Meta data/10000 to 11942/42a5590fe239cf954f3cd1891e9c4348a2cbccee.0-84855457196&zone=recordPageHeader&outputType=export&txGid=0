The complexity of the phenomena in heavy water detritiation plants, determine the use of advanced equipment for technological processes involved. Pilot Plant for Tritium and Deuterium Separation developed the cryogenic technology of tritium separation from tritiated heavy water. The process is based on an catalyzed isotopic exchange module, where the tritium is extracted from tritiated heavy water. An important process in this way is to extract moisture from the wet hydrogen gas coming from the exchange column. This process takes place on two phases: extracting moisture from the gas resulting from isotopic exchange column on the primary system consists of a fully automated chiller; cleaning systems on molecular sieve adsorbents. The refrigeration system (chiller system) used Freon as refrigerant. Refrigerants are working fluid in any refrigeration system. They absorb heat from one source and send it to another source, usually through evaporation and condensation processes due to phase change. Chlorofluorocarbons - CFCs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFCs were developed as a series of non-toxic refrigerants, stable (at normal temperatures) that belong to a larger family of substances known as halogens. These refrigerants contained, amongst other elements, like chlorine. Refrigerants known as CFC12 (R12) and HCFC22 (R22) are stable, remaining in the atmosphere for many years, and eventually diffuse into the stratosphere. In the upper atmosphere the molecules of refrigerants with chlorine can destroys the ozone layer. In the lower atmosphere the molecules absorbs infrared radiation and contribute to global warming. Paper try to meet the safety of the operation requirements of nuclear facilities, technological performance of work required by the thermodynamic conditions but also environmental protection as an important factor in sustainable development of society.","Environment protection; Heat transfer; R407 refrigerant; Refrigeration efficiency",,,,,,,"(2008) ASHRAE Handbook, HVAC Systems and Equipment, American Society of Heating, , ASHRAE, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Atlanta, GA; Aprea, C., Greco, A., Vanoli, G.P., Condensation heat transfer coefficients for R22 and R407C in gravity driven flow regime within a smooth horizontal tube (2003) International Journal of Refrigeration, 26, pp. 393-401; Aprea, C., Mastrullo, R., An experimental evaluation of the vapour compression plant performances in presence of R407C leaks using an electronic expansion valve (2002) Applied Thermal Engineering, 22, pp. 161-171; Bejan, A., (1995) Entropy Generation Minimization, , CRC Press, Boca Raton; Bejan, A., Tsatsaronis, G., Moran, M., (1996) Thermal Design & Optimization, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Choi, J., Kim, Y., Influence of the expansion device on the performance of a heat pump using R407C under a range of charging conditions (2004) International Journal of Refrigeration, 27, pp. 378-384; Fatouh, M., Talaat, I.A., Mostafa, A., Performance assessment of a direct expansion air conditioner working with R407C as an R22 alternative (2010) Applied Thermal Engineering, 30, pp. 127-133; Roberts, N.A., http://www.eurocooling.com/articlerhodia.htm, Use of R417A (ISCEON® 59) in Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Applications, On line atRadcenco, V., (1994) Generalized Thermodynamics, , Technical Press, Bucharest, Romania; Rolston, J.H., Gale, K.L., Deuterium-protium isotopic fractionation between liquid water and gaseous hydrogen (1982) Journal of Physical Chemistry, 86, pp. 2494-2498; Radcenco, V., (1987) Refrigeration and Cryogenic Plants, , Technical Press, Bucharest, Romania; Radcenco, V., (1977) Criteria For Optimizing the Thermal Processes, , Technical Press, Bucharest, Romania; Sayyaadi, H., Nejatolahi, M., Multi-objective optimization of a cooling tower assisted vapor compression refrigeration system (2011) International Journal of Refrigeration, 34, pp. 243-256; Skovrup, M.J., Knudsen, H.J.H., Coolpack Software, the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), , http://www.et.web.mek.dtu.dk/Index.html, Department of Mechanical Egnineering (MEK), Section of Energy Engineering; http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com, Tools and Basic Information for Engineering and Design of Technical Applications 2011","Gherghinescu, S.; National Institute of R and D for Cryogenics and Isotopic, Technologies - ICIT Ramnicu, Valcea, 4 Uzinei Street, CP7 Raureni, Valcea, 240050, Romania; email: sorin70g@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,15829596,,,,"English","Environ.
