We tested the hypothesis that global warming is in motion in California and is causing accumulated winter chill to decrease across the fruit and nut growing regions of California. The detection of potential trends in accumulated winter chill (between 0 and 7.2°C) was determined using two complementary climate datasets. The California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) contains hourly climate data and is suitable for computing accumulated chill hours and chill degree-hours. But, its longest data records extend back only to the 1980s. The National Weather Service Coop climate record is longer, extending beyond the 1950s at many sites. But its datasets only contain information on daily maximum and minimum temperatures. To assess long term trends in winter chill accumulation, we developed an algorithm that converted information from daily maximum and minimum temperature into accumulated hours of winter chill and summations of chill-degree hours. These inferred calculations of chill hour accumulation were tested with and validated by direct measurements from hourly-based data from the CIMIS network. With the combined climate datasets, we found that the annual accumulation of winter chill hours and chill degree hours is diminishing across the fruit and nut growing regions of California. Observed trends in winter chill range between -50 and -260 chill hours per decade. We also applied our analytical algorithm to project changes in winter chill using regional climate projections of temperature for three regions in the Central Valley. Predicted rates of reduced winter chill, for the period between 1950 and 2100, are on the order of -40 h per decade. By the end of the 21st century, orchards in California are expected to experience less than 500 chill hours per winter. This chronic and steady reduction in winter chill is expected to have deleterious economic and culinary impact on fruit and nut production in California by the end of the 21st Century. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2007.",,"Analytical algorithms; California irrigation management information systems; Climate datasets; Direct measurement; Growing regions; Maximum and minimum temperatures; National Weather Services; Regional climate projections; Algorithms; Global warming; Fruits",,,,,"California Energy Commission","California Agriculture Overview (2003) California Agricultural Statistics Service, p. 10. , Anonymous, Sacramento; Aron, R., Availability of chilling temperatures in California (1983) Agric Meteorol, 28, pp. 351-363; Aron, R.H., A method for estimating the number of hours below a selected temperature threshold (1975) J Appl Meteorol, 14, pp. 1415-1418; Cayan, D., Kammerdiener, S., Dettinger, M., Caprio, J., Peterson, D., Changes in the onset of spring in the western United States (2001) B Am Meteorol Soc, 82, pp. 399-415; Cayan, D.R., Maurer, E.P., Dettinger, M., Tyree, M., Hayhoe, K., Bonfils, C., Duffy, P., Santer, B.D., Climate scenarios for California (2005) California Climate Change Center, p. 47. , CEC-500-2005-203-SD, Sacramento; Chmielewski, F.-M., Muller, A., Bruns, E., Climate changes and trends in phenology of fruit trees and field crops in Germany (2004) Agric Forest Meteorol, 121, pp. 69-78. , 1961-2000; Christy, J.R., Norris, W.B., Redmond, K., Gallo, K.P., Methodology and results of calculating central California surface temperature trends: Evidence of human-induced climate change?
