Unrestricted trade produces hot air when signatory countries, whose Kyoto targets are well above their business as usual emissions, trade in larger amounts of 'abundant' emission rights. Concerns on hot air motivated proposals for caps on emissions trading by the EU.

International permit trade provides enough efficiency gains to make all signatory countries better off than they would be without permit trade while mitigating hot air.
