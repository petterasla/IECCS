When discussing climate related threats with decision makers, cost-benefit analyses that support decisions are often demanded. The Dynamical Interactive Vulnerability Tool (DIVA) allows calculating the benefits of a normative coastal protection target versus a business as usual (BAU) scenario for the European Union (EU) coastal states. Results show that for most EU coastal countries long-term economic benefits are expected for a well-defined adaptation strategy during the second half of the 21st century. By 2100, about 200 bio $US are expected to be avoided if all EU coastal countries target the 100 year coastal protection goal. The situation is not equal for all countries, for some like Netherlands and Irish Republic large benefits up to 5.5% of the 2007 GDP are expected, while for countries like Estonia and Cyprus the adaptation level chosen proved to be too costly when compared with the impact costs of a BAU scenario.","Avoided impacts; Cumulative costs; Decision making; Vulnerability",,,,,,,"Allaert, G., (1996) The Belgian Coast: Signs of Recent Revival?, , Faculty of Applied Science, Ghent University; Church, J.A., Gregory, J.M., Huybrechts, P., Kuhun, M., Lambeck, K., Nhuan, M.T., Qin, D., Woodworth, P.L., Changes in sea level (2001) Climate Change 2001, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Eisenack, K., Tekken, V., Kropp, J.P., Stakeholders perception on climate change in the baltics (2007) Coastline Reports, pp. 245-255; Ericson, J.P., Vörösmarty, C.J., Dingman, S.L., Ward, L.G., Effective sea-level rise and deltas: Causes of change and human dimension implications (2006) Global and Planetary Change, 50, pp. 63-82; Hinkel, J., Klein, R.J.T., DINAS-COASTS: Developing a method and a tool for dynamic and interactive vulnerability assessment (2003) LOICZ Newsletter, (27), pp. 1-4; Hinkel, J., Klein, R.J.T., DINAS-COAST: Developing a method and a tool for dynamic and interactive vulnerability assessment (2004) DIVA Tool Documentation; Jeffrey, A.M., Episodic flooding and the cost of sea-level rise (2007) Ecological Economics, 63, pp. 149-159; Kropp, J.P., Block, A., Reusswig, F., Zickfeld, K., Schellnhuber, H.J., Semiquantitative assessment of regional climate vulnerability: The north-rhine westphalia study (2006) Climate Change, 76, pp. 265-290; Kropp, J.P., Scheffran, J., (2007) Advanced Methods for Risk Management and Decision Making in Sustainability Science, , New York, Nova Science Publishers; Mcfadden, L., Nicholls, R.J., Vafeidis, A.T., Tol, R.S.J., A methodology for modeling coastal space for global assessment (2007) Journal of Coastal Research, 23, pp. 911-920; Mcgranahan, G., Balk, D., Anderson, B., The rising tide: Assessing the risks of climate change and human settlements in low elevation coastal zones (2007) Environment and Urbanization, 19, pp. 17-37; Ng, W.-S., Mendelsohn, R., The impact of sea level rise on Singapore (2005) Environment and Development Economics, 10, pp. 201-215; Nicholls, R.J., Rising sea levels: Potential impacts and responses (2002) Global Environmental Change, pp. 83-107. , R.
