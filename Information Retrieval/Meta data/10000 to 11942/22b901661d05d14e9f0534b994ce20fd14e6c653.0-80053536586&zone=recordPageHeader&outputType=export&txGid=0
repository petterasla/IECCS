However, most studies of tree species have been conducted on a small scale and have focused on tree line ecotones by examining tree rings and age structure on account of the long life spans of the trees. To examine the impact of climate change on forest dynamics at a regional scale, we investigated differences in the population density and canopy height of a Japanese subalpine coniferous species, Abies mariesii, between 1967 and 2003 by analysis of high-resolution aerial photographs of the Hakkoda Mountains, Honshu, Japan. In 712 plots within the photographs we analyzed which environmental variables (including elevation, aspect, wetness, and distance from moorlands) account for these changes. The population density of A. mariesii decreased below 1000 m a.s.l. and increased above 1300 m a.s.l. It also increased around moorlands, which may provide refugia at low elevations. The rate of increase in canopy height was lowest on the southeastern slopes and on the periphery of the moorlands. The distinct changes in the population density of A. mariesii at its distribution limits probably reflect the responses of the population to climatic changes during three decades. Areas surrounding the moorlands may offer refugia in spite of the poor growing conditions there. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aerial photographs; Climate change; Generalized additive mixed-effect models; Global warming; Japan; Population dynamics; Refugia; Upward shifts","aerial photograph; age structure; climate change; climate effect; coniferous tree; ecotone; environmental effect; forest dynamics; global warming; image resolution; population density; population dynamics; refugium; tree ring; vertical distribution; Aomori; Honshu; Japan; Mount Hakkoda; Ou Mountains; Tohoku; Abies; Abies mariesii; Coniferophyta",,,,,,"Améztegui, A., Brotons, L., Coll, L., Land-use changes as major drivers of mountain pine (Pinus uncinata Ram.) expansion in the Pyrenees (2010) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19, pp. 632-641; Batllori, E., Gutiérrez, E., Regional tree line dynamics in response to global change in the Pyrenees (2008) Journal of Ecology, 96, pp. 1275-1288; Beale, C.M., Lennon, J.J., Yearsley, J.M., Brewer, M.J., Elston, D.A., Regression analysis of spatial data (2010) Ecology Letters, 13, pp. 246-264; Beckage, B., Osborne, B., Gavin, D.G., Pucko, C., Siccama, T., Perkins, T., A rapid upward shift of a forest ecotone during 40 years of warming in the Green Mountains of Vermont (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 105, pp. 4197-4202; Bradley, R.S., Jones, P.D., 'Little Ice Age' summer temperature variations: their nature and relevance to recent global warming trends (1993) The Holocene, 3, pp. 367-376; Brubaker, L.B., Responses of tree populations to climatic change (1986) Plant Ecology, 67, pp. 119-130; Camarero, J.J., Gutiérrez, E., Pace and pattern of recent treeline dynamics: response of ecotones to climatic variability in the Spanish Pyrenees (2004) Climatic Change, 63, pp. 181-200; Chatterjee, S., Hadi, A.S., Price, B., (2000) Regression Analysis by Example, , John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY, USA; Chen, I.C., Shiu, H.J., Benedick, S., Elevation increases in moth assemblages over 42 years on a tropical mountain (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 106, pp. 1479-1483; Daimaru, H., Taoda, H., Effect of snow pressure on the distribution of subalpine Abies mariesii Forests in northern Honshu Island, Japan (2004) Journal of Agricultural Meteorology, 60, pp. 253-261; Feeley, K.J., Silman, M.R., Bush, M.B., Upslope migration of Andean trees (2011) Journal of Biogeography, 38, pp. 783-791; Gehrig-Fasel, J., Guisan, A., Zimmermann, N.E., Tree line shifts in the Swiss Alps: climate change or land abandonment?
