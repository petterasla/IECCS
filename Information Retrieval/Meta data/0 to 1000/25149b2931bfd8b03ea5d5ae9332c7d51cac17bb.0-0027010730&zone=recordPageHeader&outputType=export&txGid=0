Temperature may have lethal or sub-lethal effects as well as pacing metabolism, other physiological responses and behaviour. It influences body size, growth, differentiation of muscle and meristic characters. Increase of temperature, as would occur with global warming, will change the timing of ecological events such as the spring plankton outburst so influencing the match or mismatch of larvae with their food supply and their predators. © 1991 BRILL.","Larval fish; Temperature",,,,,,,,"Blaxter, J.H.S.; Scottish Marine Biological Association, Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory, P.O.
