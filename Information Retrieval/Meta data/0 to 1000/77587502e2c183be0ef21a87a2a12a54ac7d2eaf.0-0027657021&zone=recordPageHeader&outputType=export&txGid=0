Among many greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide produced as a result of fossil fuel burning is a major contributor due to the huge volume emitted into the atmosphere. Because fossil fuels remain the driving force of modern economies, any economic growth in the developed or developing countries results in an increased emission of carbon dioxide. Consequently, reduction of carbon dioxide emissions has become an important issue. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that a worldwide reduction of the emission of green house gases by more that 60% is necessary to avert the global climate change. It is now well recognized that the disposal issue is the most important obstacle to overcome for a practical solution of the carbon dioxide problem. In this paper a simulation study on the storage and utilization of carbon dioxide in petroleum reservoirs has been carried out. For simple storage, simulation studies to determine the capacity of a given reservoir are conducted for different reservoirs with a wide range of governing parameters. Major parameters studied are: initial reservoir pressure, final average reservoir pressure, impurities in the injected gas, petrophysical properties of the reservoir, and initial fluid saturations. For the utilization, simulation studies are carried out for both miscible and immiscible flooding enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. It is difficult to maintain carbon dioxide miscibility in a reservoir. It is found that immiscible but stable injection of carbon dioxide may be very effective in recovering oil. © 1993.","CO2 storage; disposal; enhanced oil recovery; petroleum reservoirs","Air pollution control; Climatology; Enhanced recovery; Flue gases; Greenhouse effect; Injection (oil wells); Mathematical models; Petroleum reservoirs; Storage (materials); Carbon dioxide disposal; Carbon dioxide storage; Climate change; Disposal costs; Enhanced oil recovery (EOR); Greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Bailey, Webster, Progress in a study of CO2 capture and use for EOR (1991) paper presented at the 41st Canadian Chemical Engineering Conference, , Vancouver, BC., October 7; Chakma, CO2 Separation and recycling — a route to zero net production of CO2 in the Alberta energy industry (1992) Energy Conversion and Management, 5-8, pp. 795-802; Chakma, Jha, CO2 injection with horizontal wells for the enhanced recovery of heavy oils: a comparison of 2D and 3D model experiments.
