Also, as an example of efforts made by Japanese electric utilities, this paper discusses the efforts of Kansai Electric Power Company to prevent global warming. This discussion centers on attempts to make technological breakthroughs, such as studies on CO2 recovery and fixation, and international joint research project on the development of tropical forests regeneration technology. © 1995.",,"Air pollution control; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Hydraulics; International cooperation; Nuclear energy; Recovery; Carbon dioxide emission; Carbon dioxide fixation; Carbon dioxide recovery; Kansai Electric Power Company; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,,"Muto, S.; Environmental Affairs General Office of Plant Siting, Environmental Considerations The Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. 3-22, Nakanoshima 3-chome, Kita-ku, Osaka, 530-70, Japan",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
