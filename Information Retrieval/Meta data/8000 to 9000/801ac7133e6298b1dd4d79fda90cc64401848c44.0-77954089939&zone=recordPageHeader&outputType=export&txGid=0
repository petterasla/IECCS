The development of a subsurface CO2 plume near the middle packer section of the horizontal release was studied using soil-gas and surface flux measurements of CO2. A perfluorocarbon tracer was added to the CO2 released from this section of the horizontal well, and the development of atmospheric plumes of the tracer was studied under various meteorological conditions using horizontal and vertical grids of monitors containing sorbent material to collect the tracer. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using remote sensing for the ultra low level detection of atmospheric plumes of tracers as means to monitor the near surface leakage of sequestered CO2. © 2009 US Government.","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Global climate change; Monitoring; Perfluorocarbons; Tracer gases","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon sequestration; Global climate change; Global climate changes; Perfluorocarbons; Tracer gas; Carbon dioxide; Horizontal wells; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Soil testing; Sorption; Surfaces; Thermal plumes; Climate change; atmospheric plume; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; global climate; halogenated hydrocarbon; monitoring; remote sensing; tracer; Bozeman; Montana; United States",,,,,,"Strazisar, B.R., Wells, A.W., Diehl, J.R., Hammack, R.W., Veloski, G.A., Near surface monitoring for the ZERT shallow CO2 injection project (2009) Int J Greenhouse Gas Control, 3 (6), pp. 736-744; (2007) Carbon Sequestration Technology Roadmap and Program Plan, , U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC: USDOE; Wells, A.W., Diehl, J.R., Bromhal, G., Strazisar, B.R., Wilson, T.H., White, C.M., The use of tracers to assess leakage from the sequestration of CO2 in a depleted oil reservoir, New Mexico, USA (2007) Appl Geochem, 22 (5), pp. 996-1016","Strazisar, B.; National Energy Technology Laboratory, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, United States; email: brian.strazisar@netl.doe.gov",,,,,,,,18666280,,,,"English","Environ.
