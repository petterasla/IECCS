Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been developed to evaluate environmental impact of existing products and existing manufacturing processes, but the current LCA tools are not suitable for the evaluation of whole product lifecycles and cannot evaluate the logistics of product lifecycles, which are crucial factor in designing feasible and efficient product lifecycles. This paper proposes a modelling and simulation environment called Green Production and Logistics Simulator (GPLS) for evaluation and design of green product lifecycles. The proposed environment employs the concepts of modular modelling, model template, Multi-Dimensional Formalism (MDF) and process inventory, and has the ability to model costs, qualities and logistics. MDF defines a paradigm for the explicit representation of physical, behavioural, and operational perspectives or dimensions of the plant, process, and product. This is the basis for the development of simulation environments in which various product lifecycle alternatives are explored with the same simulation models. The case study, in which the PET bottle resin lifecycle was modelled and simulated, was implemented as a software tool and was shown to be convenient and efficient means to evaluate various product lifecycle alternatives.
