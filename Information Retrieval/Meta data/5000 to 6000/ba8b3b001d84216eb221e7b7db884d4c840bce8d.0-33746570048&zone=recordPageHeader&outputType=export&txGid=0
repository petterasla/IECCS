These fears arise because several direct and indirect mechanisms link warming to disease, and because parasite outbreaks are increasing in many taxa. However, this outcome is not a foregone conclusion, as physiological and community-interaction-based mechanisms may inhibit epidemics at warmer temperatures. Here, we explore this thermal-community-ecology-based mechanism, centering on fish predators that selectively prey upon Daphnia infected with a fungal parasite. We used an interplay between a simple model built around this system's biology and laboratory experiments designed to parameterize the model. Through this data-model interaction, we found that a given density of predators can inhibit epidemics as temperatures rise when thermal physiology of the predator scales more steeply than that of the host. This case is met in our fish-Daphnia-fungus system. Furthermore, the combination of steeply scaling parasite physiology and predation-induced mortality can inhibit epidemics at lower temperatures. This effect may terminate fungal epidemics of Daphnia as lakes cool in autumn. Thus, predation and physiology could constrain epidemics to intermediate temperatures (a pattern that we see in our system). More generally, these results accentuate the possibility that warmer temperatures might actually enhance predator control of parasites. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Daphnia; Global warming; Host-parasite; Persistence thresholds; Thermal physiology","crustacean; disease prevalence; epidemic; fish; fungal disease; global warming; predator-prey interaction; temperature effect; animal; article; Daphnia; ecosystem; epidemic; fish; fungus; greenhouse effect; microbiology; physiology; population dynamics; predation; season; temperature; Animals; Daphnia; Disease Outbreaks; Ecosystem; Fishes; Fungi; Greenhouse Effect; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Seasons; Temperature; Daphnia; Fungi",,,,,,"Ahlgren, G., Temperature functions in biology and their application to algal growth constants (1987) Oikos, 49, pp. 177-190; Anderson, P.K., Cunningham, A.A., Patel, N.G., Morales, F.J., Epstein, P.R., Daszak, P., Emerging infectious diseases of plants: Pathogen pollution, climate change and agrotechnology drivers (2004) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 19, pp. 535-544; Bennett, A.F., Lenski, R.E., Mittler, J.E., Evolutionary adaptation to temperature.
