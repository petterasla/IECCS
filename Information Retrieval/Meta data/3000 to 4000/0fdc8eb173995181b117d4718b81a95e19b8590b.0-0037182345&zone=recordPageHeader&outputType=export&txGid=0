Organic carbon is mainly stored in the meadow and steppe soils of the Plateau, which combined, represents 23.2 Pg of C stored in organic form. This represents 23.44% of China's total organic soil-stored carbon and 2.5% of the global pool of soil carbon as of 1996. Carbon emissions from the grassland soils were estimated based on the two major modes of emission: (i) natural soil respiration and (ii) shifts in net C flux to/from soil due to land-use changes and their potential influence on organic matter decomposition. Annual soil respiration-driven CO2 emissions from the grassland soils of the plateau reached 1.17 Pg C year-1, accounting for 26.4% of China's total soil respiration and 1.73% of global soil respiration. Because the grassland area accounts for 1.02% of the global terrestrial land and 16.9% of China's total terrestrial land, this CO2 emission rate is significantly higher than the country's mean annual rate (approx. 4.2 Pg C year-1) and even higher than the global mean rate (approx. 68 Pg C year-1). In the last 30 years, approximately 3.02 Pg C have been emitted from the grassland soils of the plateau due to land-use changes and grassland degradation. The total CO2 emissions rate from the grassland soils of the plateau reached 1.27 Pg C year-1. Protecting grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is of great importance in limiting global climate change. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
