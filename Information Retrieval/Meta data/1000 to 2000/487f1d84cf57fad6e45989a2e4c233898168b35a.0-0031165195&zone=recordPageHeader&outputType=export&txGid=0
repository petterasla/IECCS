Previous optimization studies for climate change have used descriptions of the environmental system which are found to be too unrepresentative of what is known in the scientific community. In this paper an approach is applied which tries to include a more sophisticated model of the environmental system. The resulting continuous dynamic control problem is solved by the application of a set of non-linear optimization techniques to find optimal response strategies to maximize the discounted sum of future consumption while adhering to certain environmental constraints. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","Climate change; CO2; Non-linear optimization","Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Nonlinear control systems; Optimization; Nonlinear optimization; Climate change",,,,,,"Targets and indicators of climate change (1990) Report of Working Group II of the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases (AGGG), , Rijsberman and Swart (eds.), Stockholm Environmental Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; Braddock, R.D., Filar, J.A., Zapert, R., Rotmans, J., Den Elzen, M.G.J., The IMAGE model as a mathematical system (1994) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 18, pp. 234-254. , May; Dowlatabadi, H., Integrated assessment of climate change: An incomplete overview (1994) Integrative Assessment of Mitigation, Impacts, and Adaptation to Climate Change, pp. 105-118. , N.
