In these experiments the CO2 concentration has been increased to double and quadruples the initial concentration, respectively. After 70 a, at the time of CO2 doubling, the model predicts surface air temperature rises by 1.2 and 1.5 K for the globe and the northwestern Pacific Ocean, respectively. The behavior of the quadrupling run is similar: each global and regional mean surface air temperatures increase by 2.8 and 3.0 K at the time of CO2 quadrupling. From the experiments, surface air temperature changes in the northwestern Pacific Ocean will be more distinctive compared with the global average, mainly due to exceptionally large warming and sea level change near the entrance of the Kuroshio extension.","Climate model simulation; Global warming; Northwestern Pacific Ocean","carbon dioxide; climate change; global warming; modeling; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; World",,,,,,"Bettge, T.W., Weatherly, J.W., Washington, W.M., (1996) The CSM Sea Ice Model, , NCAR Technical Note NCAR/TN-425+STR.
