Results indicate that associated with the increasing of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the most prominent signals of global warming locate at high latitudes, and the change of middle and low latitudes, in particular the surface wind is relatively weak which leads to a weak, response of the Pacific subtropical-tropical meridional cell. At the time of atmospheric carbon dioxide doubling, the change of the meridional cell strength is smaller than the amplitude of natural variability.","Global warming; Ocean-atmosphere coupled model; Pacific subtropical-tropical meridional cell",,,,,,"40375029, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","Zhou, T.J., Wang, S.W., Zhang, X.H., Comments on the role of thermohaline circulation in global climate system (2000) Advance in Earth Sciences, 15 (6), pp. 654-660; McPhaden, M.J., Zhang, D., Slowdown of the meridional overturning circulation in the upper Pacific Ocean (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 603-608; Zhang, Y., Wallace, J.M., Battisti, D.S., ENSO-like inter-decadal variability: 1900-1993 (1997) J. dim., 10, pp. 1004-1020; Liu, Z., Huang, B., Cause of tropical Pacific warming trend (2000) Geophys.
