Box 47, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","A large proportion of northern peatlands consists of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs. In these bogs, peat mosses (Sphagnum) and vascular plants occur in an apparent stable equilibrium, thereby sustaining the carbon sink function of the bog ecosystem. How global warming and increased nitrogen (N) deposition will affect the species composition in bog vegetation is still unclear. We performed a transplantation experiment in which mesocosms with intact vegetation were transplanted southward from north Sweden to north-east Germany along a transect of four bog sites, in which both temperature and N deposition increased. In addition, we monitored undisturbed vegetation in control plots at the four sites of the latitudinal gradient. Four growing seasons after transplantation, ericaceous dwarf shrubs had become much more abundant when transplanted to the warmest site which also had highest N deposition. As a result ericoid aboveground biomass in the transplanted mesocosms increased most at the southernmost site, this site also had highest ericoid biomass in the undisturbed vegetation. The two dominant Sphagnum species showed opposing responses when transplanted southward; Sphagnum balticum height increment decreased, whereas S. fuscum height increment increased when transplanted southward. Sphagnum production did not differ significantly among the transplanted mesocosms, but was lowest in the southernmost control plots. The dwarf shrub expansion and increased N concentrations in plant tissues we observed, point in the direction of a positive feedback toward vascular plant-dominance suppressing peat-forming Sphagnum in the long term. However, our data also indicate that precipitation and phosphorus availability influence the competitive balance between Sphagnum, dwarf shrubs and graminoids. © 2010 The Author(s).","Aboveground production; Nitrogen deposition; Nutrient concentrations; Sphagnum; Sweden; Temperature","aboveground biomass; atmospheric deposition; carbon sink; community dynamics; community response; ecosystem function; environmental conditions; global change; growing season; latitudinal gradient; mesocosm; moss; nitrogen; nutrient availability; ombrotrophic environment; precipitation intensity; shrub; transplantation; Germany; Sweden; Bryophyta; Sphagnum; Sphagnum balticum; Sphagnum fuscum; Tracheophyta",,,,,,"Backeus, I.I., Aboveground production and growth dynamics of vascular bog plants in central Sweden (1985) Acta Phytogr Suecica, 74, pp. 1-98; Berendse, F., Competition between plant populations at low and high nutrient supplies (1994) Oikos, 71, pp. 253-260; Berendse, F., Breemen, N., Rydin, H., Buttler, A., Heijmans, M.M.P.D., Hoosbeek, M.R., Lee, J.A., Wallen, B., Raised atmospheric CO2 levels and increased N deposition cause shifts in plant species composition and production in Sphagnum bogs (2001) Global Change Biol, 7, pp. 591-598; Bouwman, A., van Vuuren, D., Derwent, R., Posch, M., A global analysis of acidification and eutrophication of terrestrial ecosystems (2002) Water Air Soil Pollut, 141, pp. 349-382; Bragazza, L., A climatic threshold triggers the die-off of peat mosses during an extreme heat wave (2008) Global Change Biol, 14, pp. 2688-2695; Bragazza, L., Freeman, C., Jones, T., Rydin, H., Limpens, J., Fenner, N., Ellis, T., Toberman, H., Atmospheric nitrogen deposition promotes carbon loss from peat bogs (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 19386-19389; Bragazza, L., Siffi, C., Iacumin, P., Gerdol, R., Mass loss and nutrient release during litter decay in peatland: The role of microbial adaptability to litter chemistry (2007) Soil Biol Biochem, 39, pp. 257-267; Breeuwer, A., Heijmans, M.M.P.D., Gleichman, M., Robroek, B.J.M., Berendse, F., Response of Sphagnum species mixtures to increased temperature and nitrogen availability (2009) Plant Ecol, 204, pp. 97-111; Breeuwer, A., Heijmans, M.M.P.D., Robroek, B.J.M., Berendse, F., The effect of temperature on growth and competition between Sphagnum species (2008) Oecologia, 156, pp. 155-167; Breeuwer, A., Heijmans, M.M.P.D., Robroek, B.J.M., Limpens, J., Berendse, F., The effect of increased temperature and nitrogen deposition on decomposition in bogs (2008) Oikos, 117, pp. 1258-1268; Breeuwer, A., Robroek, B.J.M., Limpens, J., Heijmans, M.M.P.D., Schouten, M.G.C., Berendse, F., Decreased summer water table depth affects peatland vegetation (2009) Basic Appl Ecol, 10, pp. 330-339; Bret-Harte, M.S., Garci, E.A., Sacre, V.M., Whorley, J.R., Wagner, J.L., Lipper, S.C., Chapin III, F.S., Plant and soil responses to neighbour removal and fertilization in Alaskan tussock tundra (2004) J Ecol, 92, pp. 635-647; Bubier, J.L., Moore, T.R., Bledzki, L.A., Effects of nutrient addition on vegetation and carbon cycling in an ombrotrophic bog (2007) Global Change Biol, 13, pp. 1168-1186; Chapin III, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Laundre, J.A., Responses of arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Clymo, R.S., The growth of Sphagnum: Methods of measurement (1970) J Ecol, 58, pp. 13-49; Clymo, R.S., Hayward, P.M., The ecology of Sphagnum (1982) Bryophyte Ecology, pp. 229-289. , A.
