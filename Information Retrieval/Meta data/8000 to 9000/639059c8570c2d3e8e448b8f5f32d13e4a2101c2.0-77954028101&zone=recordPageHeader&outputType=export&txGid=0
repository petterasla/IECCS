Response of the East China Sea (ECS) to the global warming trend, however, is not well understood because of sparse long-term observation. In this paper, hydrographic observation data of 1957-1996 are collected and reviewed to study climatological variability in northern ECS. Significant warming trends are found in both summer and winter. In summer, the average SST is about 0.46°C higher during the period of 1977-1996 than that of 1957-1976, and the Taiwan Warm Current Water (TWCW) was strengthened. In winter, despite of the cooling effect in the coastal areas adjacent to the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Estuary (CRE), the average SST increase was about 0.53°C during the same period. The causes of this SST warming up in summer are different from in winter. The warming trend and intensification of the TWCW in summer were primarily influenced by the strengthening of the Kuroshio transport, while the warming in winter was mainly induced by the variability of the climate system. © 2009 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","climate change; East China Sea; global warming; long-term variability; sea surface temperature",,,,,,,"Cai, R.S., Chen, J.L., Huang, R.H., The response of marine environment in the offshore area of China and its adjacent ocean to recent global climate change (2006) Chinese Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, 30 (5), pp. 019-033. , In Chinese with English abstract; Graham, N.E., Simulation of recent global temperature trends (1995) Science, 267, pp. 666-671; Gu, D., Philander, S.G.H., Interdecadal climate fluctuations that depend on exchanges between the tropics and extratropics (1997) Science, 275, pp. 805-807; Guo, Q.Y., Cai, J.N., Shao, X.M., Interdecadal variability of East Asian summer monsoon and its impact on the climate of China (2003) Acta Geographic a Sinica, 58 (4), pp. 569-576. , In Chinese with English abstract; Kawamura, R., A rotated EOF analysis of global SST variability with interannual and interdecadal scales (1994) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 24, pp. 707-715; Latif, M., Barnett, T.P., Causes of decadal climate variability over the North Pacific and North America (1994) Science, 266, pp. 634-637; Li, Y.F., Guo, P.F., Li, G.Y., The EOF analysis of the sea surface temperature in the East China Sea (2007) Transactions of Oceanology and Limnology, 2007 (3), pp. 1-4. , In Chinese with English abstract; Mao, H.L., Ren, Y.W., Sun, G.D., Preliminary analyses on hydrographic features and water systems in the Southern Yellow Sea and northern East China Sea (28°~37°N) in summer (1965) Studia Marina Sinica, 1965 (1), pp. 23-77. , In Chinese; Mao, H.L., Ren, Y.W., Sun, G.D., Preliminary analyses on hydrographic features and water systems in the Southern Yellow Sea and northern East China Sea (28°~37°N) in winter (1965) Studia Marina Sinica, 1965 (1), pp. 78-125. , In Chinese; Ni, D.H., Sun, Z.B., Chen, H.S., Spatial/temporal features of SSTA in Kuroshio current region and its relations to general circulation (2003) Journal of Nanjing Institute of Meteorology, 26 (6), pp. 740-748. , In Chinese with English abstract; Tang, X.H., Wang, F., Analyses on hydrographic structure in the Changjiang River Estuary adjacent waters (2004) Studia Marina Sinica, 46, pp. 42-66. , In Chinese with English abstract; Trenberth, K.E., Recent observed interdecadal climate changes in the North Hemisphere (1990) Bulletin of American Meteorology Society, 71 (7), pp. 988-993; Trenberth, K.E., Hoar, T.J., The 1990-1995 ENSO event: longest on record (1996) Geophysical Research Letters, 23 (1), pp. 57-60; Weng, X.C., Zhang, Q.L., Yang, Y.L., The Kuroshio heat transport in the East China Sea and its relation to the precipitation in the rainy season in the Huanghuai Plain area (1996) Oceanologia Et Limnologia Sinica, 27 (3), pp. 237-245; Yan, H.M., Duan, W., Xiao, Z.N., A study on relation between East Asian winter monsoon and climate change during raining season in China (2003) Journal of Tropical Meteorology, 19 (4), pp. 367-376; Yan, J.Y., Li, J.L., Temperature variability in the East China Sea and its adjacent areas for the last hundred years (1997) Acta Oceanologica Sinica, 19 (6), pp. 121-126; Yu, F., Xu, Y., Study of long-term variational trend of sea surface temperature in the East China Sea.
