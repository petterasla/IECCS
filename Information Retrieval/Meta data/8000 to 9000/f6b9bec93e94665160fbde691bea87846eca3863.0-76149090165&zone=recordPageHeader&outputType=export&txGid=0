Without any rain, to capture CO2 produced from gasoline requires adding about $1 to the per-gallon pump-price to cover irrigation costs, using reverse osmosis (RO), desalinated, sea water. Such mature technology is economically competitive with the currently favored, untested, power-plant Carbon Capture (and deep underground, or under-ocean) Sequestration (CCS). Afforestation sequesters CO2, mostly as easily stored wood, both from distributed sources (automotive, aviation, etc., that CCS cannot address) and from power plants. Climatological feasibility and sustainability of such irrigated forests, and their potential global impacts are explored using a general circulation model (GCM). Biogeophysical feedback is shown to stimulate considerable rainfall over these forests, reducing desalination and irrigation costs; economic value of marketed, renewable, forest biomass, further reduces costs; and separately, energy conservation also reduces the size of the required forests and therefore their total capital and operating costs. The few negative climate impacts outside of the forests are discussed, with caveats. If confirmed with other GCMs, such irrigated, subtropical afforestation probably provides the best, near-term route to complete control of green-house-gas-induced, global warming. © 2009 The Author(s).",,"Atmospheric CO; Capital and operating costs; Carbon capture; Climate impacts; Complete control; Distributed sources; Economic values; Forest biomass; General circulation model; Global impacts; Irrigation costs; Cost reduction; Desalination; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Oceanography; Operating costs; Rain; Reforestation; Renewable energy resources; Seawater; Water filtration; Irrigation; afforestation; atmospheric general circulation model; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; desalination; economic analysis; environmental economics; environmental protection; global warming; irrigation system; osmosis; sustainable forestry; Chelation; Energy Conservation; Forestation; Gasoline; Greenhouse Gases; Meteorology; Rain; Sea Water; Seasonal Variation; Australia; Sahara",,,,,,"Abu-Zeid, K., Wagdy, A., Elbadawy, O., Abdel-Meguid, A., (2004) State of the Water in the Arab Region, , http://www.idrc.ca/uploads/user-S/11114806841arabstatewater1.pdf, CEDARE; Allen, R.J., Monsoon and teleconnection variability over Australasia during the southern hemisphere summers of 1973-77 (1983) Mon Weather Rev, 111, pp. 113-142; Alley, R., (2007) IPCC Summary for Policy Makers, , http://www.ipcc.ch, IPCC Secretariat, Geneva; Anthes, R.A., Enhancement of convective precipitation by mesoscale variations in vegetative covering in semiarid regions (1984) J Clim Appl Meteorol, 23, pp. 541-554; Anthes, R.A., The global trajectory (1993) Bul Am Meteo Soc, 74, pp. 1121-1130. , http://www.ucar.edu/pres/traject.html; Axtell, R.L., McRae, G.J., Changing how we discount to make public policy more responsive to citizens' time preferences (2006) Regulatory Analysis 06-01 AEI Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, , http://www.aei-brookings.org/publications/abstract.php?pid=1049; Bala, G., Caldeira, K., Wickett, M., Phillips, T.J., Lobell, D.B., Delire, C., Mirin, A., Combined climate and carbon-cycle effects of large-scale deforestation (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 104, pp. 6550-6555; Battle, M., Bender, M.L., Trans, P.P., White, J.W.C., Ellis, J.T., Conway, T., Francey, R.J., Global carbon sinks and their variability inferred from atmospheric O2 and?13C (2000) Science, 287, pp. 2467-2470; Benyon, R.G., Nighttime water use in an irrigated Eucalyptus grandis plantation (1999) Tree Physiol, 19, pp. 853-859; Beyerle, U., Rueedi, J., Leuenberger, M., Evidence for periods of wetter and cooler climate in the Sahel between 6 and 40 kyr BP derived from groundwater (2003) Geophys Res Lett, 30, pp. 1173-1177; Braconnot, P., Joussaime, S., Marti, O., Denoblet-Ducoudre, N., Synergistic feedbacks from ocean and vegetation on the African monsoon response to mid-Holocene insolation (1999) Geophys Res Lett, 26, pp. 2481-2484; Bradstock, R., Williams, J., Gill, O., (2002) Des: Flammable Australia.
