"Hanninen H.","Effects of climatic change on trees from cool and temperate regions: an ecophysiological approach to modelling of bud burst phenology",1995,"Canadian Journal of Botany","73","2",,"183","199",,,,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-0028887197&partnerID=40&md5=b076c5510333b3abef22053dadea618c",,"Hanninen, H.","Three ecophysiological aspects affecting the timing of bud burst are considered: 1) effects of environmental factors on the rest status of the bud, 2) effect of rest status on the ability for bud burst, 3) and direct effect of air temperature on the rate of development towards bud burst. A total of 96 hypothetical models were synthesized by combining submodels presented in the literature. The models were tested in two experiments with saplings of Pinus sylvestris growing in experimental chambers at their natural site in E Finland. Elevation of the air temperature hastened bud burst; elevation of the concentration of CO2 did not affect it. Several models accurately predicted the timing of bud burst for natural conditions but too early for bud burst at the elevated temperatures. This suggests that 1) the risk of a premature bud burst with subsequent frost damage, as a result of climatic warming, was overestimated in a recent simulation study, and 2) bud burst observations in natural conditions alone are not sufficient for testing these mechanistic models. A photoperiod submodel for rest break was tested by exposing the saplings to short-day conditions. The short-day treatment had only a minor effect on timing of bud burst. -from Author",,"bud burst; climatic change; ecophysiology; phenology; Finland; Pinus sylvestris",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00084026,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028887197
