Global climate change issues have raised new concerns about nitrogen (N) management as it relates to crop production even though there may not be an immediate threat to water quality. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions are frequently considered the primary cause of global climate change, but under anaerobic conditions, animals can contribute by expelling methane (CH 4) as do soil microbes. In terms of the potential for global climate change, CH 4 is ∼ 25 times more harmful than CO 2. This differential effect is minuscule compared to when nitrous oxide (N 2O) is released into the atmosphere because it is ∼ 300 times more harmful than CO 2. N 2O losses from soil have been positively correlated with residual N (nitrate, NO 3 -) concentrations in soil. It stands to reason that phytoremediation via nitrate scavenger crops is one approach to help protect air quality, as well as soil and water quality. Winter wheat was inserted into a seed corn/soybean rotation to utilize soil nitrate and thereby reduce the potential for nitrate leaching and N 2O emissions. The net effect of the 2001-2003 relay cropping sequence was to produce three crops in two years, scavenge 130 kg N/ha from the root zone, produce an extra 2 Mg residue/ha, and increase producer profitability by ∼ $ 250/ha. © 2005 Verlag der Zeitschritt für Naturforschung.","Agriculture; Air Quality; Nitrogen Management","fertilizer; nitrogen; agriculture; conference paper; crop; metabolism; soil; soil pollutant; soybean; standard; United States; water pollutant; water pollution; wheat; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Fertilizers; Nebraska; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Soybeans; Triticum; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Animalia; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Fertilizers; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Soil Pollutants; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"Davidson, E.A., Fluxes of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from terrestrial ecosystems (1991) Microbial Production and Consumption of Greenhouse Gases: Methane, Nitrogen Oxides and Halomethanes, pp. 219-235. , (Rogers J.
