Here, experimental and modeling results are used to quantify the net greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction from substituting a household anaerobic digester for traditional energy sources in Sichuan, China. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and radial plume mapping were used to estimate the mass flux of fugitive methane emissions from active digesters. Using household energy budgets, the net improvement in GHG emissions associated with biogas installation was estimated using global warming commitment (GWC) as a consolidated measure of the warming effects of GHG emissions from cooking. In all scenarios biogas households had lowerGWCthan nonbiogas households, by as much as 54%. Even biogas households with methane leakage exhibited lower GWC than nonbiogas households, by as much as 48%. Based only on the averted GHG emissions over 10 years, the monetary value of a biogas installation was conservatively estimated at US$28.30 ($16.07 ton -1 CO 2- eq), which is available to partly offset construction costs. The interaction of biogas installation programs with policies supporting improved stoves, renewable harvesting of biomass, and energy interventions with substantial health cobenefits are discussed. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Anaerobic digester; Construction costs; Energy source; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Household energy; Key parts; Mass flux; Methane emissions; Methane leakage; Modeling results; Monetary value; Organic wastes; Radial plume mappings; Renewable energies; Rural energy; Sichuan , China; Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy; Absorption spectroscopy; Biogas; Emission control; Energy conversion; Energy harvesting; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Pulp digesters; Sewage; Renewable energy resources; biogas; methane; anoxic conditions; atomic absorption spectroscopy; biogas; carbon emission; energy budget; global warming; greenhouse gas; policy making; renewable resource; rural area; rural energy; sanitation; sustainable development; absorption spectroscopy; anaerobic digestion; article; carbon footprint; China; cost; energy; greenhouse effect; household; plume; rural area; sanitation; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Anaerobiosis; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Biofuels; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Garbage; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Housing; Methane; Sanitation; China; Sichuan",,"methane, 74-82-8; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Haines, A., Smith, K.R., Anderson, D., Epstein, P.R., McMichael, A.J., Roberts, I., Wilkinson, P., Woods, J., Policies for accelerating access to clean energy, improving health, advancing development, and mitigating climate change (2007) Lancet, 370 (9594), pp. 1264-1281. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61257-4, PII S0140673607612574; Zhang, J., Mauzerall, D.L., Zhu, T., Liang, S., Ezzati, M., Remais, J.V., Environmental health in China: Progress towards clean air and safe water (2010) Lancet, 375 (9720), pp. 1110-9; Wilkinson, P., Smith, K.R., Davies, M., Adair, H., Armstrong, B.G., Barrett, M., Bruce, N., Chalabi, Z., Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: Household energy (2009) Lancet, 374 (9705), pp. 1917-29; Cruz, R., Harasawa, H., Lal, M., Wu, S., Anokhin, Y., Punsalmaa, B., Honda, Y., Asia, N., (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
