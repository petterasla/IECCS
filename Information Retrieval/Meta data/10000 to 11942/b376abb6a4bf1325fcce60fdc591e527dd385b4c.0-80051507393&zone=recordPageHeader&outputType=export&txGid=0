The reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions represents a way to avoid significant environmental degradation by climate change. The use of renewable energy offers a ""clean"" alternative for energy production, which allows considerable reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissons. Romania, as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and of the Kyoto Protocol, and also as a EU member, committed to contribute to the global effort for GHG emissions mitigation. Starting from the significant potential of Romania's hydropower resources, the following paper presents an estimation of GHG emissions reduction by using hydropower energy.","Climate changes; Ghg emissions; Hydropower; Renewable energy",,,,,,,"Strategy For the Promotion of Renewable Sources of Energy, , Governmental Decision no. 1535/2003; Romania's fifth National Communication on Climate Change, January 2010http://unfccc.int/ghg_data/ghg_data_unfccc/ghg_profiles/items/4625.php, UNFCCC databaseDevelopment Strategy of SC HIDROELECTRICA SA for the period 2005-2025(2009), SC Hidroelectrica SA Environmental Report(2010), The National Action Plan in the field of Energy from renewable sourcesThe decision of the Commission/2004 for laying down guidelines for the monitoring and reporting emissions of greenhouse gases in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the CouncilRevised 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, UNFCCCCalanter, P., Serban, O., Dragomir, A., Economic and Environmental Aspects On Energy Alternatives For a Clean Air - Wind Farms Proceedings of Air and water-components of the environment conference, pp. 61-67. , Cluj-Napoca, ISSN: 2067-743X, Babes-Bolyai, March 2011, Cluj-Napoca; Resteanu, C., Andreica, M., Andreica, C., Miclǎus, I., Remote Optimization In Petrochemistry Proceedings of the 9th WSEAS International Conference On Automatic Control, pp. 284-289. , Modelling and Simulation, May 27-29, 2007, Istanbul, Turkey,.
