Lake highstands occurred at 10.5 and 6.9 ka, with an intervening lowstand at 9 ka. The 10.5 ka highstand occurred during the well-known Killarney-Younger Dryas cold interval (11.2-10.0 ka) in response to decreased evaporation and increased precipitation. The driest interval of the early-middle Holocene occurred ∼9 ka, at the time of maximum summer solar insolation. A second highstand occurred during the Hypsithermal (∼8.5-5.5 ka) in response to increased precipitation at a time when the interior of North America underwent maximum aridity. This out-ofphase relationship between northeastern North America and the midcontinent during the Hypsithermal may have been a consequence of a northward shift of the jet stream and a change of precipitation patterns in response to increased global warmth. If the Hypsithermal can be used as an analog for potential global warming, the northeastern United States may experience future increases in regional precipitation.",,"aridity; highstand; Holocene; Holocene lake; Hypsithermal; jet stream; lake level; palaeoclimate; USA, New York, Finger Lakes, Owasco Lake",,,,,,"Aravena, R., Warner, B.G., MacDonald, G.M., Hank, K.I., Carbon isotope composition of lake sediments in relation to lake productivity and radiocarbon dating (1992) Quaternary Research, 37, pp. 333-345; Climatic changes of the last 18,000 years: Observations and model simulations (1988) Science, 241, pp. 1043-1052; Forman, S.L., Oglesby, R., Markgraf, V., Stafford, T., Paleoclimatic significance of late Quaternary eolian deposition on the Piedmont and High Plains, central United States (1995) Global and Planetary Change, 11, pp. 35-55; Harrison, S.P., Lake levels and climatic change in eastern North America (1989) Climate Dynamics, 3, pp. 157-167; Larsen, E., Sejrup, H.P., Johnson, S.J., Knudsen, K.L., Do Greenland ice cores reflect NW European interglacial climate variations?
