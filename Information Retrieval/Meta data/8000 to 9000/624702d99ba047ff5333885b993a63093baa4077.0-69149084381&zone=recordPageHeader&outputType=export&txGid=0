There is a clear lack of general rules regarding the impacts of global warming on biota. Here, we present a metaanalysis of the effect of climate change on body size of ectothermic aquatic organisms (bacteria, phyto- and zooplankton, and fish) from the community to the individual level. Using long-term surveys, experimental data and published results, we show a significant increase in the proportion of small-sized species and young age classes and a decrease in size-at-age. These results are in accordance with the ecological rules dealing with the temperature-size relationships (i.e., Bergmann's rule, James' rule and Temperature-Size Rule). Our study provides evidence that reduced body size is the third universal ecological response to global warming in aquatic systems besides the shift of species ranges toward higher altitudes and latitudes and the seasonal shifts in life cycle events.","Biological scale; Body size; Climate change; Ectotherms; Metaanalysis","altitude; aquatic environment; aquatic species; article; bacterium; body size; brown trout; climate change; fish; greenhouse effect; latitude; mesocosm; nonhuman; priority journal; zooplankton; animal; body size; ecosystem; female; isolation and purification; phytoplankton; Animals; Bacteria; Body Size; Ecosystem; Female; Fishes; Greenhouse Effect; Phytoplankton",,,,,,"Parmesan, C., Yohe, G., A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 37-42; Root, T.L., Fingerprints of global warming on wild animals and plants (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 57-60; Walther, G.R., Ecological responses to recent climate change (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 389-395; Pearman, P.B., Prediction of plant species distributions across six millennia (2008) Ecol Lett, 11, pp. 357-369; Durant, J.M., Hjermann, D.O., Ottersen, G., Stenseth, N.C., Climate and the match or mismatch between predator requirements and resource availability (2007) Clim Res, 33, pp. 271-283; Cushing, D., (1974) Sea Fisheries Research, pp. 399-412. , eds Jones H Elek Science, London, pp; Durant, J.M., Timing and abundance as key mechanisms affecting trophic interactions in variable environments (2005) Ecol Lett, 8, pp. 952-958; Jonzen, N., Hedenstrom, A., Lundberg, P., Climate change and the optimal arrival of migratory birds (2007) Proc R Soc London Ser B, 274, pp. 269-274; Arendt, J., Ecological correlates of body size in relation to cell size and cell number: Patterns in flies, fish, fruits and foliage (2007) Biol Rev, 82, pp. 241-256; Millien, V., Ecotypic variation in the context of global climate change: Revisiting the rules (2006) Ecol Lett, 9, pp. 853-869; Atkinson, D., Sibly, R.M., Why are organisms usually bigger in colder environments?
