Here we quantify coral bleaching in Barbados at six sites on the island's sheltered west and exposed southwest coasts, including nearshore fringing and patch reefs and offshore bank reef habitats. Onset of coral bleaching occurred in late August 2005 and persisted for many months after temperatures cooled. All reef habitats and virtually all coral taxa were affected, with an average of 70.6% of all colonies bleaching. Nearshore reefs (<10 m depth) were affected more severely than offshore deeper reefs (>15 m) with an average of 80.6% of all coral colonies bleaching compared with 60.5% on the latter. Inter-species variation in susceptibility to bleaching was marked with >90% of colonies bleaching in some species whilst <10% bleached in others. Follow-up surveys revealed low coral mortality, with an overall mean of 3.8% partial colony death across all species and reefs by February 2006. However, bleached condition has persisted with a mean of 37.7% of all coral colonies still bleached after 5 1/2 months, indicating that loss of live coral is likely to continue for some time. This event represents the most severe bleaching episode ever witnessed on Barbados' reefs and emphasises the vulnerability of small island states, with a high reliance on healthy coral reef ecosystem services, to elevated sea water temperatures associated with climate variability and global climate change. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Ecosystems; Thermal effects; Water; Coral bleaching; Ecosystem services; Offshore bank reef habitats; Reefs; climate change; coral bleaching; coral reef; fringing reef; global climate; interspecific variation; mortality; nearshore environment; quantitative analysis; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Barbados; Caribbean Islands; Lesser Antilles; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Aronson, R.B., Precht, W.F., Conservation, precaution, and Caribbean reefs (2006) Coral Reefs, 25, pp. 441-450; Aronson, R.B., Precht, W.F., Toscano, M.A., Koltes, K.H., The 1998 bleaching event and its aftermath on a coral reef in Belize (2002) Mar Biol, 141, pp. 435-447; Berkelmans, R., De'Ath, G., Kininmonth, S., Skirving, W.J., A comparison of the 1998 and 2002 coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef: Spatial correlation, patterns, and predictions (2004) Coral Reefs, 23, pp. 74-83; Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching: Causes and consequences (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. 129-138; Bruno, J.F., Siddon, C.E., Witman, J.D., Colin, P.I., El Nino related coral bleaching in Palau, Western Caroline Islands (2001) Coral Reefs, 20, pp. 127-136; Studies on Caribbean coral bleaching, 1995-96 (1997) Proceedings 8th International Coral Reef Symposium, pp. 673-678. , CARICOMP Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Balboa, Panama; (2001) CARICOMP Methods Manual, Levels 1 & 2: Manual of Methods for Mapping and Monitoring of Physical and Biological Parameters in the Coastal Zone of the Caribbean, p. 91. , CARICOMP.
