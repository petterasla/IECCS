The roadmap developed by the U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) for government, industry, and academia to begin setting research and development (R & D) direction related to carbon sequestration is outlined. Further, several areas of research as well as some of the chemical engineering challenges in this field are explored.",,"Air pollution control; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon; Economic and social effects; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Engineering research; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Research and development management; Technology transfer; Carbon sequestration; Exhaust streams; Greenhouse gas emission; Mitigation strategies; Climate change",,,,,,"International energy outlook 2000 (2000), p. 1. , www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/tbl_1.html, DOE/EIA-0484(2000), U.S. DOE, Energy Information Administration, Washington, DC; (March)Framework convention on climate change (1992), www.unfccc.de/resource/conv/conv_004.html, (May)Kim, S.H., Edmonds, J.A., Potential for advanced carbon capture and sequestration technologies in a climate constrained world (2000), p. 24. , PNNL-13095, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Washington, DC; (Feb.)Kripowicz, R.S., Remarks to the carbon sequestration workshop (1999), www.fe.doe.gov/remarks/99_krip_seqconf.html, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Gaithersburg, MD; (Sept. 14)Carbon sequestration R&D program plan: FY1999-FY2000 (1999), p. 2. , www.fe.doe.gov/coal_power/sequestration/reports/programplans/99/index/sh tml, U.S. DOE, National Energy Technology Lab, Pittsburgh, PA; (June)Carbon sequestration reserch and development (1999), www.fe.doe.gov/coal_power/sequestration, DOE/SC/FE-1, U.S. DOE, Office of Science and Office of Fossil Energy, Washington, DC; (Dec.)Kripowicz, R.S., Sequestration: New technology options for a new century (1998) Fourth International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies, Interlaken, Switzerland, , www.fe.doe.gov/remarks/98_carbon.html, (Aug. 31); DOE selects eight national lab projects as research to capture, store greenhouse gases expands (2000) DOE Fossil Energy Techline, , www.fe.doe.gov/techline/tl_seqnatlb1.html, (Feb. 18); Energy Dept. launches thirteen new research projects to capture, store greenhouse gases (2000) DOE Fossil Energy Techline, , www.fe.doe.gov/techline/tl_seq_ind1.html, (July 21); Fuels decarbonization and carbon sequestration: Report of a workshop (1997), www.princeton.edu/~ceesdoe/, Socolow, R., ed.; Publication PU/CEES 302, Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJLeci, C.L., Development requirements for absorption processes for effective CO2 capture from power plants (1997) Energy Conversion and Management, 38 (SUPPL.), pp. S45-S50; Herzog, H.J., Drake, E.M., CO2 capture, reuse, and sequestration technologies for mitigating global climate change (1998) 23rd International Technical Conference on Coal Utilization and Fuel Systems, Clearwater, FL, , sponsored by U.S. Dept. of Energy, Federal Energy Technology Center, Pittsburgh, PA (Mar. 9-13); Climate change 1995 - impacts, adaptations, and mitigation of climate change: Scientific-technical analyses (1996), Watson, R.
