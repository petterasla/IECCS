We designed an experiment where production of greenhouse gases was registered at the time of maximum net development of N2O. We made additions of biodegradable carbon (glucose) and/or NO3- to sediment and soil slurries and incubated them at four temperatures (4, 13, 20, 28 °C). Gas production from both substrates was positively correlated with temperature. We also found that the sediment produced more N2O than the soil. N2O production in sediment was NO3- limited, whereas in soil carbon availability was lower and only combined additions of NO3- and glucose supported increased N2O development. CH4 production was generally low and did not differ between soil and sediment. Nor did glucose addition increase CH4 rates. The results suggest that neither soil nor sediment environment did support development of methanogenic populations. There were no clear effects of NO3- on CH4 production. However, the highest records of CH4 were found in incubations with low N2O production, which indicates that N2O might be toxic to methanogens. In summary, our study showed that transforming meadows into FSWWs implies a risk of increased N2O emissions. This does not seem to be valid for CH4. However, since N2O is almost always produced wherever NO3- is denitrified, increased N2O production in wetlands leads to reduced rates in downstream environments. Hence, we conclude that when balancing NO3- retention and global warming aspects, we find no reason to discourage future creation or restoration of wetlands. © 2008.","Glucose; Methane; Nitrate; Nitrous oxide; Wetland","Carbon loadings; Gas productions; Glucose addition; Nitrate; Nitrous oxide; Soil carbon; Wetland; Anesthetics; Carbon dioxide; Fourier transforms; Gas pipelines; Gas producers; Gases; Global warming; Glucose; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Methane; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Sedimentology; Surface waters; Wetlands; Soils; carbon; gas production; laboratory method; meadow; nitrous oxide; sediment; slurry; surface water; wetland",,,,,,"Achtnich, C., Bak, F., Conrad, R., Competition for electron donors among nitrate reducers, ferric iron reducers, sulfate reducers, and methanogens in anoxic paddy soil (1995) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 19, pp. 65-72; Augustin, J., Merbach, W., Rogasik, J., Factors influencing nitrous oxide and methane emissions from minerotrophic fens in northeast Germany (1998) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 28, pp. 1-4; Azam, F., Müller, C., Weiske, A., Benckiser, G., Nitrification and denitrification as sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide - role of oxidizable carbon and applied nitrogen (2002) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 35, pp. 54-61; Clarens, M., Bernet, N., Delgenès, J.-P., Moletta, R., Effects of nitrogen oxides and denitrification by Pseudomonas stuzeri on acetotrophic methanogenesis by Methanosarcina mazei (1998) FEMS Microbiology Ecology, 25, pp. 271-276; Conrad, R., Soil microorganisms as controllers of atmospheric trace gases (H2, CO, CH4, OCS, N2O, and NO) (1996) Microbiological Reviews, 60 (4), pp. 609-640; Garcia-Montiel, D.C., Melillo, J.M., Steudler, P.A., Cerri, C.C., Piccolo, M.C., Carbon limitations to nitrous oxide emissions in a humid tropical forest of the Brazilian Amazon (2003) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 38, pp. 267-272; García-Ruiz, J.M., Pattinson, S.N., Whitton, B.A., Nitrous oxide production in the river Swale-Ouse, North-East England (1999) Water Research, 33, pp. 1231-1237; Granli, T., Bøckman, O., Nitrous oxide from agriculture (1994) Norwegian Journal of Agricultural Sciences, SUPPL. 12; Groffman, P.M., Gold, A.J., Addy, K., Nitrous oxide production in riparian zones and its importance to national emission inventories (2000) Chemosphere, 2, pp. 291-299; IPCC, Atmospheric chemistry and greenhouse gases (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
