A software system has been developed to calculate bacterial yield coefficients from stoichiometry under different anaerobic bioprocess conditions. Kinetic constants, i.e., the reaction rate constant and Monod half-velocity coefficient, were determined from batch experimental data using Conreg, a software system for constrained nonlinear regression. Additional experiments were performed to evaluate the usefulness of the Inhibition Coefficient model to predict toxicity of ammonia and methylene chloride in anaerobic batch systems. The integrated approach to biokinetics and stoichiometry and the software developed for this purpose should help engineers quickly evaluate a wide variety of design options for anaerobic treatment systems under both toxic and non-toxic conditions. Other useful applications include prediction of natural rates of methane (a gas causing global warming) formation in rice paddies. © 1994.","ammonia; anaerobic; Biokinetics; methane; methylene chloride; modeling; stoichiometry","Bacteria; Computer aided analysis; Computer applications; Computer software; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Reaction kinetics; Regression analysis; Toxicity; Anaerobic treatment processes; Bacterial yield coefficients; Biokinetics; Inhibition coefficient model; Kinetic constants; Monod half velocity coefficient; Reaction rate constants; Software package Conreg; Stoichiometry; Biochemical engineering; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,,,,,"Banerjee, Garg, Goel, Measurement of toxicity of industrial waters (1969) Proc. 3rd Mid-Atlantic Waste Conference, p. 305. , College Park, MD; Bhattacharya, Parkin, Toxic substances in methane fermentation systems: Fate and effect on process kinetics (1986) National Science Foundation, Report No. CEE-83–00687; Bhattacharya, Innovative biological processes for treatment of hazardous Waste (1990) HMCRI's 11th annual national conference Superfund '90, , Washington, D.C., November 26, 1990, Presented at; Bhattacharya, Parkin, The effect of ammonia on methane fermentation processes (1989) Jour.
