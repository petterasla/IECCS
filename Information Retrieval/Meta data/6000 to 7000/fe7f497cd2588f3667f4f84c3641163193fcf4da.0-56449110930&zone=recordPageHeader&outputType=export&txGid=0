The alternatives typically substitute petroleum with vegetable-based components and/or deliver minimum quantities of lubricant in gas rather than water, with the former strategy being more prevalent than the latter. A comparative life cycle assessment of water- and gas-based systems has shown that delivery of lubricants in air rather than water can reduce solid waste by 60%, water use by 90%, and aquatic toxicity by 80%, while virtually eliminating occupational health concerns. However, air-delivery of lubricants cannot be used for severe machining operations due to limitations of cooling and lubricant delivery. For such operations, lubricants delivered in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) are effective while maintaining the health and environmental advantages of air-based systems. Although delivery conditions were found to significantly influence the environmental burdens of all fluids, energy consumption was relatively constant under expected operating conditions. Global warming potential (GWP) increased when delivering lubricants in gas rather than water though all classes of MWFs have low GWP compared with other factory operations. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of increased GWP when switching to gas-based MWFs is a reasonable tradeoff for definite and large reductions in aquatic toxicity, water use, solid waste, and occupational health risks. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution; Biochemical oxygen demand; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Gases; Global warming; Health; Industrial hygiene; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Lubricants; Occupational risks; Solid lubricants; Solid wastes; Supercritical fluid extraction; Toxicity; Water supply; Energy utilization; Fluids; Aquatic toxicities; Comparative life cycle assessments; Energy consumptions; Environmental burdens; Environmentally adapted; Global warming potentials; Health impacts; Machining operations; Metalworking Fluids; Occupational health risks; Occupational healths; Operating conditions; Relatively constants; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Water uses; Health risks; Lubricants; carbon dioxide; lubricating agent; water; carbon dioxide; comparative study; energy use; global warming; health impact; health risk; life cycle analysis; occupational exposure; petroleum; reduction; solid waste; water use; air pollutant; article; atmospheric deposition; biodegradability; energy consumption; gas; greenhouse effect; life cycle; occupational health; pollution monitoring; risk reduction; solid waste; supercritical fluid; waste minimization; water contamination; Humans; Industrial Oils; Industrial Waste; Inorganic Chemicals; Lubricants; Metallurgy; Occupational Health; Petroleum; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water; Aquatic toxicity; Comparative life cycle assessment; Environmental burdens; Environmentally adapted; Global warming potential; Health impact; Life cycle emissions; Machining operations; Metalworking Fluids; Occupational health; Occupational health risk; Operating condition; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Water use",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; water, 7732-18-5; Industrial Waste; Inorganic Chemicals; Lubricants; Petroleum; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Byers, J., (2006) Metalworking Fluids, , 2nd ed, Marcel Dekker, Inc, New York; Skerlos, S.J., Rajagopalan, N., DeVor, R.E., Kapoor, S.G., Angspatt, V.D., Microfiltration of Polyoxyalkylene Metalworking Fluid Additives using Aluminum Oxide Membranes (2001) J.
