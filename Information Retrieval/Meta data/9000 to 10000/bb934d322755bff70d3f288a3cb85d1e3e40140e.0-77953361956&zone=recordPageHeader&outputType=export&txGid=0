In different stages, the n-alkane homologues exhibited different distribution modes indicative of variations in the surrounding vegetation and the hydrologic condition of the lake. The n-alkanes proxies (CPIh, ACLh, Paq) have the same trends as the summer solar insolation variation, implying that the summer insolation is the most important climatic factor driving the environmental changes and also indirectly controls lake evolution on the Tibetan Plateau. CPIh and ACLh as well as the total pollen concentration appear to show a trend comparable with methane concentration record from the GRIP ice core that reflected the Dansgaard-Oeschger events. This demonstrates that the paleoclimate variations in Qarhan area generally agree with global climate change and show rapid oscillations in late MIS3. These findings provide the latest molecular fossil evidence from paleolake sediments to confirm that lake evolution on Tibetan Plateau in late MIS3 was closely associated with enhanced summer insolation. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","Molecular fossil; N-alkane; Paleoclimate; Paleoenvironment; Paleolake sediment; Solar insolation","Molecular fossils; n-Alkanes; Paleo-environment; Paleoclimates; Solar insolation; Biology; Climate change; Lakes; Methanation; Methane; Sedimentology; Sediments; Solar radiation; Paraffins; alkane; fossil record; insolation; lacustrine deposit; lake evolution; marine isotope stage; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; paleolimnology; China; Qaidam Basin; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,,,,,"Eglinton, T.I., Eglinton, G., Molecular proxies for paleoclimatology (2008) Earth Planet Sci Lett, 275, pp. 1-16; Xie, S.C., Yao, T.D., Kang, S.C., Climatic and environmental implications from organic matter in Dasuopu glacier in Xixiabangma in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (1999) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 42, pp. 383-391; Xie, S.C., Wang, Z.Y., Wang, H.M., The occurrence of a grassy vegetation over the Chinese Loess Plateau since the last interglacier: The molecular fossil record (2002) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 45, pp. 53-62; Zhang, H.C., Yang, M.S., Zhang, W.X., Molecular fossil and paleovegetation records of paleosol S4 and adjacent loess layers in the Luochuan loess section, NW China (2008) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 51, pp. 321-330; Xie, S.C., Yi, Y., Liu, Y.Y., The Pleistocene vermicular red earth in South China signaling the global climatic change: The molecular fossil record (2003) Sci China Ser D-Earth Sci, 46, pp. 1113-1120; Xie, S.C., Yi, Y., Huang, J.H., Lipid distribution in a subtropical southern China stalagmite as a record of soil ecosystem response to paleoclimate change (2003) Quat Res, 60, pp. 340-347; Blyth, A.J., Baker, A., Collins, M.J., Molecular organic matter in speleothems and its potential as an environmental proxy (2008) Quat Sci Rev, 27, pp. 905-921; Xie, S.C., Nott, C.J., Avsejs, L.A., Palaeoclimate records in compound- specific δD values of a lipid biomarker in ombrotrophic peat (2000) Org Geochem, 31, pp. 1053-1057; Zhou, W.J., Xie, S.C., Meyers, P.A., Reconstruction of late glacial and Holocene climate evolution in southern China from geolipids and pollen in the Dingnan peat sequence (2005) Org Geochem, 36, pp. 1272-1284; Xie, S.C., Pancost, R.D., Yin, H.F., Two episodes of microbial change coupled with Permo/Triassic faunal mass extinction (2005) Nature, 434, pp. 494-497; Huang, Q., Chen, K.Z., Palaeoclimatic fluctuation fashion of Qarhan salt lake in Qaidam Basin in the past 730000 years (in Chinese with English abstract) (1990) Quat Sci, 10, pp. 205-212; Shen, J., Wang, S., Liu, Y., The transgression record of the Gucheng Lake in 9.6 ka B.
