In a world with ongoing global warming, however, past data give a biased estimate of the actual present-day climate. Here we propose to correct this bias with a ""delta change"" method, in which model-simulated climate changes and observed global mean temperature changes are used to extrapolate past observations forward in time, to make them representative of present or future climate conditions. In a hindcast test for the years 1991-2002, the method works well for temperature, with a clear improvement in verification statistics compared to the case in which the hindcast is formed directly from the observations for 1961-1990. However, no improvement is found for precipitation, for which the signal-to-noise ratio between expected anthropogenic changes and interannual variability is much lower than for temperature. An application of the method to the present (around the year 2007) climate suggests that, as a geographical average over land areas excluding Antarctica, 8-9 months per year and 8-9 years per decade can be expected to be warmer than the median for 1971-2000. Along with the overall warming, a substantial increase in the frequency of warm extremes at the expense of cold extremes of monthly-to-annual temperature is expected. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Climate change; Climate normals; CMIP3; Present climate; Probability distribution","climate change; climate conditions; climate modeling; estimation method; global warming; hindcasting; signal-to-noise ratio; Antarctica",,,,,,"Boer, G.J., Yu, B., Climate sensitivity and climate state (2003) Clim Dyn, 21, pp. 167-176; Brier, G.W., Verification of forecasts expressed in terms of probability (1950) Mon Wea Rev, 78, pp. 1-3; Brohan, P., Kennedy, J.J., Harris, I., Tett, S.F.B., Jones, P.D., Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: A new dataset from 1850 (2006) J Geophys Res, 111, pp. D12106. , doi: 10.1029/2005JD006548; Candille, G., Talagrand, O., Evaluation of probabilistic prediction systems for a scalar variable (2005) Q J R Meteorol Soc, 131, pp. 2131-2150; Harvey, L.D.D., Characterizing the annual-mean climatic effect of anthropogenic CO2 and aerosol emissions in eight coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (2004) Clim Dyn, 23, pp. 569-599; Hegerl, G.C., Zwiers, F.W., Braconnot, P., Gillett, N.P., Luo, Y., Marengo Orsini, J.A., Nicholls, N., Stott, P.A., Understanding and attributing climate change (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, pp. 663-745. , In: Solomon S et al (eds) Cambridge University Press, London; Hersbach, H., Decomposition of the continuous ranked probability score for ensemble prediction systems (2000) Weather Forecast, 15, pp. 559-570; Huntingford, C., Cox, P.M., Analogue model to derive additional climate change scenarios from existing GCM simulations (2000) Clim Dyn, 16, pp. 575-586; Kjellström, E., Bärring, L., Jacob, D., Jones, R., Lenderink, G., Schär, C., Variability in daily maximum and minimum temperatures: Recent and future changes over Europe (2007) Clim Change, , doi: 10.1007/s10584-006-9220-5; Meehl, G.A., Covey, C., Delworth, T., Latif, M., McAvaney, B., Mitchell, J.F.B., Stouffer, R.J., Taylor, K.E., The WCRP CMIP3 multimodel dataset: A new era in climate change research (2007) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 88, pp. 1383-1394; Meehl, G.A., Stocker, T.F., Collins, W., Friedlingstein, P., Gaye, A., Gregory, J., Kitoh, A., Zhao, Z.-C., Global climate projections (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, pp. 747-845. , In: Solomon S et al (eds) Cambridge University Press, London; Mitchell, T.D., Pattern scaling: An examination of the accuracy of the technique for describing future climate (2003) Clim Change, 60, pp. 217-242; Mitchell, J.F.B., Johns, T.C., Eagles, M., Ingram, W.J., Davis, R.A., Towards the construction of climate change scenarios (1999) Clim Change, 41, pp. 547-581; Mitchell, T.D., Carter, T.R., Jones, P.D., Hulme, M., New, M., (2004) A Comprehensive Set of High-resolution Grids of Monthly Climate for Europe and the Globe: The Observed Record (1901-2000) and 16 Scenarios (2001-2100), p. 30. , Tyndall Centre Working Paper 55; Nakićenović, N., Alcamo, J., Davis, G., de Vries, B., Fenhann, J., Gaffin, S., Gregory, K., Dadi, Z., (2000) Emission Scenarios, p. 599. , A special report of Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
