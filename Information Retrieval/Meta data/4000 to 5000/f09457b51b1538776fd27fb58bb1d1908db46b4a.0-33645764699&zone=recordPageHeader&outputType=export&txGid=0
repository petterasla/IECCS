Lower molecular weight commercial PFPE fractions have boiling points ranging between 55 and 270 °C, and have the potential to escape into the atmosphere. To improve our understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of PFPEs, a distilled fraction of a commercial mixture containing perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ethers (PFPMIEs) was introduced into an atmospheric chamber system. Relative rate techniques were used to determine upper limits for the rate constants for reactions of OH and Cl with PFPMIE in 700 Torr of air at 296 K. The reactivity of PFPMIE with Cl was less than 2 × 10-17 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, while the reactivity with OH was less than 6.8 × 10-16 cm 3 molecule-1 s-1, indicating low reactivity in the troposphere. Consequently, the lifetime of PFPMIE should be limited by transport to the mesosphere, where photolysis by Lyman-α radiation at 121.6 nm will be efficient. By analogy to perfluorinated alkanes, the lower limit for the total atmospheric lifetime is 800 years. PFPMIE was shown to have instantaneous radiative forcing of 0.65 W m-2 ppb-1, which corresponds to a global warming potential on a 100 year time scale of 9000 relative to CO2 and 1.95 relative to CFC-11. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Distillation; Global warming; Mixtures; Molecular weight; Polyethers; Rate constants; Reaction kinetics; Troposphere; Atmospheric lifetime; Boiling point; Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE); Perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ethers (PFPMIE); Fluorine containing polymers; alkane; ether derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ether; unclassified drug; Distillation; Fluorine containing polymers; Global warming; Mixtures; Molecular weight; Polyethers; Rate constants; Reaction kinetics; Troposphere; atmospheric convection; ether; fluid dynamics; fluorine; global warming; reaction kinetics; alpha radiation; article; atmospheric deposition; chemical structure; distillation; force; greenhouse effect; infrared spectroscopy; photolysis; reaction analysis; reaction time; troposphere; Atmosphere; Ethers; Fluorocarbons; Heat; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Photochemistry; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared",,"Ethers; Fluorocarbons; perfluoropolyether",,,,"Christensen, L.K., Sehested, J., Nielsen, O.J., Bilde, M., Wallington, T.J., Gushin, A., Molina, L.T., Molina, M.J., Atmospheric chemistry of HFE-7200 (C4F9OC 2H5): Reaction with OH radicals and fate of C 4F9OCH2CH2O and C4F 9OCHOCH3 radicals (1998) J.
