In this paper the issues of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector in Italy are addressed. A comparative static approach is applied for the years 1980 and 1995. A decomposition scheme is proposed in order to highlight the main factors determining the variation of carbon dioxide emissions over the period.

Results indicate that the main driving force of the variation of carbon dioxide emissions in Italy is the growth in GDP. Total global warming damage caused by the transport sector in Italy ranges from 0.02 to 0.1% of GDP.Total carbon dioxide emissions from the Italian transportation sector are estimated for the 1980-95 period. The social cost incurred by these emissions is also analyzed, revealing that growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is the main driving force for CO2 emissions. A total social cost for Italy ranges from 0.02%, in the lower damage scenario, to 0.1%, in the upper damage scenario, of 1995 GDP values. Opportunities for curbing emissions in this sector as well as in the entire economy are summarized.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Global warming; Transport","Gross domestic product (GDP); Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Energy policy; carbon emission; climate change; economic analysis; greenhouse effect; transportation economics; Italy",,,,,,"Ayres, R., Walter, J., The greenhouse effect: Damages, costs and abatement (1991) Environmental and Resource Economics, 1, pp. 237-270; Cline, W.R., Scientific basis for the greenhouse effect (1991) The Economic Journal, 101 (407), pp. 909-919; Cline, W.R., (1992) Optimal Carbon Emissions Over Time: Experiments with the Nordhaus DICE Model, , Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC; Cline, W.R., (1993) Modelling Economically Efficient Abatement of Greenhouse Gases, , Presented the United Nation University Conference on Global Environment, Energy and Economic Development, Tokyo, September 1993; Danielis, R., Energy use for transport in Italy: Past trends (1995) Energy Policy, 23 (9), pp. 799-807; Danielis, R., Consumo di energia ed emissioni di CO2 nei trasporti in Italia (1996), 39 (1). , Economia delle, Fonti di Energia e dell'Ambiente anno(1993) Transport Policy and Global Warming, , Paris; (1995) ExternE: Externalities of Energy.
