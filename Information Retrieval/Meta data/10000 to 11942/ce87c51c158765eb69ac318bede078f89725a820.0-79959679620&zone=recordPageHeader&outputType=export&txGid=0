These efforts have conserved threatened landscapes, protected biodiversity and engaged civil society in land-use planning and management. However, the conservation of satoyama continues to present a paradox familiar to landscape planners and ecologists: how can we conserve, but avoid freezing, landscapes of dynamic change? This article works through this paradox by examining the dynamic and continually evolving history of satoyama woodlands. The history of satoyama presented here demonstrates that these landscapes have been, and continue to be, produced in tandem with the evolving needs of successive generations. Accordingly, it is imperative to consider how satoyama landscapes might mesh with present day social needs and values. Faced with curbing global climate change, we suggest that present day social needs and values are well aligned with utilizing satoyama woodlands as a source of renewable biomass energy to reduce carbon emissions and realize associated multifunctional woodland values. Thus, the conceptual perspective advanced here is that resolution of the continuing conservation paradox lies in taking the freeze off satoyama woodlands-and by extension other vernacular landscapes-and thereby letting them live. © 2010 International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer.","Continuing landscape; Cultural landscape; Woody biomass; Working woodlands",,,,,,,"(2008) Kashiwa-Shi Chikyuu Ondan-Ka Taisaku Keikaku, , City of Kashiwa(in Japanese), Kashiwa: Kashiwa-shi kankyou-bu kankyou hozen-ka; (1999) Regeneration around Cities: The Role of England's Community Forests, , Countryside Agency, Cheltenham: Countryside Agency; Fukamachi, K., Oku, H., Nakashizuka, T., The change of a satoyama landscape and its causality in Kamiseya, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan between 1970 and 1995 (2001) Landsc Ecol, 16, pp. 703-717; Imamori, M., (1995) Satoyama: In harmony with neighboring nature, , Tokyo, Shincho-Sha (in Japanese); Kobori, H., Primack, R.B., Participatory conservation approaches for satoyama, the traditional forest and agricultural landscape of Japan (2003) AMBIO J Hum Environ, 32, pp. 307-311; Mather, A.S., Forests of consumption: postproductivism, postmaterialism, and the postindustrial forest (2001) Environ Plan C Gov Policy, 19, pp. 249-268; (2008) The Third National Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity, , Ministry of the Environment(in Japanese), Tokyo: Ministry of the Environment; (2008) Comprehensive Planning for Achieving the Goals of Kyoto Protocol, , Ministry of the Environment(in Japanese), Tokyo: Ministry of the Environment; Mizushima, T., Kaga, H., Shimomura, Y., Masuda, N., A study about community conservation of natural environment activity view from corporate social responsibility (2008) J Jpn Inst Landsc Archit, 71, pp. 705-708. , (in Japanese with English abstract); Nakagawa, S., Coppice wood as an energy source (2003) Satoyama: The traditional rural landscape of Japan, pp. 158-171. , In: Takeuchi K, Brown RD, Washitani I, Tsunekawa A, Yokohari M (eds), Springer, Tokyo; Nakagawa, S., (2004) Mori-Zukuri Tekisubukku, , (in Japanese), Tokyo: Yama to Keikokusha; Pannell, S., (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons from the World Heritage List, , Cairns: Rainforest CRC James Cook University; Rackham, O., (1980) Ancient Woodland, , London: Edward Arnold; Shidei, T., (2006) Shinrin Ha Mori Ya Hayashi Dewa Nai, , (in Japanese), Kyoto: Nakanishiya; Takeuchi, K., Satoyama landscapes as managed nature (2003) Satoyama: The traditional rural landscape of Japan, pp. 9-16. , In: Takeuchi K, Brown RD, Washitani I, Tsunekawa A, Yokohari M (eds), Springer, Tokyo; Takeuchi, K., Brown, R.D., Washitani, I., Tsunekawa, A., Yokohari, M., (2003) Satoyama: The traditional rural landscape of Japan, , Springer, Tokyo; Tamura, S., (1998) Mura Kara Mita Satoyama No Shizen to Hitobito No Kurashi, , (in Japanese), Saitama: Ogawa-machi; Terada, T., Yokohari, M., Tanaka, N., Estimates of CO2 fixation and reduction based on various maintenance scenarios and woody biomass utilization in a suburban area (2009) J Jpn Inst Landsc Archit, 723-726. , in Japanese with English abstract; Tsunekawa, A., Transition of satoyama landscapes in Japan (2003) Satoyama: The traditional rural landscape of Japan, pp. 41-51. , Takeuchi, K, Brown, RD, Washitani, I, Tsunekawa, A, Yokohari, M (eds), Springer, Tokyo; Tsunekawa, A., Strategic management of satoyama landscapes (2003) Satoyama: The traditional rural landscape of Japan, pp. 179-191. , Takeuchi, K, Brown, RD, Washitani, I, Tsunekawa, A, Yokohari, M (eds), Springer, Tokyo; (2008) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention, , UNESCO, Paris: UNESCO World Heritage Centre; Yf, S., (2002) South Yorkshire Forest Plan 2002, , Sheffield: South Yorkshire Forest Partnership; Yokohari, M., Kurita, H., Mechanisms of satoyama landscape transformation (2003) Satoyama: The traditional rural landscape of Japan, pp. 71-79. , Takeuchi, K, Brown, RD, Washitani, I, Tsunekawa, A, Yokohari, M (eds), Springer, Tokyo; Yokohari, M., Terada, T., Tanaka, N., Restoring the maintenance of satoyamas by utilizing harvested organic materials as a biomass resource (2006) Patterns and processes in forest landscapes: Consequences of human management, pp. 327-332. , Accademia Italiana di Scienze Forestali, Firenze","Yokohari, M.; Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 5-1-5 Kashiwa-no-ha, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8563, Japan; email: myoko@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp",,,,,,,,18601871,,,,"English","Landsc.
