The data used in the study were obtained from 98 local tomato growers using a questionnaire. The farms were chosen by random sampling method. The results showed that the amount of energy consumed in stake-tomato production was 96 957.36 MJ ha -1. About 42% of this was generated by diesel oil and 38% from fertilizers and machinery. The input-output ratio was 0.80 and energy productivity was found to be 1.00 kg MJ ha -1. About 76% of the total energy inputs used in stake-tomato production was non-renewable while only about 22% was renewable. These findings reveal that intensive input use in stake-tomato production, especially chemical fertilizers, gives a high tomato yield but also raises some problems like environmental pollution and global warming. Thus, new policies, emphasizing energy consumption without degradation of national resources, should be designed for such farms. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
