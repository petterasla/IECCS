In particular, forests have been identified as a significant carbon sink that can mitigate the rate of global climate change. Policy makers are faced with complex and difficult challenges in getting timely and useful information in monitoring global forest resources. Recent advances in the tools and methods of forest carbon accounting have produced new, innovative approaches to forest-based carbon inventories. But it is important as new tools are developed that scientists understand the needs of policy makers and that policy makers understand the capabilities and limitations of forest inventory methods. This paper explores four different policy applications that rely, or could benefit from, national carbon inventories. The goal is to help build a bridge between the communities of climate policy makers and scientists specialized in forest carbon inventories. To this end, we pursue three specific objectives: First we provide an overview for policy makers about approaches to forest carbon inventories, paying particular attention to the contributions of remote sensing technologies. Second, we outline the issues particularly relevant to forest inventory scientists who are interested in responding to public policy needs. We then discuss the tradeoffs between information cost, accuracy, precision, transparency and timeliness that need to be balanced in long-term monitoring of forest carbon. Finally, the article concludes with a series of observations and recommendations for the implementation of forest carbon inventories as increasingly central components of global climate change policy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Forestry; Remote sensing; Carbon accountings; Carbon inventories; Carbon sinks; Central components; Climate policies; Forest inventories; Forest resources; Global carbon cycles; Global climate changes; Information costs; Innovative approaches; Land covers; Long-term monitoring; National forests; New tools; Policy makers; Remote sensing technologies; Tools and methods; Climate change; carbon; carbon cycle; climate change; environmental assessment; environmental policy; forest inventory; land cover; policy analysis; policy making; Carbon; Climates; Costs; Forestry; Information Retrieval; Inventories; Monitoring; Remote Sensing; Resources",,,,,,"Achard, F., Eva, H., Mayaux, P., Tropical forest mapping from coarse spatial resolution satellite data: Production and accuracy assessment issues (2001) Int J Remote Sens, 22, pp. 2741-2762; Andersson, K., Richards, K., Implementing an international carbon sequestration program: Can the leaky sink be fixed?
