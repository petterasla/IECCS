The conclusion is consistent with the power systems data in 2008 with ice storm present. Since power systems cover large areas, climate is the key factor to its safety and stability. In-depth analysis shows that the SOC of atmosphere system contributes much to that of power system faults. Extreme climate will be more intense and frequent with global warming, it will have more and more impact upon power systems. The SOC feature of power system faults is utilized to develop approaches to facilitate power systems adaptation to climate variation in an economical and efficient way. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Extreme climate; Global warming; Power systems; Self-organized criticality",,,,,,,"Prigogine, I., Nicolis, G., (1977) Self-Organization in Nonequilibrium Systems: From Dissipative Structures to Order Through Fluctuations, , John Wiley&Sons New York; Bak, P., Tang, C., Wiesenfeld, K., Self-organized criticality: An explanation of 1/f noise (1988) Phys Rev Lett, 59, pp. 381-384; Liu, C., (1988) Dissipative Structure Theory of Atmosphere System (In Chinese), , Press of Meteorology Beijing; Rind, D., Complexity and climate (1999) Science, 284, pp. 105-107; Peters, O., Christensen, K., Rain: Relaxations in the sky (2002) Phys Rev e, 66, p. 036120; Aegerter, C.M., A sandpile model for the distribution of rainfall (2003) Phys A, 319 (1), pp. 1-10; Peters, O., Hertlein, C., Christensen, K., A complexity view of rainfall (2001) Phys Rev Lett, 88, p. 018701; Bove, R., Pelino, V., De Leonibus, L., Complexity in rainfall phenomena (2006) Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simulat, 11 (6), pp. 678-684; Saunders, M.A., Lea, A.S., Seasonal prediction of hurricane activity reaching the coast of the United States (2005) Nature, 434, pp. 1005-1008; Amin, M., Energy infrastructure defense Systems (2005) Proc IEEE, 93 (5), pp. 861-875; Bunde, A., Eichner, J.F., Kantelhardt, J.W., Long-term memory: A natural mechanism for the clustering of extreme events and anomalous residual times in climate records (2005) Phys Rev Lett, 94, p. 048701; Turcottea, D.L., Malamud, B.D., Landslides, forest, and earthquakes: Examples of self-organized critical behavior (2004) Phys A, 340 (4), pp. 580-589; Acharya, J.R., Weather effect considerations in reliability evaluation of electrical transmission and distribution systems (2005) Master Thesis, , University of Saskatchewan Saskatoon; Billinton, R., Acharya, J.R., Weather-based distribution system reliability evaluation (2006) IEE Proc Gene Trans & Distri, 153 (5), pp. 499-506; IEEE Guide for Electric Power Distribution Reliability Indices, , IEEE Std 1366 2003; Su, S., Duan, X., Chan, W.L., Probability distribution of fault in distribution systems (2008) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 23 (3), pp. 1521-1522; Hurst, H.E., Long-term storage capacity of reservoirs (1951) Trans Amer Soc Civil Eng, 116, pp. 770-808; Pin, E.D., Carniel, R., Tarraga, M., Event recognition by detrended fluctuation analysis: An application to Teide-Pico Viejo volcanic complex, Tenerife, Spain (2008) Chaos Soliton Fract, 36 (5), pp. 1173-1180; Zhang, Y., Chen, F., Statistical analysis on fault in Changsha Distribution Systems (in Chinese) (2007) Electric Power, 40 (5), pp. 28-31; Carreras, B.A., Newman, D.E., Dobson, I., Evidence for self-organized criticality in a time series of electric power system blackouts (2004) IEEE Trans Circ Syst i, 51 (9), pp. 1733-1740; Bakke, H.Ø.J., Hansen, A., Kertesz, J., Failures and avalanches in complex networks (2006) Europhys Lett, 76 (4), pp. 717-723; Mei, S., Xue, A., Zhang, X., On power system blackout modeling and analysis based on self-organized criticality (2008) Sci China ser E-Tech Sci, 51 (2), pp. 209-219; Albert, R., Albert, I., Nakarado, G.L., Structural vulnerability of the North American power grid (2004) Phys Rev e, 69 (2), p. 025103; Bernstein, L., Bosch, P., Canziani, O., (2007) Climate Change in 2007: Synthesis Report, , Technical Report, International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Milly, P.C.D., Wetherald, R.T., Dunne, K.A., Increasing risk of great floods in a changing climate (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 514-517; Overbye, T., Dobson, I., Jewell, W., (2007) The Electric Power Industry and Climate Change: Power Systems Research Possibilities, , Technical Report, Power systems engineering research center of the United States of America; (2006) Climate Change Impacts and the Electric Sector.
