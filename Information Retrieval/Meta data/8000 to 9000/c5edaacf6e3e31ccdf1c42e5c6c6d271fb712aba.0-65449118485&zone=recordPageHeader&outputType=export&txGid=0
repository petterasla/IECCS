Both the theoretic analysis and Monte Carlo simulation results show that the most likely probability of its occurrence intensity of the k'th record-breaking high temperature events takes the form of linear increase with k√(k =1, 2, 3, ⋯), and the frequency of the occurrence of record-breaking high temperature events in a year tends to 1/(t+1), decreasing with time t, and in years when the average temperature is high, the probability of the occurrence of record-breaking high temperature events is also high, otherwise, the probability is low. The result also indicates that the velocity of global warming (v=0.006°C/a) in 20th century and the rate of regional warming (v=0.017°C/a) of Nanjing area in last 40 years are yet insufficient to alter meaningfully the intensity and frequency of record high temperature events. However, such velocity of warming will ultimately make the frequency of the occurrence of record-breaking high temperature events decrease gradually towards a constant, being approximately equal to the warming velocities. In addition, we have also studied the effect of variances and autocorrelation between temperatures in two successive days on record-breaking high temperature events, finding that the effect of different variance and weak autocorrelation on the intensity and probability of occurrence of the record-breaking high temperature events in a year can be neglected. © 2009 Chin.
