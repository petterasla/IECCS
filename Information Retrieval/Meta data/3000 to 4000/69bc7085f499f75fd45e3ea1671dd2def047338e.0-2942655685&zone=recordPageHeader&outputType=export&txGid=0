Results show that CO2 capture efficiencies are very high, while there is a sufficient fraction of CaO in the bed reacting in the fast reaction regime. The total capture capacity of the bed decays with the number of carbonation- calcination cycles. The experimental CO2 concentration profiles measured inside the bed during the fast reaction period are interpreted with the KL fluid bed model, by supplying information on sorbent deactivation from laboratory tests. It is concluded that a fluidized bed of CaO can be a suitable reactor to achieve very effective CO2 capture efficiencies from a combustion flue gas. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Carbonation; CO2 capture; Fluidized beds; Global warming; Modeling","Calcination; Calcium compounds; Combustion; Flue gases; Fluidized beds; Mathematical models; Capture efficiencies; Carbonation reaction; Fluid bed models; Sorbent deactivation; Gas dynamics; calcium oxide; carbon dioxide; sorbent; carbon dioxide; carbonation; combustion; fluidized bed; article; calcium transport; chemical reaction kinetics; combustion; flue gas; fluidized bed; fluidized bed reactor; gas analysis; high temperature procedures; kl fluid bed model; laboratory test; mathematical analysis; process model; reaction analysis; reaction optimization",,"calcium oxide, 1305-78-8; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Abanades, J.C., The maximum capture efficiency of CO2 using a carbonation/calcination cycle of CaO/CaCO3 (2002) Chem.
