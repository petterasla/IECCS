The target H2 pathways are the H2 pathway of water electrolysis (WE) with wind power (WE[Wind]) and the H2 pathway of WE by Korean electricity mix (WE[KEM]). Conventional fuels (gasoline and diesel) are also included as target fuel pathways to identify the fuel pathways with economic and environmental advantages over conventional fuels. The key environmental issues in the transportation sector are analyzed in terms of fossil fuel consumption (FFC), regulated air pollutants (RAPs), abiotic resource depletion (ARD), and global warming (GW). The life cycle costs of the target fuel pathways consist of the well-to-tank (WTT) costs and the tank-to-wheel (TTW) costs. Moreover, two scenarios are analyzed to predict potential economic and environmental improvements offered by wind energy-powered hydrogen stations. In LCA results, WE[Wind] is superior to the other pathways in all environmental categories. The LCC results show that the projected WTT cost savings of WE[Wind] and WE[KEM] compared to gasoline are US $ 0.050 and US $ 0.036 per MJ, respectively, because hydrogen will not be subjected to any fuel tax according to the Korean Energy Policy in 2015. Although WE[KEM] and WE[Wind] incur high capital costs owing to the required capital investment in fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), they have lower well-to-wheel (WTW) costs than those of conventional fuels due to the high FCV efficiency in fuel utilization stage. WTW costs for gasoline are higher than those of WE[KEM] and WE[Wind] by US $ 12,600 and US $ 10,200, respectively. This study demonstrated the future competitiveness of the WE[Wind] pathway in both environmental and economic aspects. In the WTT stage, the point-of-sale of the electricity produced by the wind power plant (WPP) cannot be controlled because the wind-powered electricity production fluctuates considerably depending on the wind. However, the use of a wind-powered H2 station in the future enables stable wind power plant management and provides greater economic profit than the present system since the wind-powered electricity can be used for the hydrogen production in the H2 station and any residual electricity is sold to Korea electric power corporation (KEPCO). If 5% of conventional vehicles in Korea are substituted with FCVs using H2 via WE[Wind] in 2015, CO2 emission will be reduced by 2,876,000 tons/year and annual LCC costs by US $ 8559 million. Thus, the operation of wind-powered hydrogen stations will encourage the introduction of hydrogen into the transportation fuel market. © 2009.","Hydrogen; LCA (life cycle assessment); LCC (life cycle costing); Wind energy","Air pollutants; Capital costs; Capital investment; Conventional fuel; Cost saving; Economic aspects; Economic profit; Electric power corporation; Electricity production; Environmental improvements; Environmental issues; Fuel cell vehicles; Fuel tax; Fuel utilization; Hydrogen station; Life cycle costing; Life-cycle assessments; Lifecycle costs; Resource depletion; Transportation fuels; Transportation sector; Using life; Water electrolysis; Well-to-wheel; Wind energy; Wind-hydrogen system; Air pollution; Competition; Cost reduction; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gasoline; Global warming; Hydrogen production; Investments; Life cycle; Oxygen; Plant management; Profitability; Reactive power; Tanks (containers); Targets; Wheels; Wind power",,,,,,"(2006) The annual statistics of greenhouse gases in Korea, , Korea Energy Management Corporation, in Korean; (2006) New & Renewable energy policy and R&D status, , Korea energy management corporation, in Korean; The status of new & renewable energy policy and R&D, Korea: Korea energy management corporation; 2006 [in Korean]Joan, O., (2005) The transition to hydrogen, , Access No 27: 10-16; International Organization for Standardization (ISO), (2004) ISO 14040: environmental management - life cycle assessment - principles and framework: Switzerland; International Organization for Standardization (ISO), (2006) ISO 14044: environmental management - life cycle assessment - requirement and guidelines: Switzerland; Guinee, J.B., Bruijn, H.D., Duin, R.V., (2001) Life cycle assessment - an operational guide to the ISO standards: CML; Fuller, S.K., Petersen, S.R., (1996) Life-cycle costing manual for the Federal energy management program, LCC manual: US.DOE; The status of the wind power plant at Hangwon Ri in Jeju island, Korea: Jeju special self-Govering province; 2006 [in Korean]Sim, Y.S., (2006) The status of electricity generation by wind power plant at Hangyung-Ri in Jeju island, , Southern Power Co., Ltd., Korea [in Korean]; Hunkeler, D., Lichtenvort, K., Rebitzer, G., (2008) Environmental life cycle costing, , SETAC; (2005) Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy, , Master plan for the Environmental friendly Hydrogen economy:, in Korean; Robert, R., William, V., (2004) Fuel Cell Vehicle World Survey 2003, , Breakthrough Technologies Institute; Jonathan, X.W., Lipman, T.E., (2006) An Assessment of the Near-Term Costs of Hydrogen Refueling Stations and Station Components, , U.C DAVIS;; Weinert, J.A., (2005) Near-term economic analysis of hydrogen fueling stations, , U.C DAVIS;; (2003) The Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy, , Environmental national standard database:, in Korean; Spath, P.L., Mann, M.K., (2004) Life cycle assessment of renewable hydrogen production via wind/electrolysis, , National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Dongquan, H., Anthony, F., (2001) Well-to-tank energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of transportation fuels-North American analysis: GM, , Argonne National Lab;; (2002) Life cycle inventory of products - water, industrial water, raw materials and chemical components: domestic area, , The Korean Ministry of Environment (Ministry of Environment) [in Korean]; The status of Indonesian energy industry, Korea.
