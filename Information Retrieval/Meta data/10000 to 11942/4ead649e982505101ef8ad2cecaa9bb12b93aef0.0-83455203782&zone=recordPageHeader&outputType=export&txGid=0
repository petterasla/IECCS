The original FFVA design used a connecting rod in order to transform the rotating motion of the actuator to translating motion of the valve. In the improved design introduced here, the connecting rod is replaced by a flexible linkage. This step is taken in order to eliminate wear and play in the mechanical connections. A detailed design procedure is presented to optimize the heavy fatigue load on this element. Simulations and experimental tests are carried out in order to validate the system performance. It is shown that valve trajectory and energy consumption of the actuation system obtained by simulations are consistent with those observed experimentally. The present redesigned FFVA system then provides more reliable valve motion than previously shown designs. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","flexible linkage design; flexible valve actuation system; intake valve; internal combustion engine","Actuation systems; Detailed design; Electro-mechanical valve; Experimental test; Fatigue loads; Flexible linkages; Mechanical connections; Mechanical design; Naturally aspirated; Rotating motion; Valve actuation; Valve motion; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Connecting rods; Design; Energy utilization; Intake valves; Internal combustion engines; Optimization; Valves (mechanical)",,,,,,"Pischger, M., Salber, W., Staay, F.V.D., Baumgarten, H., Kemper, H., Low fuel consumption and low emissions-electromechanical valvetrain in vehicle operation (2000) Int.
