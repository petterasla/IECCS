Losses are increasing dramatically, mainly because of population and capital moving into harm's way and also because of human-driven transformations of hydrological systems, including river basins and floodplains.","Context; Europe; Flood policy; Risk; Urbanization; Vulnerability","Floods; Global warming; Hydrology; River basin projects; Human-driven transformations; Risk assessment; river water; runoff; anthropogenic effect; flood; global warming; natural hazard; vulnerability; anxiety; climate; deforestation; disaster; ecology; economic aspect; Europe; flooding; global climate; greenhouse effect; hydrology; land use; review; risk assessment; river; tourism; Europe",,,,,,"Rotmans, J., Hulme, M., Tdowning, T.E., Climate change implications for Europe: An application of the ESCAPE model (1994) Global Environmental Change, 4 (2), pp. 97-124; Meyer, W., Turner, I., (1994) Changes in Land Use and Land Cover: A Global Perspective, , Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press; Bronstert, A., River flooding in Germany: Influenced by climate change?
