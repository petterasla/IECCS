While there are presently no discernible changes in tropical cyclone characteristics that could reasonably be ascribed to global warming, predictions suggest some increases in tropical cyclone maximum intensity in a warmer world. Formation regions are unlikely to change, while little consensus has emerged regarding changes in cyclone numbers or tracks. Some uncertainty in these predictions is created by clear deficiencies in current climate models. If predictions of intensities are correct, however, changes should be detectable in the Atlantic some time after 2050. © Inter-Research 2004.","Climate change; Global warming; Tropical cyclones","climate change; global warming; recurrence interval; storm track; tropical cyclone",,,,,,"Basher, R.E., Zheng, X., Tropical cyclones in the southwest Pacific: Spatial patterns and relationships to Southern Oscillation and sea surface temperature (1995) J Clim, 8, pp. 1249-1260; Bengtsson, L., Botzet, M., Esch, M., Will greenhouse gas induced warming over the next 50 years lead to higher frequency and greater intensity of hurricanes?
