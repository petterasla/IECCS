Production of ethanol (bioethanol) from biomass is one way to reduce both the consumption of crude oil and environmental pollution. Using bioethanol-blended fuel for automobiles can significantly reduce petroleum use and exhaust greenhouse gas emission. While more expensive to produce than other fuel types, bioethanol production boosts the farm economy. Up to 80% of production cost is the cost of feedstock. Bioethanol can be produced from cellulose feedstocks such as corn stalks, rice straw, sugar cane bagasse, pulpwood, switchgrass, and municipal solid waste.","Bioconversion; Bioethanol; Economics; Environmental impact; Lignocellulosic feedstock","Bio-ethanol production; Blended fuels; CO2 emissions; Corn stalk; Critical review; Crude oil; Environmental pollutions; Farm economy; Fuel types; Lignocellulosic feedstock; Municipal Solid Waste; Production cost; Renewable energy source; Rice straws; Sugar-cane bagasse; Switchgrass; Vehicular fuel; Biomass; Crude petroleum; Economics; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Solid wastes; Sugar (sucrose); Sugar cane; Sugars; Bioethanol; Biomass; Crude Oil; Economics; Ethanol; Fossil Fuels; Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Leakage; Lignocellulose; Solid Wastes; Sugar",,,,,,"Asher, A., Opportunities in biofuels creating competitive biofuels markets (2006) Biofuels Australasia 2006 Conference, , Sydney, Australia, November 20-22; Avellar, B.K., Glasser, W.G., Steam-assisted biomass fractionation.
