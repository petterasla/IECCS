The coated droplets are called globules. Depending on the globule diameter and the CaCO3 sheath thickness, the globules sink to the bottom of the water column, are neutrally buoyant, or float on top of the water. The CaCO3 particles are lodged at the CO2/ H2O interface, preventing the coalescence of the CO2 droplets, and thus stabilizing the CO2-in-water emulsion. We describe the expected behavior of a CO2/H2O/CaCO3 emulsion plume released in the deep ocean for sequestration of CO2 in the ocean to ameliorate global warming. Depending on the amount of CO2 injected, the dense plume will descend a few hundred meters while entraining ambient seawater until it acquires neutral buoyancy in the stratified ocean. After equilibration, the globules will rain out from the plume toward the ocean bottom. This mode of CO2 release will prevent acidification of the seawater around the release point, which is a major environmental drawback of ocean sequestration of liquid, unemulsified CO2.",,"Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactors; Global warming; Limestone; Seawater; Supercritical fluids; Macroemulsions; Ocean sequestration; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Emulsions; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; limestone; sea water; water; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; environmental disturbance; marine environment; article; dispersion; emulsion; greenhouse effect; hyperbarism; plume; reactor; sea; thickness; Calcium Carbonate; Carbon Dioxide; Emulsions; Greenhouse Effect; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Seawater",,"calcium carbonate, 13397-26-7, 13701-58-1, 14791-73-2, 471-34-1; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; limestone, 1317-65-3; water, 7732-18-5; Calcium Carbonate, 471-34-1; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Emulsions",,,,"Golomb, D., Angelopoulos, A., A benign form of CO2 sequestration in the ocean (2001) Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies, pp. 463-467. , Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies; CSIRO Publishing: Collingwood, Victoria, Australia; Ramsden, W., Separation of solids in the surface layers of solutions and suspensions - Preliminary account (1903) Proc.
