The seasonal runoff and soil moisture for the Mesochora catchment in Central Greece were simulated using two hydrological models that were different in structure and time resolution. Variability was investigated via a monthly water balance (MWB) model which has a first-order memory and includes a rough estimation of snowmelt component, and via the coupling of the snow accumulation-ablation (SAA) conceptual model and the soil moisture accounting(SMA) conceptual model of the US National Weather Service (US NWS). The last two models operated at a 6 h and daily time step, respectively. The SMA model predicted greater interannual variability of runoff changes than did the MWB model, for all alternative climates. However, greater runoff increases in winter (by month and season) and greater decreases in summer (by month and season) were predicted by the MWB model. During the spring and autumn months the results were much more complicated. The variability of runoff changes with respect to temperature increase showed that the MWB model is less sensitive to large temperature increase than the SAA-SMA models for all precipitation climates. Whereas the SMA model soil moisture varied substantially for the alternative climates and a particular month (and season), the MWB model soil moisture remained unaffected by any climate during winter. The soil moisture reduction predicted flora the MWB model was greater than that predicted from the SMA model in late spring and summer. There was a slight reduction in the SMA model soil moisture with respect to temperature increase in winter, for all precipitation climates. During winter and August the MWB model soil moisture remained unaffected by any temperature increase, whereas during the other months the soil moisture reduction varied proportionally with respect to temperature increase for both models (SMA and MWB) and all precipitation climates.",,"Monthly water balance (MWB) model; Snow accumulation ablation (SAA) model; Soil moisture accounting (SMA) model; Climate change; Mathematical models; Moisture determination; Runoff; Snow; Soils; Thermal effects; Hydrology; catchments; climate; runoff; soils; climate change; global change; model; modelling; runoff; snow accumulation/ablation; soil moisture; variation; water balance; Greece, Mesochora Basin",,,,,,"Anderson, E.A., National Weather Service river forecast system.
