The estimated GST drop due to fine dust from the actual atmospheric nuclear explosions based on the published simulation results by other researchers (a single column model and Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model) has served to explain the stagnation in global warming. Atmospheric nuclear explosions can be regarded as full-scale in situ tests for nuclear winter. The non-negligible amount of GST drop from the actual atmospheric explosions suggests that nuclear winter is not just a theory but has actually occurred, albeit on a small scale. The accuracy of the simulations of GST by IPCC would also be improved significantly by introducing the influence of fine dust from the actual atmospheric nuclear explosions into their climate models; thus, global warming behavior could be more accurately predicted. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric nuclear explosions; Global warming; Global-mean surface temperature","20th century; Atmosphere ocean general circulation models; Global-mean surface temperature; In-situ test; Simulation result; Single-column model; Small scale; Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Computer simulation; Drops; Dust; Global warming; Nuclear explosions; Surface properties; Explosives",,,,,,"Andronova, N.G., Schlesinger, M.E., Causes of global temperature changes during the 19th and 20th centuries (2000) Geophys.
