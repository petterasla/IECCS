By investigating the behavior of correlation coefficients between the annual rainfall amounts and the within-the-year cumulative frequency distribution functions of wet days with various threshold rainfall depths, it was found that (1) the annual rainfall amount is weakly correlated with the number of either dry or wet days - thus, the zero rainfall depth is not a proper threshold for the explanation of dry or wet years; and (2) there exist certain thresholds of daily rainfall depth (the climatological thresholds) with which the cumulative frequency of wet days can be well related with the annual rainfall amount. Also with this threshold, the wet and dry years can be seen divided clearly into separate groups of the cumulative frequency distribution functions without any overlaps, which were common when using the zero rainfall depth as a threshold. Because it is found that there exist certain thresholds to be used for explaining the annual rainfall amount changes, these might also be used effectively for the analysis of possible changes in flood or drought patterns caused by global warming.",,"Climatology; Correlation methods; Data reduction; Drought; Floods; Global warming; Rain; Rainfall depth; Hydrology; correlation; data processing; frequency analysis; rainfall; Korea",,,,,,"Frederick, K.D., Rosenberg, N.J., (1994) Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Natural Resource Systems, , Kluwer Academic, Boston; Chen, Z.Q., Kavvas, M.L., Tan, L., Soong, S.-T., Development of a regional atmospheric-hydrologic model for the study of climate change in California (1996) Proc., ASCE North American Water and Environment Congr, pp. 1093-1098. , ASCE, New York; Oh, J.-H., Climate Change due to CO2 increase: Prediction of precipitation change in Korea (1993) Proc., Symp. on Effect of Climate Change on Korea, pp. 37-112. , Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea (in Korean); Oh, J.-H., Hong, S.G., Precipitation change in Korea due to atmospheric CO2 increase (1995) J.
