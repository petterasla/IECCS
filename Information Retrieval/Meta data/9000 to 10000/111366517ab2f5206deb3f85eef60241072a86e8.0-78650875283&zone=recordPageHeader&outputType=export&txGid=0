Using an energy balance model that diffuses moist static energy, it is shown that: (1) the increase in atmospheric moisture content causes most of the increase in transport, and (2) changes in the radiation budget due to clouds explain most of the spread among GCMs. This work also shows that biases in clouds, surface albedo, ocean heat uptake, and aerosols will not only affect climate locally but will also influence other latitudes through energy transport. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"Atmospheric aerosols; Climate models; Clouds; Global warming; Atmospheric moisture content; Energy balance models; Energy transport; Global climate model; Moist static energy; Ocean heat uptake; Poleward energy transport; Radiation budget; Surface albedo; Atmospheric movements; aerosol; albedo; atmospheric moisture; atmospheric transport; climate modeling; cloud cover; energy balance; energy flux; global warming; radiation budget",,,,,,"Alexeev, V., Langen, P., Bates, J., Polar amplification of surface warming on an aquaplanet in ghost forcing experiments without sea ice feedbacks (2005) Clim.
