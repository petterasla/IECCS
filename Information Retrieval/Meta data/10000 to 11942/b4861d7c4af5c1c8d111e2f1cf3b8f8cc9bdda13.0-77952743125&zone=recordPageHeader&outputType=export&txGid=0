In this study, the FAREAST gap model was used to examine the response of forest dynamics on Gongga Mountain, which is located on the southeastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau, under three climate change scenarios. The simulated results showed that the climax community of the deglaciation slash would be mixed species of Picea brachytyla, Tsuga chinensis, and Pinus densata under climate change scenarios, as opposed to the pure Abies fabri forest under the current climate. Climate change also drove replacement of Populus purdomiis by Betula utilis, which became the most abundant pioneer tree species on the deglaciation slash. Under scenarios of climate change, three responses of the four typical forests distributed between 2200 and 3580 m above sea level are observed, such as dieback of today's forest at 2200 and 3150 m, gradual change of the species composition at 2780 m, and afforestation at 3580 m. It is worth noting that the scenarios of climatic change are of inherent uncertainty, in the same way as the formulation of the ecological factors used in the models. It is suggested that simulations not be interpreted as predictions of the future development of the forest, but as a means of assessing their sensitivity to climate change. It is concluded that mountainous forests are quite sensitive to climate change. © The Japanese Forest Society and Springer 2009.","Climate change; Forest succession; Gap models; Species composition","Climate change scenarios; Climatic changes; Deglaciations; Ecological factors; Forest dynamics; Forest succession; Gap model; Global climate changes; Gradual changes; Mixed species; Pioneer tree species; Populus; Simulated results; Size structure; Southwest China; Species composition; Tibetan Plateau; Tree species composition; Climate models; Landforms; Oceanography; Reforestation; Climate change; abundance; afforestation; climate change; community composition; deglaciation; ecological modeling; forestry modeling; gap dynamics; numerical model; sea level; shrub; size structure; succession; Biodiversity; Ecology; Forests; Meteorology; Oceanography; Reforestation; Seasonal Variation; China; Gongga Mountain; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Sichuan; Abies; Abies fabri; Betula utilis; Picea; Picea brachytyla; Pinus densata; Populus; Tsuga; Tsuga chinensis",,,,,,"Bonan, G.B., Forests and climate change: Forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests (2008) Science, 320, pp. 1444-1449; Bonan, G.B., Shugart, H.H., Urban, D.L., The sensitivity of some high-latitude boreal forests to climatic parameters (1990) Clim Change, 16, pp. 9-29; Botkin, D.B., Janak, J.F., Wallis, J.R., Some ecological consequences of a computer model of forest growth (1972) J Ecol, 60, pp. 849-872; Bugmann, H., Sensitivity of forests in the European Alps to future climatic change (1997) Clim Res, 8, pp. 35-44; Bugmann, H., A review of forest gap models (2001) Clim Change, 51, pp. 259-305; Bugmann, H., Wullschleger, S.D., Price, D.T., Ogle, K., Clark, D.F., Solomon, A.M., Comparing the performance of forest gap models in North America (2001) Clim Change, 51, pp. 349-388; Cabrera, D., Mandel, J.T., Andras, J.P., Nydam, M.L., What is the crisis?
