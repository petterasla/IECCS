The impact on energy, especially energy consumption for heating and cooling of buildings, is very important. These influences are different in terms of space and time due to spatial and temporal variations of temperature. In this study, daily data of minimum and maximum temperature of 51 stations for 1959 - 2004 were used to detect annual and seasonal variations of heating and cooling degree-days in Xinjiang, China, by using the Mann - Kendall trend test and linear regression techniques. The results indicate that: (1) taking 18°C as the base temperature, annual mean heating degree-days (HDD) ranged between 2,700 and 7,973°C, and annual mean cooling degree-days (CDD) (the base temperature is 24°C) ranged between 0.4 and 792°C. CDDs are relatively low in Xinjiang; (2) autumn, winter, and annual HDDs show significant decreasing trends. Annual CDD at 23 out of 51 stations present significant increasing trends, while no remarkable positive trends can be observed at the other stations; and (3) with respect to spatial variations, Xinjiang was characterized by significant decreasing annual, winter, and autumn HDDs, and it was particularly true for the northern Xinjiang. The annual and summer CDDs in the western parts of northern Xinjiang (the edges of the Tarim Basin and the Turpan-Hami Basin) were characterized by significant increasing trends. However, no fixed spatial patterns can be identified in the variations of annual and summer CDDs. The results of this study could be useful for energy management in Xinjiang and are also helpful for better understanding of impacts of global warming on energy consumption in other countries of the world. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",,"climate variation; global warming; observational method; seasonal variation; spatial variation; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xinjiang Uygur",,,,,,"Badescu, V., Zamir, E., Degree-days, degree-hours and ambient temperature bin data from monthly-average temperatures (Romania) (1999) Energy Convers Manage, 40, pp. 885-900; Buyukalaca, O., Bulut, H., Yilmaz, T., Analysis of variable-base heating and cooling degree-days for Turkey (2001) Appl Energy, 69, pp. 269-283; Cartalis, C., Synodinou, A., Proedrou, M., Modification in energy demand in urban areas as a result of climate changes: An assessment for the southeast Mediterranean region (2001) Energy Convers Manage, 42, pp. 1647-1656; Chen, Z.H., Hong, B., Relationship between daily energy consumption and temperature in central China (2000) Acta Geogr Sin, 55 (SUPPL.), pp. 34-38. , (in Chinese); Chen, Y., Huang, C., Impact of climate change on energy demand (2000) Acta Geogr Sin, 55 (SUPPL.), pp. 11-19. , (in Chinese); (1996) Design Criterion for Energy Conservation of the Residential Building (Part of Heating), pp. 17-21. , Chinese Institute of Architectural Science (CIAS) China Architectural Industry Press, Beijing (in Chinese); Christenson, M., Manz, H., Gyalistras, D., Climate warming impact on degree-days and building energy demand in Switzerland (2006) Energy Convers Manage, 47, pp. 671-686; Ding, Y., Wang, Z., Sun, Y., Inter-decadal variation of the summer precipitation in East China and its association with decreasing Asian summer monsoon.
