In this paper, an attempt has been made to bridge this gap. By using a standard econometric model, the major (possible) impacts of an OECD carbon tax on developing countries under different policy options were examined. Implementing a carbon tax policy could set serious restrictions to the developmental efforts of the developing countries. The role of non-commercial energy-use vis-à-vis global warming was also investigated. The need for a global perspective when designing effective environmental policies is inevitable. © 1992.","Carbon tax; Developing countries; Global warming issue","carbon tax policy; climatic change; environmental tax; OECD",,,,,,"Walker, Global economic repercussions of a Pigouvian tax: who bears the brunt?
