Both kinds of assessment offer indisputable evidence that climate change and its effects on ecosystems are ongoing. However, both approaches often provide conservative estimates of the effects of climate change on ecosystems, because they do not consider the interplay and feedback among higher trophic levels in ecosystems, which may have a large effect on plant species composition and on ecosystem services such as productivity. Understanding the impacts of these top-down processes on ecosystems is critical for determining large-scale ecosystem response to climate change. Using examples of links between climate forcing, trophic interactions, and changes in ecosystem state in selected terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, we show that the ability to understand and accurately forecast future effects of climate change requires an integrated perspective, linking climate and the biotic components of the ecosystem as a whole.","Climate; Ecosystem function; Fauna; Global warming; Trophic levels",,,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Abrupt increase in Greenland snow accumulation and the end of the Younger Dryas event (1993) Nature, 362, pp. 527-529; Batchelet, D., Neilson, R.P., Lenihan, J.M., Drapek, R.J., Climate change effects on vegetation distribution and carbon budget in the United States (2001) Ecosystems, 4, pp. 164-185; Bonan, G.B., Soil temperature as an ecological factor in boreal forests (1992) A Systems Analysis of the Global Boreal Forest, pp. 126-143. , Shugart HH, Leemans R, Bonan GB, eds.
