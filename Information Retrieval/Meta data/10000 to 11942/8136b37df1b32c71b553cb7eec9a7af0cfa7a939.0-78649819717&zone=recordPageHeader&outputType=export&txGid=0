The objective of this study was to compare soil OC stocks and chemistry in jack pine stands located along a latitudinal climatic transect in central Canada. Total OC stocks (0-1 m) increased with decreasing mean annual temperature (MAT). We used a combination of physical fractionation of soil OC pools, 13C isotopic determination and cross-polarization, magic-angle spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to further characterize OC composition at all sites. Soil OC was dominated by labile pools. As illustrated by the C/N ratios, δ 13C data and results from the 13C NMR analysis, the light fraction showed little alteration within the soil profiles. Instead, this fraction reflected the importance of fresh litter inputs and showed an increase in root contribution with depth. As opposed to the light fraction, the clay- and silt-stabilized OC exhibited an increase in δ 13C and a decrease in C/N with depth, indicating an increase in its degree of decomposition. These changes with depth were more marked at the southern than the northern sites. Results hence suggest that if the MAT were to increase in the northern boreal forest the overall jack pine soil OC stocks would decrease but the remaining OC would become more decomposed, and likely more stabilized than what is currently present within the soils. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Boreal soils; Carbon stabilization; CPMAS 13C NMR; Jack pine; Soil fractionation; Soil organic matter","boreal forest; coniferous tree; global warming; isotopic analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil profile; stand dynamics; total organic carbon; Canada; Pinus banksiana",,,,,,"Baldock, J.A., Masiello, C.A., Gélinas, Y., Hedges, J.I., Cycling and composition of organic matter in terrestrial and marine ecosystems (2004) Marine Chemistry, 92, pp. 39-64; Baldock, J.A., Oades, J.M., Nelson, P.N., Skene, T.M., Golchin, A., Clarke, P., Assessing the extent of decomposition of natural organic materials using solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy (1997) Australian Journal of Soil Research, 35, pp. 1061-1083; Baldock, J.A., Preston, C.M., Carbon Forms and Functions in Forest Soils (1995) Chemistry of carbon decomposition processes in forests as revealed by solid-state carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, pp. 89-117. , (eds, McFee WW, Kelly JM) Soil Science Society of America Inc., Madison; Bhatti, J.S., Apps, M.J., Jiang, H., Influence of nutrients, disturbances and site conditions on carbon stocks along a boreal forest transect in central Canada (2002) Plant and Soil, 242, pp. 1-14; Bird, M., Santrùcková, H., Lloyd, J., Lawson, E., The isotopic composition of soil organic carbon on a north-south transect in western Canada (2002) European Journal of Soil Science, 53, pp. 393-403; Bol, R.A., Harkness, D.D., Huang, Y., Howard, D.M., The influence of soil processes on carbon isotope distribution and turnover in the British uplands (1999) European Journal of Soil Science, 50, pp. 41-51; Bryce, D.L., Bernard, G.M., Gee, M., Lumsden, M.D., Eichele, K., Wasylishen, R.E., Practical aspects of modern routine solid-state multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2001) Canadian Journal of Analytical Sciences and Spectroscopy, 46, pp. 46-82. , one-dimensional experiments; Christensen, B.T., Advances in Soil Science (1992) Physical fractionation of soil and organic matter in primary particle size and density separates, pp. 1-90. , In, Vol. 20 (ed, Stewart BA) Springer-Verlag, New York; Christensen, B.T., Physical fractionation of soil and structural and functional complexity in organic matter turnover (2001) European Journal of Soil Science, 52, pp. 345-353; Christensen, J.H., Hewitson, B., Busuioc, A., Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
