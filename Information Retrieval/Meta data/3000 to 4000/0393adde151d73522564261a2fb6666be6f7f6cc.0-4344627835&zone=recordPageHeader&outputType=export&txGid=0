Firstly, the price of conventional fossil fuel is too high and has added burden on the economy of the importing nations. Secondly, combustion of fossil fuels is the main culprit in increasing the global carbon dioxide (CO2) level, a consequence of global warming. The scarcity and depletion of conventional sources are also cases of concern and have prompted research world-wide into alternative energy sources for internal combustion engines. Biofuels appear to be a potential alternative ""greener"" energy substitute for fossil fuels. The problem of using neat vegetable oils in diesel engines relates to their high viscosity. Experiments were designed to study the effect of reducing viscosity by increasing the inlet temperature of vegetable oil fuel on combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine. The test results showed that the CO production with heated fuel is a little higher than the diesel fuel at higher loading conditions. The CO concentrations in the exhaust were higher for unheated oil operation compared to other fuels. The heated oil showed marginal increase in CO2 emissions compared to diesel fuel. The hydrocarbon emissions were significantly reduced when running on plant oils. The fuel consumption was a little worse when running on plant fuel. The ignition delay was longer for unheated plant fuel operation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
