Therefore, the predicted increase in the frequency of warming events in the tropics is expected to be critical for the survival of local species. This study explored the major environmental variables which were thought to be correlated with body temperatures (BTs) of the tropical snail Littoraria scabra at the niche level. A correlation between BT and substrate temperature (ST) was detected from field observations which suggests a possible causal relationship between both substrate and BTs. In contrast, there was no correlation between BT and air temperature. Field observations suggest that 33.4°C may be L. scabra upper limit of substrate surface temperature, although further experiments are needed to assess if the upper limit of physiological tolerance is actually different. As L. scabra individuals were free to choose their substrata, the observed distribution pattern at the niche level is related to L. scabra's behavior. Additionally, substrate surface temperatures were very heterogeneous at centimeter scale (i.e. from 22.5 to 53.1°C) and L. scabra was shown to select specific STs (i.e. between 22.5 and 33.4°C) rather than microhabitat type. Therefore, L. scabra did not seem to behaviorally thermoregulate through microhabitat selection nor aggregation. In contrast, behavioral experiments showed that L. scabra has the ability to actively select a thermally favorable site over short temporal scale (i.e. individual average speed of 1.26cmmin-1) following exposure to high temperatures above 33.4°C. Hence, this study supports the crucial need to integrate intertidal invertebrate behavioral responses to thermal constraints in climate change studies. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Behavioral adaptation; Extreme events; Fiji Islands; Gastropod; Global change; Littoraria scabra; Temperature; Thermal stress; Thermal tolerance; Tropical species","adaptation; behavioral response; body temperature; climate change; extreme event; gastropod; global change; microhabitat; substrate; survival; thermoregulation; Fiji; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Littoraria scabra",,,,,,"Alchanatis, V., Cohen, Y., Cohen, S., Evaluation of different approaches for estimating and mapping crop water status in cotton with thermal imaging (2010) Precision Agriculture, 11, pp. 27-41; Alfaro, A.C., Migration and trail affinity of snails, Littoraria scabra, on mangrove trees of Nananu-i-ra, Fiji islands (2007) Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology, 40, pp. 247-255; Alfaro, A.C., Diet of Littoraria scabra, while vertically migrating on mangrove trees (2008) Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 79, pp. 718-726. , gut content, fatty acid, and stable isotope analyses; Broitman, B.R., Szathmary, P.L., Mislan, K.A.S., Predator-prey interactions under climate change (2009) Oikos, 118, pp. 219-224. , the importance of habitat vs. body temperature; Bulanon, M., Burks, T.F., Alchanatis, V., Image fusion and thermal images for fruit detection (2009) Biosystems Engineering, 103, pp. 12-22; Chapperon, C., Seuront, L., Cue synergy in Littorina littorea navigation following dislodgement (2009) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 89, pp. 1133-1136; Chapperon, C., Seuront, L., Variability in the motion behaviour of intertidal gastropods (2010) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, , ecological and evolutionary perspectives., doi: DOI: 10.1017/S002531541000007X; Cheung, W.W.L., Lam, V.W.Y., Sarmiento, J.L., Projecting global marine biodiversity impacts under climate change scenarios (2009) Fish and Fisheries, 10, pp. 235-251; Christensen, J.T., Diet in Littoraria (1998) Hydrobiologia, 378, pp. 235-236; Compton, T.J., Rijkenberg, M.J.A., Drent, J., Thermal tolerance ranges and climate variability (2007) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 352, pp. 200-211. , a comparison between bivalves from differing climates; Crowe, T.P., Underwood, A.J., Testing behavioural 'preference' for suitable microhabitat (1998) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 225, pp. 1-11; Denny, M., Locomotion (1980) Science, 208, pp. 1288-1290. , the cost of gastropod crawling; Farnsworth, E.J., Ellison, A.M., Scale-dependent spatial and temporal variability in biogeography of mangrove root epibiont communities (1996) Ecological Monographs, 66, pp. 45-66; Garrabou, J., Coma, R., Bensoussan, N., Mass mortality in Northwestern Mediterranean rocky benthic communities (2009) Global Change Biology, 15, pp. 1090-1103. , effects of the 2003 heat wave; Garrity, S.D., Some adaptations of gastropods to physical stress on a tropical rocky shore (1984) Ecology, 65, pp. 559-574; Garrity, S.D., Levings, S.C., Aggregation in a tropical neritid (1984) Veliger, 27, pp. 1-6; Harley, C.D.G., Tidal dynamics, topographic orientation, and temperature-mediated mass mortalities on rocky shores (2008) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 371, pp. 37-46; Harley, C.D.G., Denny, M.W., Mach, K.J., Thermal stress and morphological adaptations in limpets (2009) Functional Ecology, 23, pp. 292-301; Hawkins, S.J., Moore, P.J., Burrows, M.T., Complex interactions in a rapidly changing world (2008) Climate Research, 37, pp. 123-133. , responses of rocky shore communities to recent climate change; Helmuth, B., How do we measure the environment?
