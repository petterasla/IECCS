Although the importance of uncertainty is recognized, most studies focus on individual stages of LCA, such as LCI and normalization and weighting stages of LCIA. However, an important question has not been answered in previous studies: Which part of the LCA processes will lead to the primary uncertainty? The understanding of the uncertainty contributions of each of the LCA components will facilitate the improvement of the credibility of LCA. Methodology: A methodology is proposed to systematically analyze the uncertainties involved in the entire procedure of LCA. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze the uncertainties associated with LCI, LCIA, and the normalization and weighting processes. Five LCIA methods are considered in this study, i.e., Eco-indicator 99, EDIP, EPS, IMPACT 2002+, and LIME. The uncertainty of the environmental performance for individual impact categories (e.g., global warming, ecotoxicity, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical smog, human health) is also calculated and compared. The LCA of municipal solid waste management strategies in Taiwan is used as a case study to illustrate the proposed methodology. Results: The primary uncertainty source in the case study is the LCI stage under a given LCIA method. In comparison with various LCIA methods, EDIP has the highest uncertainty and Eco-indicator 99 the lowest uncertainty. Setting aside the uncertainty caused by LCI, the weighting step has higher uncertainty than the normalization step when Eco-indicator 99 is used. Comparing the uncertainty of various impact categories, the lowest is global warming, followed by eutrophication. Ecotoxicity, human health, and photochemical smog have higher uncertainty. Discussion: In this case study of municipal waste management, it is confirmed that different LCIA methods would generate different assessment results. In other words, selection of LCIA methods is an important source of uncertainty. In this study, the impacts of human health, ecotoxicity, and photochemical smog can vary a lot when the uncertainties of LCI and LCIA procedures are considered. For the purpose of reducing the errors of impact estimation because of geographic differences, it is important to determine whether and which modifications of assessment of impact categories based on local conditions are necessary. Conclusions: This study develops a methodology of systematically evaluating the uncertainties involved in the entire LCA procedure to identify the contributions of different assessment stages to the overall uncertainty. Which modifications of the assessment of impact categories are needed can be determined based on the comparison of uncertainty of impact categories. Recommendations and perspectives: Such an assessment of the system uncertainty of LCA will facilitate the improvement of LCA. If the main source of uncertainty is the LCI stage, the researchers should focus on the data quality of the LCI data. If the primary source of uncertainty is the LCIA stage, direct application of LCIA to non-LCIA software developing nations should be avoided. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); Life cycle inventory (LCI); Municipal solid waste management; Quantification of uncertainty; System uncertainty; Uncertainties in LCA","acidification; article; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; Monte Carlo method; municipal solid waste; photochemical smog; priority journal; solid waste management; Taiwan; uncertainty",,,,,,"Andrae, A.S.G., Moller, P., Anderson, J., Liu, J., Uncertainty estimation by Monte Carlo simulation applied to life cycle inventory of cordless phones and microscale metallization processes (2004) IEEE T Electron Pack, 27, pp. 233-245. , 4; Baumann, H., Rydberg, T., Life cycle assessment: A comparison of three methods for impact analysis and evaluation (1994) J Clean Prod, 2, pp. 13-20. , 1; Bengtsson, M., Steen, B., Weighting in LCA-approaches and applications (2000) Environ Prog, 19, pp. 101-109. , 2; Bjorklund, A.E., Survey of approaches to improve reliability in LCA (2002) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 7, pp. 64-72. , 2; Bovea, M.D., Gallardo, A., The influence of impact assessment methods on materials selection for eco-design (2006) Mater des, 27, pp. 209-215. , 3; Brent, A.C., Hietkamp, S., Comparative evaluation of life cycle impact assessment methods with a South African case study (2003) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 8, pp. 27-38. , 1; Dreyer, L.C., Niemann, A.L., Hauschild, M.Z., Comparison of three different LCIA methods: EDIP97, CML2001 and Eco-indicator 99-does it matter which one you choose?
