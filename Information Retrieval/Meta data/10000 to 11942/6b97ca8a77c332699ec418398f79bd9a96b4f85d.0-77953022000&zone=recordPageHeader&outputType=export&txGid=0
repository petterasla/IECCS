However, the relationship between temperature and nutrient release is not well understood. We conducted a 2-year-long study to understand the yak dung decomposition and its potential response to climate change along an elevation gradient from 3,200 to 4,200 m above sea level on an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Mass loss of different chemical components of dung [organic carbon (C), cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, N, P, potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg)] significantly decreased with elevation. The ratios of C:N and N:P in the remaining dung increased significantly with decrease in elevation. The average temperature sensitivities (% °C-1) (i.e., increase of the mass loss (%) per 1°C temperature increase among elevations) were approximately 37, 75, 168, 41, 29, 37, 29, 34, and 31% per 1°C warming within a 273-day decomposition period, which decreased with decomposition time, for organic C, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, respectively. The temperature sensitivity of organic C mass loss is positively correlated to the C:N ratios in dung. The average temperature sensitivity of phosphorus mass loss was higher than that of nitrogen mass loss for the first 273 days and thereafter this situation was reversed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alpine meadow; Dung decomposition; Elevation gradient; Nutrient release; Temperature sensitivity","alpine environment; climate change; decomposition; future prospect; global warming; manure; meadow; nutrient cycling; recycling; temperature gradient; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Bos grunniens",,,,,,"Anderson, J.M., The effects of climate change on decomposition processes in grassland and coniferous forest (1991) Ecol Appl, 1, pp. 243-274; Anderson, J.M., Coe, M.J., Decomposition of elephant dung in an arid tropical environment (1974) Oecologia, 14, pp. 111-125; (1984) Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, , AOAC14th edn., Washington, DC: Association of Official Analytical Chemists; Cornelissen, J.H.C., Bodegom, P.M., Aerts, R., Global negative vegetation feedback to climate warming responses of leaf litter decomposition rates in cold biomes (2007) Ecol Lett, 10, pp. 619-627; Couteaux, M.M., Bottner, P., Berg, B., Litter decomposition, climate and litter quality (1995) Trends Ecol Evol, 10, pp. 63-66; Couteaux, M.M., Kurz, C., Bottner, P., Raschi, A., Influence of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration on quality of plant material and litter decomposition (1999) Tree Physiol, 19 (4-5), pp. 301-311; Daufresne, T., Loreau, M., Plant-herbivore interactions and ecological stoichiometry: When do herbivores determine plant nutrient limitation?
