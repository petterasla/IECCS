But the Bayesian framework often provides the primary way to respond to questions raised in these settings and the numbers and diversity of Bayesian applications have grown dramatically in recent years. Through a series of examples, both historical and recent, we argue that Bayesian approaches with formal and informal assessments of priors AND likelihood functions are well accepted and should become the norm in public settings. Our examples include censustaking and small area estimation, US election night forecasting, studies reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, assessing global climate change, and measuring potential declines in disability among the elderly. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2011.","Bayesian clinical drug studies; Census adjustment; Confidentiality; Disability measurement; Election night forecasting; Global warming; Small area estimation",,,,,,,"Airoldi, E., Fienberg, S.E., Joutard, C., Love, T., Discovering latent patterns with hierarchical Bayesian mixed-membership models (2007) Data Mining Patterns: New Methods and Applications, pp. 240-275. , (F.
