This study attempts to model climate-driven vegetation dynamics through the integration of satellite-derived NDVI data with climate data collected from ground-based meteorological stations in the US Great Plains. Monthly maximum value composites of NDVI data (8-km resolution) and monthly temperature and precipitation records from 305 stations were collected from 1982 to 2001. Analyses involving deseasonalized datasets supported temperature as the dominant climate regime, demonstrating a higher average NDVI-temperature correlation (r=0.73) than the NDVI-precipitation relationship (r=0.38). Cluster analysis was used to develop a climate regionalization scheme based primarily on temperature, and NDVI characteristics of each subregion were compared. In the context of global climate change, findings from this study emphasize the influence of temperature and precipitation variability over vegetation cover in the Great Plains region.",,"Advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRR); Atmospheric temperature; Cluster analysis; Precipitation (meteorology); Vegetation; Climate regionalization scheme; Normalized difference vegetation index; Satellite bioclimatology; Climate change; air temperature; AVHRR; bioclimatology; climate change; climate modeling; cluster analysis; data set; NDVI; precipitation (climatology); satellite imagery; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics; Great Plains; North America; United States",,,,,,"Adegoke, J.O., Carleton, A.M., Relations between soil moisture and satellite vegetation indices in the U.S. Corn Belt (2002) Journal of Hydrometeorology, 4, pp. 395-405; Bachelet, D., Neilson, R.P., Lenihan, J.M., Drapek, R.J., Climate change effects on vegetation distribution and carbon budget in the United States (2001) Ecosystems, 4, pp. 164-185; Bailey, R.G., (2002) Ecoregions: Ecoregion-Based Design for Sustainability, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Bonan, G.B., (2002) Ecological Climatology: Concepts and Applications, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Chen, X.Q., Pan, W.F., Relationships among phenological growing season, time-integrated normalized difference vegetation index and climate forcing in the temperate region of eastern China (2002) International Journal of Climatology, 22, pp. 1781-1792; Cihlar, J., St-Laurent, L., Dyer, J.A., Relation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and ecological variables (1991) Remote Sensing of Environment, 35, pp. 279-298; Cracknell, A.P., (1997) The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, , Taylor & Francis, London; DeFries, R.S., Hansen, M., Townshend, J.R.G., Global continuous fields of vegetation characteristics: A linear mixture model applied to multiyear 8km AVHRR data (2000) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 21, pp. 1389-1414; DeFries, R.S., Townshend, J.R.G., NDVI-derived land cover classification at a global scale (1994) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 15, pp. 3567-3586; Eklundh, L., Estimating relations between AVHRR NDVI and rainfall in East Africa at 10-day and monthly time scales (1998) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 19, pp. 563-568; Eltahir, E.A.B., A soil moisture - Rainfall feedback mechanism (1998) Water Resources Research, 34, pp. 765-776; Findell, K.L., Eltahir, E.A.B., Atmospheric controls on soil moisture-boundary layer interactions.
