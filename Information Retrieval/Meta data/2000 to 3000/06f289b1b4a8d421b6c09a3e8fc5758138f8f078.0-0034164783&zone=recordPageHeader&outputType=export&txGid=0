We simulated the monthly time-series and spatial distribution of atmosphere-biosphere CO2 exchange from 1961 to 1998, based on the Sim-CYCLE by inputting the NCEP/NCAR-reanalysis climate data at the spatial resolution of T62 (containing 5828 land pixels after the Matthews biome map). The peculiar climate conditions in 1998, i.e., strong ENSO event and global warming (+0.58°C above the long-term mean), resulted in a remarkable anomaly (as much as 2.7 Pg C yr-1 of net emission) via the accelerated plant respiration and soil decomposition. The strong sources were in eastern Siberia, northern South America, and South Africa. This anomaly, equivalent to +1.26 ppmv yr-1 of an increase rate of atmospheric CO2 concentration, can be a major cause of the extraordinarily high CO2 increase rate in 1998.",,,,,,,,"Bacastow, R.B., Modulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the southern oscillation (1976) Nature, 261, pp. 116-118; Braswell, B.H., Schimel, D.S., Linder, E., Moore B.
