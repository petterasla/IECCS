The first part deals with the need of CO2 removal and disposal in the strategy toward stabilization of the air concentration of CO2. A macroscopic survey of CO2 emission in developed world indicates that reduction of CO2 emission will be a hard task as long as we employ only conventional measures and therefore implementation of innovative measures is indispensable for mankind to mitigate global warming substantially. The results of a model study on CO2 stabilization indicates that CO2 removal from flue gas and storage in some niches of the earth will play an important role within several tens years. The second part deals with the issue of CO2 ocean disposal, with referring to a controversy on its effectiveness in mitigating global warming and concludes that it is effective but needs more study both on science of CO2 behavior in the ocean and characteristics of damage function of global warming. Lastly the paper discusses the global strategy for CO2 abatement, taking into full account different stances of countries in the world and stresses the importance of concerted efforts of developed countries for R&D on CO2 removal and disposal technologies. © 1995.",,"Air pollution control; Atmospheric composition; Global warming; International cooperation; Ocean dumping; Removal; Storage (materials); Carbon dioxide removal and disposal; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Kaya, Grand strategy for global warming (1989) Proc. of the governmental symposium on global environment; US DOE, The capture, utilization and disposal of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel-fired power plants (1993) DOE/ER-30194; Fujii, Kaya, Assessment of technology options for reducing CO2 emissions from man's global energy system (1993) Trans. of Inst.
