Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439, United States","Greenhouse gas policy decisions require comprehensive understanding of atmospheric, economic, and social impacts. Many studies have considered the effects of atmospheric uncertainty in global warming, but economic uncertainties have received less analysis. We consider a key component of economic uncertainty: the return on investments in new technologies. Using a mathematical programming model, we show that ignoring uncertainty in technology investment policy may lead to decreases as great as 2 percent in overall expected economic activity in the U.S. with even higher losses in possible future scenarios. These results indicate that both federal and private technology investment policies should be based on models explicitly incorporating uncertainty.",,"Climate change; Decision theory; Economics; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Mathematical programming; Technology; Atmospheric impact; Economic impact; Greenhouse gas policy decisions; Mathematical programming model; Social impact; Energy policy",,,,,,"Ausubel, J.H., Does Climate Still Matter (1991) Nature, 350, pp. 649-652; Benders, J.F., Partitioning Procedures for Solving Mixed-Variables Programming Problems (1962) Numerische Mathematik, 4, pp. 238-252; Birge, J.R., The Value of the Stochastic Solution in Stochastic Linear Programs with Fixed Recourse (1982) Mathematical Programming, 24, pp. 314-325; Birge, J.R., Decomposition and Partitioning Methods for Multi-Stage Stochastic Linear Programs (1985) Operations Research, 33, pp. 989-1007; Birge, J.R., Exhaustible Recourse Models with Uncertain Returns from Exploration Investment (1988) Numerical Techniques for Stochastic Optimization, pp. 481-488. , Y.
