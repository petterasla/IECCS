One approach, described in this paper, concerns the clean energy or zero-emissiong technologies. An original concept of a semi-closed zero emission ion transport membrane oxygen power (ZEITMOP) cycle is being developed. It can be compared to other research initiatives such as clean energy systems and zero-emission natural gas, as a response to the well-recognised challenges. As an answer to the crucial question of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions we propose new zero-emission fuel-fired power plants and boiler houses (ZEITMOP Boiler &amp; Air Coolerg Zero Emission Membrane Smokeless Heating). Zero-emission co-generation of power and heat allows such plants to be located in densely populated areas close to the consumer. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Clean energy; Combined CO2 cycles; Energy supply systems","carbon dioxide; oxygen; combustion; cooling; energy consumption; energy resource; field emission; greenhouse gas; heating; priority journal; review; technology",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Anderson, L.G., Olsen, A., (2002) Air-sea Flux of Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide in the North, p. 1835. , Atlantic: Geophys Res Lett; Energy Technologies at the Cutting Edge: IEA Report, CEDEX, Paris, 2005, , www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2005/IAH2005mep_Full_Final_WEB.pdf; Yantovski, E., Gorski, J., Shokotov, M., Zero Emissions Power Cycles, p. 2009. , Boca Raton, CRC Press; Marchetti, C., Energy systems - The broader context (1979) Technol Forecasting Social Change, 14, pp. 191-203; Foy, K., Yantovski, E., History and state-of-the-art of fuel fired zero emission power cycles (2006) Int J Thermodynamics, 9 (2), pp. 37-63; Marchetti, C., On geoengineering and the CO2 problem (1977) Climatic Change, 1 (1), pp. 59-68; Jericha, H., Efficient steam cycles with internal combustion of hydrogen and stoichiometric oxygen for turbines and piston engines (1987) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 12 (5), pp. 345-354; Jericha, H., Gttlich, E., Sanz, W., Heitmeir, F., Design optimisation of the Graz Cycle prototype plant (2004) ASME Trans J Eng Gas Turbines Power, 126 (3), pp. 733-740; Pak, P.S., Nakamura, K., Suzuki, Y., Closed dual fluid gas turbine power plant without emission of CO2 into the atmosphere Proceedings of IFAC/IFORS/IAEE Symposium on Energy Systems, Management and Economics, 25-27 Oct 1989; Mathieu, P., Presentation of an innovative zero-emission cycle for mitigating the global climate change (1998) Int.
