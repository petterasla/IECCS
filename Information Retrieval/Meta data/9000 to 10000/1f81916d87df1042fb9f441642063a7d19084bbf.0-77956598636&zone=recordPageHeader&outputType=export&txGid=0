Young Drive South, Los Angeles, CA 90095, United States","Ecohydrology and invasive ecology have become increasingly important in the context of global climate change. This study presents the first in-depth analysis of the water use of invasive and native plants of the same growth form at multiple scales: leaf, plant, and ecosystem. We reanalyzed data for several hundred native and invasive species from over 40 published studies worldwide to glean global trends and to highlight how patterns vary depending on both scale and climate. We analyzed all pairwise combinations of co-occurring native and invasive species for higher comparative resolution of the likelihood of an invasive species using more water than a native species and tested for significance using bootstrap methods. At each scale, we found several-fold differences in water use between specific paired invasive and native species. At the leaf scale, we found a strong tendency for invasive species to have greater stomatal conductance than native species. At the plant scale, however, natives and invasives were equally likely to have the higher sap flow rates. Available data were much fewer for the ecosystem scale; nevertheless, we found that invasive-dominated ecosystems were more likely to have higher sap flow rates per unit ground area than native-dominated ecosystems. Ecosystem-scale evapotranspiration, on the other hand, was equally likely to be greater for systems dominated by invasive and native species of the same growth form. The inherent disconnects in the determination of water use when changing scales from leaf to plant to ecosystem reveal hypotheses for future studies and a critical need for more ecosystem-scale water use measurements in invasive- vs. native-dominated systems. The differences in water use of native and invasive species also depended strongly on climate, with the greater water use of invasives enhanced in hotter, wetter climates at the coarser scales. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Evapotranspiration; Invasive plants; Leaf water potential; Native plants; Sap flow; Stomatal conductance; Transpiration; Water use efficiency","water; bootstrapping; climate change; comparative study; ecohydrology; evapotranspiration; invasive species; meta-analysis; native species; plant; sap flow; stomatal conductance; transpiration; water use efficiency; article; classification; climate; demography; ecosystem; meta analysis; metabolism; plant; plant leaf; Climate; Demography; Ecosystem; Plant Leaves; Plants; Water",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Baruch, Z., Fernandez, D.S., Water relations of native and introduced C4 grasses in a neotropical savanna (1993) Oecologia, 96, pp. 179-185; Baruch, Z., Goldstein, G., Leaf construction cost, nutrient concentration, and net CO2 assimilation of native and invasive species in Hawaii (1999) Oecologia, 121, pp. 183-192; Bosch, J.M., Hewlett, J.D., A review of catchment experiments to determine the effect of vegetation changes on water yield and evapotranspiration (1982) Journal of Hydrology, 55, pp. 3-23; Brauman, K.A., Daily, G.C., Duarte, T.K., Mooney, H.A., The nature and value of ecosystem services: An overview highlighting hydrologic services (2007) Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 32, pp. 67-98; Brock, M.T., Galen, C., Drought tolerance in the alpine dandelion, Taraxacum ceratophorum (Asteraceae), its exotic congener T. officinale, and interspecific hybrids under natural and experimental conditions (2005) American Journal of Botany, 92, pp. 1311-1321; Busch, D.E., Smith, S.D., Mechanisms associated with decline of woody species in riparian ecosystems of the southwestern U.S (1995) Ecological Monographs, 65, pp. 347-370; Calder, I.R., Dye, P., Hydrological impacts of invasive alien plants (2001) Land Use and Water Resources Research, 1, pp. 1-12; Cleverly, J.R., Dahm, C.N., Thibault, J.R., McDonnell, D.E., Coonrod, J.E.A., Riparian ecohydrology: Regulation of water flux from the ground to the atmosphere in the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico (2006) Hydrological Processes, 20, pp. 3207-3225; Cleverly, J.R., Smith, S.D., Sala, A., Devitt, D.A., Invasive capacity of Tamarix ramosissima in a Mojave Desert floodplain: The role of drought (1997) Oecologia, 111, pp. 12-18; Cordell, S., Cabin, R.J., Hadway, L.J., Physiological ecology of native and alien dry forest shrubs in Hawaii (2002) Biological Invasions, 4, pp. 387-396; Daehler, C.C., Performance comparisons of co-occurring native and alien invasive plants: Implications for conservation and restoration (2003) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, 34, pp. 183-211; Dawson, T.E., Burgess, S.S.O., Tu, K.P., Oliveira, R.S., Santiago, L.S., Fisher, J.B., Simonin, K.A., Ambrose, A.R., Nighttime transpiration in woody plants from contrasting ecosystems (2007) Tree Physiology, 27, pp. 561-575; Deans, J.D., Munro, R.C., Comparative water use by dryland trees in Parklands in Senegal (2004) Agroforestry Systems, 60, pp. 27-38; DeFalco, L.A., Bryla, D.R., Smith-Longozo, V., Nowak, R.S., Are Mojave Desert annual species equal?
