The model is able to reproduce many features of the observed cloud radiative forcing with considerable skill, such as the annual mean distribution, the response to seasonal forcing, and the response to SST variations in the equatorial Pacific. In addition to a reference experiment where the cirrus emissivity is computed as a function of the cloud water content, two sensitivity experiments have been performed. These three experiments are repeated identically, except for prescribing a globally uniform SST warming of 4 K. -from Authors",,"GCM; radiative forcing; sea surface temperature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2342445509
