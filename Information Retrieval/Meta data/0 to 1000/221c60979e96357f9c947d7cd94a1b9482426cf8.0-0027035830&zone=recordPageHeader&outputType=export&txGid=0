We add to the few existing statistical results by reporting tests for both deterministic and stochastic non-stationarity (trends) in time series of global average temperature. We conclude that the statistical evidence is sufficient to reject the hypothesis of a stochastic trend; however, there is evidence of a trend which could be approximated by a deterministic linear model. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"global warming; temperature trend; warming",,,,,,"Dickey, D.A., Fuller, W.A., Distribution of the Estimators for Autoregressive Time Series with a Unit Root (1979) J.
