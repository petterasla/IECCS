Acartia hudsonica occurs, at least seasonally, in estuaries from Chesapeake Bay to Labrador/Newfoundland. We sequenced the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome B (CytB) of 75 individuals of A. hudsonica from 26 estuaries from New Jersey to Maine, covering four biogeographic regions, and 11 individuals of Acartia tonsa from four of these estuaries in the southern part of the sampling range. A. hudsonica exhibited exceptionally high intraspecific DNA sequence variation. Uncorrected p-distances between sequences ranged from 0. 3 to 31%. Five highly divergent sequence groups differed in frequencies across populations and biogeographic regions. One sequence group dominated northern localities, and two sequence groups were found at intermediate to high frequencies in two southern biogeographic regions. Ages of the sequence groups were estimated to be 11, 13, 30, and 37 million years, by applying a molecular clock calibrated by divergence in Alpheus snapping shrimps across the Isthmus of Panama. These ages were compared with independent biogeographic paleoceanographic data, and may have coincided with periods of global climate change over the past 40 MY. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acartia hudsonica; Genomics; Mitochondrial DNA; Phylogeography","climate change; crustacean; genomics; Last Glacial Maximum; mitochondrial DNA; paleoceanography; phylogeography; zooplankton; Canada; Chesapeake Bay; Newfoundland and Labrador; United States; Acartia; Acartia hudsonica; Acartia tonsa; Alpheidae; Alpheus; Copepoda; Decapoda (Crustacea)",,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Meyers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) Journal of Molecular Biology, 215, pp. 403-410; Anderson, D.M., Keafer, B.A., Geyer, W.R., Signell, R.P., Loder, T.C., Toxic Alexandrium blooms in the western Gulf of Maine: the plume advection hypothesis revisited (2005) Limnology & Oceanography, 50, pp. 328-345; Bradford, J.M., Partial revision of the Acartia subgenus Acartiura (Copepoda: Calanoida: Acartiidae) (1976) New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 10, pp. 159-202; Bucklin, A., Frost, B.W., Kocher, T.D., DNA sequence variation of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA in Calanus (Copepoda: Calanoida): intraspecific and interspecific patterns (1992) Molecular Marine Biology & Biotechnology, 1, pp. 397-407; Bucklin, A., Frost, B.W., Kocher, T.D., Molecular systematics of six Calanus and three Metridia species (Calanoida: Copepoda) (1995) Marine Biology, 121, pp. 655-664; Bucklin, A., Sundt, R.C., Dahle, G., The population genetics of Calanus finmarchicus in the North Atlantic (1996) Ophelia, 44, pp. 29-45; Bucklin, A., Smolenack, S.B., Bentley, A.M., Wiebe, P.H., Gene flow patterns of the euphausiid, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, in the NW Atlantic based on mtDNA sequences for cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase I (1997) Journal of Plankton Research, 19, pp. 1763-1781; Bucklin, A., Guarnieri, M., Hill, R.S., Bentley, A.M., Kaartvedt, S., Taxonomic and systematic assessment of planktonic copepods using mitochondrial COI sequence variation and competitive, species-specific PCR (1999) Molecular Ecology of Aquatic Communities.
