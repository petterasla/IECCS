Here we test predictions of a new diffusion-reaction model of O2 distributions in egg masses, using egg masses of the Antarctic nudibranch mollusk, Tritonia challengeriana. When warmed from -1.5° to +1.5°C, embryos of T. challengeriana showed large increases in O2 consumption (Q10 values of 9.6-30.0). Oxygen electrode measurements in intact masses showed, however, that O 2 levels were high throughout and virtually unaffected by temperature. The model suggested that both effects stemmed from very low metabolic densities in egg masses. Detailed morphological measurements of egg masses of T. challengeriana and a temperate congener, T. diomedea, revealed large differences in structure that may be related to O2 availability. Egg masses of T. challengeriana were approximately twice as thick. However, the most dramatic effects were observed in embryos: embryos of T. challengeriana were &gt;32 times larger (by volume) than embryos of T. diomedea. Antarctic embryos also were contained singly in large egg capsules (∼500 μm diameter). Consequently, Antarctic embryos occurred at much lower densities, with very low metabolic densities.","Antarctica; Diffusion; Egg mass; Global warming; Marine; McMurdo Sound; Nudibranch; Oxygen; Polar gigantism; Size; Southern Ocean; Temperature; Tritonia","oxygen; animal; animal embryo; Antarctica; article; biological model; comparative study; cytology; metabolism; oocyte; oxygen consumption; physiology; prenatal development; sea; temperature; Tritonia sea slug; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Models, Biological; Oceans and Seas; Ovum; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Temperature; Tritonia Sea Slug; Mollusca; Tritonia diomedea",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Barnes, D.K.A., Bullough, L.W., Some observations on the diet and distribution of nudibranchs at Signy Island, Antarctica (1996) J.
