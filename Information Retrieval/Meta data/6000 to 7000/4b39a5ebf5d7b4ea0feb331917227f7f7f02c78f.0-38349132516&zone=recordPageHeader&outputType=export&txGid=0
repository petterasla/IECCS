Here, we use field releases of Drosophila melanogaster on two continents across a range of temperatures to test for costs and benefits of developmental or adult cold acclimation. Both types of cold acclimation had enormous benefits at low temperatures in the field; in the coldest releases only cold-acclimated flies were able to find a resource. However, this advantage came at a huge cost; flies that had not been cold-acclimated were up to 36 times more likely to find food than the cold-acclimated flies when temperatures were warm. Such costs and strong benefits were not evident in laboratory tests where we found no reduction in heat survival of the cold-acclimated flies. Field release studies, therefore, reveal costs of cold acclimation that standard laboratory assays do not detect. Thus, although physiological acclimation may dramatically improve fitness over a narrow set of thermal conditions, it may have the opposite effect once conditions extend outside this range, an increasingly likely scenario as temperature variability increases under global climate change. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Climate change; Field performance; Plasticity; Thermal adaptation; Thermal stress","animal experiment; article; assay; climate change; cold acclimatization; controlled study; Drosophila melanogaster; female; heat; low temperature; male; nonhuman; plasticity; priority journal; survival; temperature acclimatization; temperature stress; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Body Temperature Regulation; Climate; Cold; Drosophila melanogaster; Evolution; Female; Heat; Male; Models, Biological; Temperature; Time Factors; Animalia; Drosophila melanogaster",,,,,,"Walther, G.R., Berger, S., Sykes, M.T., (2005) Proc R Soc London Ser B, 272, pp. 1427-1432; Levins, R., (1969) Am Nat, 103, pp. 483-499; Prosser, C.L., (1986) Adaptational Biology: Molecules to Organisms, , Wiley, New York; Hoffmann, A.A., Daborn, P.J., (2007) Ecol Lett, 10, pp. 63-76; Huey, R.B., Berrigan, D., Gilchrist, G.W., Herron, J.C., (1999) Am Zool, 39, pp. 323-336; Hoffmann, A.A., Shirriffs, J., Scott, M., (2005) Funct Ecol, 19, pp. 222-227; Terblanche, J.S., Sinclair, B.J., Klok, C.J., McFarlane, M.L., Chown, S.L., (2005) J Insect Physiol, 51, pp. 1013-1023; Hoffmann, R.J., (1978) Am Nat, 112, pp. 999-1015; Hoffmann, A.A., (1995) Trends Ecol Evol, 10, pp. 1-2; Padilla, D.K., Adolph, S.C., (1996) Evol Ecol, 10, pp. 105-117; Loeschcke, V., Hoffmann, A.A., (2002) Trends Ecol Evol, 17, pp. 407-408; Wilson, R.S., Franklin, C.E., (2002) Trends Ecol Evol, 17, pp. 66-70; Kingsolver, J.G., (1999) Evolution, 53, pp. 1479-1490; Kingsolver, J.G., Huey, R.B., (1998) Am Zool, 38, pp. 545-560; Jaenike, J., Benway, H., Stevens, G., (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 383-391; Loeschcke, V., Hoffmann, A.A., (2007) Am Nat, 169, pp. 175-183; Kristensen, T.N., Loeschcke, V., Hoffmann, A.A., (2007) Proc R Soc London Ser B, 274, pp. 771-778; Kristensen, T.N., Loeschcke, V., Hoffmann, A.A., (2007) Cons Biol, , in press; Hoffmann, A.A., Ratna, E., Sgrò, C.M., Barton, M., Blacket, M., Hallas, R., De Garis, S., Weeks, A.R., (2007) J Evol Biol, 20, pp. 2219-2227; Hoffmann, A.A., Loeschcke, V., (2006) Evol Ecol Res, 8, pp. 813-828; Thomson, L.J., Robinson, M., Hoffmann, A.A., (2001) Funct Ecol, 15, pp. 217-221; Chown, S.L., Terblanche, J.S., (2007) Adv Insect Physiol, 33, pp. 50-152; Levins, R., (1968) Evolution in Changing Environments, , Princeton Univ Press, Princeton; Rako, L., Hoffmann, A.A., (2006) J Insect Physiol, 52, pp. 94-104; Le Bourg, E., (2007) Biogerontology, 8, pp. 431-444; Goto, S.G., Kimura, M.T., (1998) J Insect Physiol, 44, pp. 1233-1239; Rinehart, J.P., Yocum, G.D., Denlinger, D.L., (2000) Insect Biochem Mol Biol, 30, pp. 515-521; Zeilstra, I., Fischer, K., (2005) Physiol Entomol, 30, pp. 92-95; Crill, W.D., Huey, R.B., Gilchrist, G.W., (1996) Evolution (Lawrence, Kans), 50, pp. 1205-1218; Hoffmann, A.A., Sørensen, J.G., Loeschcke, V., (2003) J Therm Biol, 28, pp. 175-216; Piersma, T., Drent, J., (2003) Trends Ecol Evol, 18, pp. 228-233; Terblanche, J.S., Chown, S.L., (2006) J Exp Biol, 209, pp. 1064-1073; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Easterling, D.R., Meehl, G.A., Parmesan, C., Changnon, S.A., Karl, T.R., Mearns, L.O., (2000) Science, 289, pp. 2068-2074; Bubliy, O.A., Loeschcke, V., (2005) J Evol Biol, 18, pp. 789-803","Kristensen, T.N.; Department of Genetics and Biotechnology, University of Aarhus, P.O.
