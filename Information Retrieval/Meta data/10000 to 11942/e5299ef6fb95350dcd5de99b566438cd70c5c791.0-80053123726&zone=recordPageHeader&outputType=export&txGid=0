Protopolystoma xenopodis is a monogenean introduced with the amphibian Xenopus laevis from South Africa to Wales (probably in the 1960s) where low water temperatures impose major constraints on life-cycle processes. Effects were quantified by maintenance of eggs from infections in Wales under controlled conditions at 10, 12, 15, 18, 20 and 25 °C. The threshold for egg viability/ development was 15 °C. Mean times to hatching were 22 days at 25 °C, 32 days at 20 °C, extending to 66 days at 15 °C. Field temperature records provided calibration of transmission schedules. Although egg production continues year-round, all eggs produced during >8 months/ year die without hatching. Output contributing significantly to transmission is restricted to 10 weeks (May-mid-July). Host infection, beginning after a time lag of 8 weeks for egg development, is also restricted to 10 weeks (July-September). Habitat temperatures (mean 15·5 °C in summer 2008) allow only a narrow margin for life-cycle progress: even small temperature increases, predicted with global warming, enhance infection. This system provides empirical data on the metrics of transmission permitting long-term persistence of isolated parasite populations in limiting environments. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.","alien species introductions; development; global warming; Monogenea; Protopolystoma; temperature; Xenopus","article; controlled study; environmental temperature; hatching; life cycle; nonhuman; parasite; parasite identification; parasite survival; parasite transmission; parasitosis; priority journal; Protopolystoma xenopodis; species introduction; temperature dependence; water temperature; Xenopus laevis; Animals; Cell Survival; Environment; Female; Global Warming; Host-Parasite Interactions; Introduced Species; Life Cycle Stages; Ovum; Platyhelminths; Seasons; South Africa; Temperature; Time Factors; Trematode Infections; Wales; Water; Xenopus laevis; Amphibia; Monogenea; Protopolystoma; Protopolystoma xenopodis; Xenopus laevis",,"Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Bakke, T.A., Cable, J., Harris, P.D., The biology of gyrodactylid monogeneans: The ""russian-doll killers"" (2007) Advances in Parasitology, 64, pp. 161-376; Chubb, J.C., Seasonal occurrence of helminths in freshwater fishes.
