Influences of global warming and inter-annual variability imposed by El Niño events, amongst others, are sought. Notable trends include a decrease in the frequency of station days with rainfall > 70mm and an increase in station days with temperature > 38°C. Correlations offer some insights to extreme climate associations. Lows over the land in the west and over the sea to the east display consistent interannual variability, despite opposing rainfall regimes. Agreement in extreme temperature statistics in all regions suggest that drought is widespread over southern Africa. Rainfall in the north is negatively related to lows over the sea to the south. A potential mechanism underlying the inverse relationship between midlatitude and sub-tropical storminess is the development of a vorticity dipole associated with the westerly jet stream. This is investigated in an El Nino-influenced case study.",,"drought; El Nino; extreme weather; rainfall; Africa, (Southern)",,,,,,"Harangozo, A., Harrison, M.S.J., On the use of synoptic data in indicating the presence of cloud bands over southern Africa (1983) South African J.
