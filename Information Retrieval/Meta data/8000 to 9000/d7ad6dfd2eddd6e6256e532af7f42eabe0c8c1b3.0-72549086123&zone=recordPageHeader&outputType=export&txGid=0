The GHG accounting includes indirect upstream emissions, direct activities at the MRF as well as indirect downstream activities in terms of reprocessing of the metal scrap and savings in terms of avoided production of virgin metal. The global warming factor (GWF) shows that upstream activities and the MRF causes negligible GHG emissions (12.8 to 52.6 kg CO2-equivalents tonne -1 recovered metal) compared to the reprocessing of the metal itself (360-1260 kg CO2-equivalents tonne-1 of recovered aluminium and 400- 1020 kg CO2-equivalents tonne- 1 of recovered steel).The reprocessing is however counterbalanced by large savings of avoided virgin production of steel and aluminium. The net downstream savings were found to be 5040-19 340 kg CO2-equivalents tonne-1 of treated aluminium and 560-2360 kg CO2-equivalents tonne-1 of treated steel. Due to the huge differences in reported data it is hard to compare general data on the recovery of metal scrap as they are very dependent on the technology and data choices. Furthermore, the energy used in both the recovery process as well as the avoided primary production is crucial. The range of avoided impact shows that recovery of metals will always be beneficial over primary production, due to the high energy savings, and that the GHG emissions associated with the sorting of metals are negligible.","Aluminium recycling; CO2 accounting; Global warming; Green house gases; Metal; Recycling; Steel recycling; Waste management","Aluminium recycling; GHG emission; High energy; Material recovery facilities; Metal recycling; Metal scraps; Post consumer wastes; Primary production; Recovery process; Steel recycling; Aluminum; Carbon monoxide; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Hidden Markov models; Inclusions; Leakage (fluid); Metals; Recovery; Recycling; Scrap metal; Sorting; Structural frames; Waste management; Scrap metal reprocessing; aluminum; carbon dioxide; metal; steel; aluminum; emissions trading; global warming; greenhouse gas; metal; recycling; steel; waste management; air pollution; downstream processing; energy conservation; energy consumption; energy cost; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; industrial production; industrial waste; metal recovery; priority journal; review; solid waste management; Air Pollutants; Aluminum; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Metals; Refuse Disposal; Steel",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; steel, 12597-69-2; Air Pollutants; Aluminum, 7429-90-5; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Metals; Steel, 12597-69-2",,,,"Astrup, T., Møller, J., Fruergaard, T., (2009) Incineration and co-combustion of waste: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 789-799; Christensen, T.H., Why a special issue on greenhouse gas accounting in waste management?
