Ellis Ave., Chicago, IL 60637, United States","The energy consumption of animal- and plant-based diets and, more broadly, the range of energetic planetary footprints spanned by reasonable dietary choices are compared. It is demonstrated that the greenhouse gas emissions of various diets vary by as much as the difference between owning an average sedan versus a sport-utility vehicle under typical driving conditions. The authors conclude with a brief review of the safety of plant-based diets, and find no reasons for concern.","Diet; Energy consumption; Public health","Driving conditions; Plant-based diets; Sport utility vehicles; Energy utilization; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Public health; Nutrition",,,,,,"Appleton, B.S., Campbell, T.C., Inhibition of aflatoxin-initiated preneoplastic liver lesions by low dietary protein (1982) Nutr.
