However, known environmental impacts and the instability of the fossil-fuel market have revived the status of biofuels. Some concerns have appeared regarding how emerging global climate changes will affect biofuels' feedstock production, since agriculture is strongly dependent on climate variables. Th erefore, numerical models were introduced to calculate how temperature and precipitation could affect crop production for biodiesel and bioethanol production. Furthermore, 4 scenarios projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were put into the calculations. The results show that temperature has significant impact on feedstock production in all cases (P < 0.05), while precipitation seems to be less significant. If the temperature increases by 6.4 °C as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts, production of bioethanol made from sugar beets will decrease by as much as 70%. For other feedstocks, the share of production decrease will be smaller. Only biodiesel made of soybean will be positively affected by a temperature increase. Since global climate change will have negative impacts on feedstock for biofuel production, it is a challenge to meet the projected increases in biofuels' share in the fuel market. © TÜBİTAK.","Biofuels; Climate change; Fuel security; Transport energy","Bio-ethanol production; Biofuel production; Climate variables; Combustion engines; Crop production; Feedstock production; Fuel markets; Fuel security; Global climate changes; Global perspective; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Liquid biofuels; Negative impacts; Numerical models; Significant impacts; Temperature increase; Transport energy; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Liquids; Sugar beets; Sugars; Climate change; bioenergy; biofuel; climate change; crop production; energy market; numerical model; sustainability; temperature effect; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Glycine max",,,,,,"Al-Jaloud, A.A., Hussian, G., Krimulla, S., Al-Hamidi, A.A., Effect of irrigation and nitrogen on yield and yield components of two rapeseed cultivars (1996) Agr Water Manag, 30, pp. 57-68; Almaraz, J.J., Mabood, F., Zhou, X., Gregorich, E.G., Smith, D.L., Climate change, weather variability and corn yield at higher latitude locale: Southwester Quebec (2008) Clim Change, 88, pp. 187-197; Antoni, D., Zverlov, V.V., Schwarzt, W.H., Biofuels from microbes (2007) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 77, pp. 23-35; Azar, C., Lindgren, K., Anderson, B.A., Global energy scenarios meeting stringent CO2 constraints - cost effective fuel choices in the transportation sector (2003) Energ Pol, 31, pp. 961-976; Baker, J.M., Griffis, T.J., Evaluating the potential use of winter cover crops in corn-soybean system for sustainable coproduction of food and fuel (2009) Agr Forest Meteorol, 149, pp. 2120-2212; Baruch, J.J., Combating global warming while enhancing the future (2008) Technol Soc, 30, pp. 111-121; Bernard, F., Prieur, A., Biofuel market and carbon modelling to analyse French biofuel policy (2007) Energ Pol, 35, pp. 5991-6002; Bhatia, V.S., Singh, P., Wani, S.P., Chauhan, G.S., Kresava-Rao, A.V.R., Mishra, A.K., Srinivas, K., Analysis of potential yields and yield gaps of rain fed soybean in India using CROPGRO-Soybean model (2008) Agr Forest Meteorol, 148, pp. 1252-1265; Charles, M.B., Ryan, R., Ryan, N., Oloruntoba, R., Th e policy and biofuels: Th e way forward (2007) Energ Pol, 35, pp. 5737-5746; Chauhan, S.K., Gangopadhyay, S., Singh, N., Environmental aspects of biofuels in road transportation (2009) Environ Chem Lett, 7, pp. 289-299; Chiung-Lung, S., Yuh-Ming, L., Development status and life cycle inventory analysis of biofuels in Taiwan (2009) Energ Pol, 37, pp. 754-758; Clair, S., Hillier, J., Smith, P., Estimating the pre-harvest greenhouse gas costs of energy crop production (2008) Bio and Bioenerg, 32, pp. 442-452; Daǧdelen, N., Yilmaz, E., Sezgin, F., Gürbüz, T., Water-yield relation and water use effi ciency of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and second crop (Zea mays L.) in western Turkey (2006) Agr Water Manag, 82, pp. 63-85; Daroub, S.H., Gerakis, A., Ritchie, J.T., Friesen, D.K., Ryan, J., Development of a soil-plant phosphorus simulation model for calcareous and weathered tropical soils (2003) Agr Syst, 76, pp. 1157-1181; Daroub, S.H., Gerakis, A., Ritchie, J.T., Friesen, D.K., Ryan, J., Development of a soil-plant phosphorus simulation model for calcareous and weathered tropical soils (2003) Agr Syst, 76, pp. 1157-1181; Demirbas, A., Biofuels sources, biofuel policy, biofuel economy and global biofuel projections (2008) Energ Convers Manag, 49, pp. 2106-2116; Dogan, E., Kirnak, H., Copur, O., Effects of seasonal water stress on soybean and site specifi c evaluation of CROPGRO-Soybean model under semi-arid climatic conditions (2007) Agr Water Manag, 90, pp. 56-62; (2010), http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/default.aspx#ancor, Faostat Database, 14.10.2010Halleux, H., Lassaux, S., Renzoni, R., Germain, A., Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Two Biofuels Ethanol from Sugar Beet and Rapeseed Methyl Ester (2008) Int J LCA, 13, pp. 184-190; Hovelius, K., Hansson, P., Energy and exergy analysis of rape seed oil methyl ester (RME) production under Swedish conditions (1999) Bio and Bioenerg, 17, pp. 179-290; Ines, A.V.M., Hansen, J.W., Bias correction of daily GCM rainfall for crop simulation studies (2006) Agr Forest Meteorol, 138, pp. 44-53; Inman-Bamber, N.G., Muchow, R.C., Robertson, M.J., Dry matter partitioning of sugarcane in Australia and South Africa (2002) Field Crop Res, 76, pp. 71-84; Climate Change (2007) Synthesis Report, , http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf, IPPC-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Pachauri RK, Reisinger A.
