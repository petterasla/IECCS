This is particularly relevant in the tropics, where organisms are already living close to their upper temperature limits and hence are highly vulnerable to rising temperature. Here we present data on upper temperature limits of 34 tropical marine ectotherm species from seven phyla living in intertidal and subtidal habitats. Short term thermal tolerances and vertical distributions were correlated, i.e., upper shore animals have higher thermal tolerance than lower shore and subtidal animals; however, animals, despite their respective tidal height, were susceptible to the same temperature in the long term. When temperatures were raised by 1°C hour -1, the upper lethal temperature range of intertidal ectotherms was 41-52°C, but this range was narrower and reduced to 37-41°C in subtidal animals. The rate of temperature change, however, affected intertidal and subtidal animals differently. In chronic heating experiments when temperature was raised weekly or monthly instead of every hour, upper temperature limits of subtidal species decreased from 40°C to 35.4°C, while the decrease was more than 10°C in high shore organisms. Hence in the long term, activity and survival of tropical marine organisms could be compromised just 2-3°C above present seawater temperatures. Differences between animals from environments that experience different levels of temperature variability suggest that the physiological mechanisms underlying thermal sensitivity may vary at different rates of warming. © 2011 Nguyen et al.",,"animal experiment; article; Ascidiacea; Brachiopoda; controlled study; Crustacea; echinoderm; greenhouse effect; heat tolerance; intertidal species; invertebrate; marine species; microhabitat; mollusc; nonhuman; Polychaeta; Singapore; Sipuncula; species distribution; subtidal species; tropics; water temperature; animal; aquatic species; body size; ecosystem; feeding behavior; movement (physiology); physiology; species difference; statistical model; temperature; tropic climate; water flow; Animalia; sea water; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Body Size; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Global Warming; Linear Models; Movement; Seawater; Singapore; Species Specificity; Temperature; Tropical Climate; Water Movements",,,,,,"Castañeda, L., Lardies, M., Bozinovic, F., Adaptive latitudinal shifts in the thermal physiology of a terrestrial isopod (2004) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 6, pp. 579-593; Mora, C., Maya, M.F., Effect of the rate of temperature increase of the dynamic method on the heat tolerance of fishes (2006) Journal of Thermal Biology, 31, pp. 337-341; Williams, S.E., Bolitho, E.E., Fox, S., Climate change in Australian tropical rainforests: an impending environmental catastrophe (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B: Biological Sciences, 270, pp. 1887-1892; Stillman, J.H., Acclimation capacity underlies susceptibility to climate change (2003) Science, 301, p. 65; Deutsch, C.A., Tewksbury, J.J., Huey, R.B., Sheldon, K.S., Ghalambor, C.K., Impacts of climate warming on terrestrial ectotherms across latitude (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 105, pp. 6668-6672; Khoo, H.W., Chin, E., Thermal effects on some mangrove mollusks (1983) California Malacozoological Society, 26, pp. 119-123; Pochauri, R.K., Reisinger, A., Climate Change 2007: Synthesis report.Contribution of Working Group I, II and III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007), IPCC, Cambridge, Cambridge University PressClimate Change 2001: The Scientiflc Basis.to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2001), In: Houghton JT, editors, Cambridge, Cambridge University PressMayer, A.G., The effects of temperature on tropical marine animals (1914) Pap Tortugas Lab Carnegie Inst Washington, 6, pp. 3-24; Huey, R.B., Tewksbury, J.J., Can behavior douse the fire of climate warming?
