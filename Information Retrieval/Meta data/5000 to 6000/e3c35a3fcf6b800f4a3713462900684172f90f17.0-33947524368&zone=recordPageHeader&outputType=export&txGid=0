We examined distribution data on 56 bird species. If global warming is affecting species distributions across the temperate northern hemisphere, these data should show the same northward range expansions of birds that have been reported for Great Britain. Because a northward shift of distributions might be due to multidirectional range expansions for multiple species, we also examined the possibility that birds with northern distributions may be expanding their ranges southward. There was no southward expansion of birds with a northern distribution, indicating that there is no evidence of overall range expansion of insectivorous and granivorous birds in North America. As predicted, the northern limit of birds with a southern distribution showed a significant shift northward (2.35 km/year). This northward shift is similar to that observed in previous work conducted in Great Britain: the widespread nature of this shift in species distributions over two distinct geographical regions and its coincidence with a period of global warming suggests a connection with global climate change. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.","Avian distributions; Breeding distributions; Climate change; Global warming; North American birds; Range shifts","bioindicator; bird; breeding population; global warming; Northern Hemisphere; population distribution; range expansion; animal; animal behavior; article; bird; climate; demography; geography; greenhouse effect; North America; physiology; species difference; Animals; Birds; Climate; Demography; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Homing Behavior; North America; Species Specificity; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Aves",,,,,,"Cade, T.J., Woods, C.P., Changes in distribution and abundance of the Loggerhead Shrike (1997) Conservation Biology, 11, pp. 21-31; Crozier, L., Warmer winters drive butterfly range expansion by increasing survivorship (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 231-241; Crumpacker, D.W., Box, E.O., Hardin, E.D., Implications of climactic warming for conservation of native trees and shrubs in Florida (2001) Conservation Biology, 15, pp. 1008-1020; Falardeau, G., Desgranges, J.L., Habitat selection and recent fluctuations in populations of farmlands in Quebec (1991) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 105, pp. 469-482; Fleishman, E., Mac Nally, R., Distinguishing between signal and noise in faunal responses to environmental change (2003) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 12, pp. 395-402; Fortin, M.J., Keitt, T.H., Maurer, B.A., Taper, M.L., Kaufman, D.M., Blackburn, T.M., Species geographic ranges and distributional limits: Pattern analysis and statistical issues (2005) Oikos, 108, pp. 7-17; Gaston, J.G., Blackburn, T.M., Large-scale dynamics in colonization and extinction for breeding birds in Britain (2002) Journal of Animal Ecology, 71, pp. 390-399; Hughes, L., Biological consequences of global warming: Is the signal already apparent?
