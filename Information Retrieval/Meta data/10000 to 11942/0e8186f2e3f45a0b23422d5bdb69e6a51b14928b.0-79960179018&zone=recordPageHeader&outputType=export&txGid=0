Agriculture is the main occupation of the tribe and they have a unique way of knowing plantation season for different crops by observing the flowering of some plants. The indicator plants are peach (Prunus persica), wild cherry (P. carmesina), camel foot (Bauhinia purpurea) and dancing girl (Mantisia spathulata). The information on plants used as season indicators may help understanding the global warming and climate change in recent years. There is a need for involving interdisciplinary research to unveil the mystery of folklore science for the prosperity of mankind.","Agricultural seasons; Indicator plants; Manipur; Mao naga tribe",,,,,,,"Ferry, B.W., Baddeley, M.S., Hawsworth, D.L., (1973) Air Pollution and Lichens, , Academic Press, London; Gilbert, O.L., Lichens and air pollution (1973) The Lichens, pp. 443-469. , edited by Ahmadjian V & Hale ME, Academic Press, London; Shacklette, H.T., The use of aquatic bryophytes in prospecting (1984) J Geochme Expl, 21, pp. 89-93; Lakshmanan, K.K., The use of plants in prospecting for metals (1995) Everymans'sSci, 5, pp. 145-146; Ghosh, D., Metallophytes (2000) Sci Cult, 66 (7-8), pp. 250-252; Saklani, A., Jain, S.K., Ethnobotanical observation on plants used in Northeastern India (1989) Int J Crude Drug Res, 27 (2), pp. 65-73; Jamir, N.S., Studies on some Medico-Herbs from North East India (1991) Recent Adv Med Arom Spice Crops, 1, pp. 235-239; Mao, A.A., A preliminary report on the folklore botany of Mao Naga of Manipur (India) (1993) Ethnobotany, 5, pp. 143-147; Mao, A.A., Some symbolic and superstitious botanical folklore about Mao Naga tribe of Manipur (India) (1999) J Econ Taxon Bot, 23 (2), pp. 625-628; Dutta, B.K., Dutta, P.K., Potential of ethnobotanical studies in North East India: An overview (2005) Indian J Tradit Knowle, 4 (1), pp. 7-14; Samati, H., Begum, S.S., Plant indicators for agricultural seasons among Pnar tribe of Meghalaya (2006) Indian J Tradit Knowle, 5 (1), pp. 57-59","Mao, A.; Botanical Survey of India, Arunachal Pradesh Circle, Senki View, Itanagar-791 111, India; email: aamao2008@gmail.com",,,,,,,,09725938,,,,"English","Indian J.
