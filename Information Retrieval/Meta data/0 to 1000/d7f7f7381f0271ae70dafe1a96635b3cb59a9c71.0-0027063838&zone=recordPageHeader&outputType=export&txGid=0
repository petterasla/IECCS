The rate and amount of the urban climate change approximate those being predicted globally using climate models. Knowledge of urban weather and climate modification holds lessons for the global climate change issue. First, adjustments to urban climate changes can provide guidance for adjusting to global change. A second lesson relates to the difficulty but underscores the necessity of providing scientifically credible proof of change within the noise of natural climatic variability. -from Author",,"climate change; global change; urban area; weather modification",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027063838
