Recent studies have lead to a debate over what contributes the most to regional temperature changes. We investigated air temperature patterns in California from 1950 to 2000. Statistical analyses were used to test the significance of temperature trends in California subregions in an attempt to clarify the spatial and temporal patterns of the occurrence and intensities of warming. Most regions showed a stronger increase in minimum temperatures than with mean and maximum temperatures. Areas of intensive urbanization showed the largest positive trends, while rural, non-agricultural regions showed the least warming. Strong correlations between temperatures and Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) particularly Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) values, also account for temperature variability throughout the state. The analysis of 331 state weather stations associated a number of factors with temperature trends, including urbanization, population, Pacific oceanic conditions and elevation. Using climatic division mean temperature trends, the state had an average warming of 0.99°C (1.79°F) over the 1950-2000 period, or 0.20°C (0.36°F) decade-1. Southern California had the highest rates of warming, while the NE Interior Basins division experienced cooling. Large urban sites showed rates over twice those for the state, for the mean maximum temperatures, and over 5 times the state's mean rate for the minimum temperatures. In comparison, irrigated cropland sites warmed about 0.13°C decade-1 annually, but near 0.40*C for summer and fall minima. Offshore Pacific SSTs warmed 0.09°C decade-1 for the study period. © Inter-Research 2007.","California climate; Climate variability; Landuse change","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Global warming; Land use; Statistical methods; United States; air temperature; climate change; global warming; land use change; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; sea surface temperature; California; North America; United States",,,,,,"Alfaro, E., Gershunov, A., Cayan, D., Steinemann, A., Pierce, D., Barnett, T., A method for prediction of California summer air surface temperature (2004) Eos Trans Am Geophys Union, 85 (553), pp. 557-558; Balling Jr, R.C., Idso, C.D., Analysis of adjustments to the United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) temperature database (2002) Geophys Res Lett, 29 (10), pp. 25-1-25-3. , doi:10.1029/2002GL014825; Bereket, L., Fabris, D., Gonzalez, J.E., Chiappari, S., Zarantonello, S., Miller, N.L., Bornstein, R., Climatology temperature mapping for California urban heat island study site selection (2005) Am Meteorol Soc Atmos Sci Air Qual Conf, , Paper 6.4, San Francisco, CA, 27-29 April; Braganza, L., Karoly, D.J., Arblaster, J.M., Diurnal temperature range as an index of global climate during the twentieth century (2004) Geophys Res Lett, 31 (13). , doi:10.1029/2004GL019998; Bratcher, A.J., Giese, B.S., Tropical Pacific decadal variability and global warming (2002) Geophys Res Lett, 29 (19), pp. 24-1-24-4. , doi:10.1029/ 2002GL015191; Christy, J., Norris, W.B., Irrigation-induced warming in central California?
