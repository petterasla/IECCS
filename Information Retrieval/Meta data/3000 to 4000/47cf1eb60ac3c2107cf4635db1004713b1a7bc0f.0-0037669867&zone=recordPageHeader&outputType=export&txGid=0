Present levels of anthropogenic emissions involve 6·3 Pg C by fossil fuel emissions and 1·8 Pg C by land-use change. Out of the historic loss of terrestrial C pool of 136 ± 55 Pg, 78 ± 12 Pg is due to depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool comprising 26 ± 9 Pg due to accelerated soil erosion. A large proportion of the historic SOC lost can be resequestered by enhancing the SOC pool through converting to an appropriate land use and adopting recommended management practices (RMPs). The strategy is to return biomass to the soil in excess of the mineralization capacity through restoration of degraded/desertified soils and intensification of agricultural and forestry lands. Technological options for agricultural intensification include conservation tillage and residue mulching, integrated nutrient management, crop rotations involving cover crops, practices which enhance the efficiency of water, plant nutrients and energy use, improved pasture and tree species, controlled grazing, and judicious use of inptus. The potential of SOC sequestration is estimated at 1-2 Pg C yr-1 for the world, 0·3-0·6 Pg C yr-1 for Asia, 0·2-0·5 Pg C yr-1 for Africa and 0·1-0·3 Pg C yr-1 for North and Central America and South America, 0·1-0·3 Pg C yr-1 for Europe and 0·1-0·2 Pg C yr-1 for Oceania. Soil C sequestration is a win-win strategy; it enhances productivity, improves environment moderation capacity, and mitigates global warming. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Global climate change; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil rehabilitation","Combustion; Degradation; Erosion; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Land reclamation; Fossil fuel emissions; Soils; agricultural intensification; agricultural management; carbon sequestration; soil carbon; soil management; soil remediation; Oceania",,,,,,"Albrecht, J., (2002) Instruments for Climate Policy: Limited Versus Unlimited Flexibility, , (ed.).
