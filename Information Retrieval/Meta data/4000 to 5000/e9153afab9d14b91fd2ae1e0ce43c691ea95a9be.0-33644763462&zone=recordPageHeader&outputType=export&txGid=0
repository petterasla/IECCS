Early identification of populations at risk enables timely and appropriate action. Since large and widely dispersed populations depend on rainfed agriculture and pastoralism, climate monitoring and forecasting are important inputs to food security analysis. Satellite rainfall estimates (RFE) fill in gaps in station observations, and serve as input to drought index maps and crop water balance models. Gridded rainfall time-series give historical context, and provide a basis for quantitative interpretation of seasonal precipitation forecasts. RFE are also used to characterize flood hazards, in both simple indices and stream flow models. In the future, many African countries are likely to see negative impacts on subsistence agriculture due to the effects of global warming. Increased climate variability is forecast, with more frequent extreme events. Ethiopia requires special attention. Already facing a food security emergency, troubling persistent dryness has been observed in some areas, associated with a positive trend in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures. Increased African capacity for rainfall observation, forecasting, data management and modelling applications is urgently needed. Managing climate change and increased climate variability require these fundamental technical capacities if creative coping strategies are to be devised. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Africa; Climate; Ethiopia; Food security","climate change; climate forcing; climate prediction; early warning system; extreme event; famine; food security; global warming; pastoralism; rainfall; rainfed agriculture; sea surface temperature; streamflow; subsistence agriculture; weather forecasting; Africa; East Africa; Ethiopia; Sub-Saharan Africa; rain; Africa south of the Sahara; catering service; climate; crop; environment; Ethiopia; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; human; review; socioeconomics; standard; Africa South of the Sahara; Climate; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Ethiopia; Food Supply; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Rain; Socioeconomic Factors",,,,,,"Anyamba, A., Eastman, R., Interannual variability of NDVI over Africa and its relation to El Niño/southern oscillation (1996) Int.
