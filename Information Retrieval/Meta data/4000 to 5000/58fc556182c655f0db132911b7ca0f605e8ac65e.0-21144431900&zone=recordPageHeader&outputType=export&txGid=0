The purpose of this research was to (1) review the literature to examine how changes in grassland management that affect soil C also impact soil N, (2) assess the impact of different types of grassland management on changes in soil N and rates of change, and (3) evaluate changes in N2O fluxes from differently managed grassland ecosystems to assess net impacts on GWP. Soil C and N stocks either both increased or both decreased for most studies. Soil C and N sequestration were tightly linked, resulting in little change in C:N ratios with changes in management. Within grazing treatments N2O made a minor contribution to GWP (0.1-4%), but increases in N2O fluxes offset significant portions of C sequestration gains due to fertilization (10-125%) and conversion (average = 27%). Results from this work demonstrate that even when improved management practices result in considerable rates of C and N sequestration, changes in N2O fluxes can offset a substantial portion of gains by C sequestration. Even for cases in which C sequestration rates are not entirely offset by increases in N2O fluxes, small increases in N2O fluxes can substantially reduce C sequestration benefits. Conversely, reduction of N2O fluxes in grassland soils brought about by changes in management represents an opportunity to reduce the contribution of grasslands to net greenhouse gas forcing. © Springer 2005.","Grassland; Grassland management; Greenhouse gases; Nitrous oxide; Soil carbon","grassland; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa; World",,,,,,"Bardgett, R.D., Frankland, J.C., Whittaker, J.B., The effects of agricultural practices on the soil biota of some upland grasslands (1993) Agric.
