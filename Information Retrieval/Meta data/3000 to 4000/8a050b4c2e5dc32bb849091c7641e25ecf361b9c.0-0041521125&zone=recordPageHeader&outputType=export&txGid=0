Industrial trials are reported for the production of belite cements (≈3000 t) at lower temperatures and with lower lime saturation factors than for ordinary Portland cement. Belite cements with reasonably good properties have been made on an industrial scale from limestone, burnt clay, volcanic ash, pyrite ash and gypsum. A rapid rate of cooling improves the hydraulic activity, and also the physical-mechanical properties by stabilising reactive forms of belite. Such low energy cements provide a cheap alternative to Portland cement with properties that are acceptable for many applications and the additional benefit of possible improved durability. © 2002 Elsevier Ltd.
