Benefits could accrue to farmers, due to beneficial effects of soil organic carbon on productivity, and to society by managing land to increase soil carbon. Measurements are needed to determine if practices aimed at increasing carbon levels are effective and to quantify amounts of carbon stored for verification purposes. However, measurements are expensive and have high errors relative to annual changes in soil carbon. In this article, we develop an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approach that combines measurements with predictions from a simple model, taking into account errors in measurements, model parameters, and model predictions. The EnKF was used to estimate soil carbon at annual time steps and to estimate an uncertain soil carbon decomposition rate parameter. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on EnKF estimates of uncertainties in measurements, model predictions, and the decomposition rate parameter. The EnKF estimates of soil carbon were compared with true values that were generated using a Monte Carlo method. Results showed that EnKF estimates of soil carbon levels and annual changes of soil carbon were more accurate than measurements alone for all combinations of conditions studied. The root mean square error of estimation was reduced from around 700 kg/ha based on measurements alone to about 225 kg/ha using the EnKF procedure. The unknown soil carbon decomposition parameter converged to its true value after about seven years. This EnKF method can be modified to incorporate more comprehensive models of cropping systems and soil carbon, to incorporate spatial variability, and to assimilate remote sensing inputs. It is simple to implement and has considerable promise for practical use in soil carbon sequestration projects.","Data assimilation; Soil carbon; Stochastic model; Uncertainty","Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Global warming; Kalman filtering; Monte Carlo methods; Productivity; Remote sensing; Soils; Carbon storage sinks; Mean square errors; Agriculture; estimation method; Kalman filter; methodology; soil carbon; stochasticity",,,,,,"Adams, R.M., Rosenzweig, C., Peart, R.M., Ritchie, J.T., McCarl, B.M., Glyer, J.D., Curry, R.B., Allen Jr., L.H., Global climate change and U.S. agriculture: An interdisciplinary assessment (1990) Nature, 345, pp. 219-224; Albiol, J., Robuste, J., Casas, C., Poch, M., Biomass estimation in plant cell cultures using an extended Kalman filter (1993) Biotech.
