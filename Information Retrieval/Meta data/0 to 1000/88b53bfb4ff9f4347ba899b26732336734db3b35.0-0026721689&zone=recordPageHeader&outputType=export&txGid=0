Four of the five major classes of climate in the world are found in British Columbia, where prevailing westerly winds from the Pacific and a series of north-south mountain ranges have produced widely differing local climates. The predicted global warming may result in the migration of species and communities upslope and toward the north, but the heterogeneous nature of the present landscape suggests that such migration may not be as pronounced as that likely to occur in regions of Canada with less relief. Effects of climatic warming on long-lived temperate zone trees include possible increased frost damage in early spring; reduced seed production; increased insect and disease incidence; increased damage to forests by wildfire; and, in the warmer parts of coastal British Columbia, a winter climate too warm to satisfy the chilling requirements of some perennial plants.",,"carbon; agriculture; canada; climate; conference paper; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental temperature; fire protection; forest; greenhouse effect; pest control; plant growth; productivity; seasonal variation; soil; vegetation",,"carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,,"Lavender, D.P.; Forest Sciences Department, 2357 Main Mall, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",,,,,,,,07307268,,ETOCD,,"English","ENVIRON.
